            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The site comprises 225 ha of predominantly agricultural land and lies predominantly to the east of the M1. The town of Lutterworth lies to the west of the motorway. A proportion of the residential development, 40%, would be provided as affordable housing. There would be 10 ha of B1/B2 general employment land, 13 ha for B8 storage and distribution uses and 111 ha for green infrastructure. Condition 3 of the permission restricted the development to the principles and parameters shown in a number of specified documents. Condition 5 required a phasing programme to be approved and then the development to be carried out in accordance with that programme. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">HDC adopted the Harborough Local Plan 2011-2031 on 30 April 2019. The spatial strategy in Policy SS1 requires 12,800 dwellings to be provided during the plan period. Much of that figure comprises development already completed, or committed by the grant of planning permissions.  The site is allocated as a strategic development area (“SDA”).  It is the largest allocation in the Local Plan and represents about a third of the housing allocated in the district (see Policy H1). The site is to provide 1,260 new homes during the plan period to 2031. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">HDC’s housing trajectory assumed in 2019 that housing completions on the site would begin in 2023/4 and continue through to 2030/31. It was also assumed that about 1,490 homes would be completed between 2031 and 2036, after the end of the local plan period. So it was projected that 25 dwellings would be completed in 2023/4, rising to about 200 dwellings a year during the period 2027/8 to 2030/31. It is estimated that the 23 ha of employment land will generate about 2,500 new jobs. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Policy L1 of the Local Plan allocated the Lutterworth SDA as a “new neighbourhood”, a sustainable urban extension to Lutterworth with facilities for living, working and recreation. Thus, in addition to the employment land, Policy L1 requires the provision of community facilities, including two 2-form entry primary schools in parallel with the progress of the housing development, appropriate contributions to secondary education if necessary and a neighbourhood centre. That centre is to include shops to meet local needs, a public house or café, a doctor’s surgery and a community hall. In other words, the educational and medical facilities to be provided on site are those which would be expected for a sustainable community on this scale. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Trust does not object to the development as a matter of principle. The central issue in this case is whether HDC erred in law by not requiring the payment of a contribution under s.106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (“TCPA 1990”) of about £914,000 towards the delivery of health care by the Trust to mitigate what are said to be the harmful effects of additional demands upon its services from that proportion of the people moving to the site who would be new to the Trust’s area (referred to as “new residents”). The Trust estimates that the 2,750 houses on the site would accommodate 7,520 people, of whom 38.5%, or 2,896 people, would be new residents in the Trust’s area. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Under the legislation governing the National Health Service (“NHS”), the Trust is responsible for providing acute services to NHS commissioning bodies, who at the relevant time were the Clinical Commissioning Groups (“CCGs”). According to the Trust’s representations to HDC, the relevant CCGs were the Leicester CCG, the Leicestershire CCG and the Rutland CCG. Mr. Cairnes KC, who together with Dr. Bowes appeared on behalf of the claimant, told the court that the geographical area covered by these three CCGs is co-extensive with that of the Trust. There are about 1 million residents in that area (para. 2 of claimant’s skeleton). </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From the 2020/21 financial year the CCGs pay for services provided by the Trust under a block contract. Those payments represent the Trust’s main source of income to pay for its acute care services. Under a block contract a trust receives a lump sum in respect of all the services contracted for, in contrast to a “pay by results” arrangement, under which a trust receives a rate for each patient actually treated for the condition treated. As Haddon-Cave LJ explained in R (Shepherd) v NHS Calderdale Clinical Commissioning Group and Monitor [2019] PTSR 790 at [44], a block contract provides for payment by way of a fixed sum regardless of the number and type of activities undertaken by the provider of services. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Each of the Trust’s block contracts lasts for one year and are re-negotiated at the end of that year. The funding paid by a CCG “is based upon locally agreed planned activity which is informed by the previous year’s activity”. If the activity during the year of a block contract is greater than that which was assumed in arriving at the lump sum figures, the Trust is not entitled to any additional payment, whether during that year or retrospectively in the next year (see claimant’s skeleton para. 40). Equally if the level of activity during a year turns out to be less than had been assumed for the purposes of the contract, the Trust is not required to repay any money to the CCGs. One advantage of block contracts is that they facilitate financial planning by a trust (see para. 36 of the claimant’s skeleton). </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Trust’s concern relates solely to the first financial year (or more precisely that part of the financial year) in which a “new resident” begins to occupy a dwelling and is treated by the Trust. It says that any treatment it provides for such residents is not accounted for in the funding agreed under the block contract for that year. Net increases in population from new development are not inputs to the funding mechanisms used within the NHS or the negotiations for block contracts. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Trust is operating at what it describes as “full capacity”. But even so, it is not able to turn away new residents living on the site, whether for that reason or because the block contract has not allowed for that additional activity. Instead, those patients will be treated, but there will be a consequential increase in the time taken to provide treatment for patients in general. In addition, there will be delays in being able to allocate patients on arrival to the appropriate type of bed, because the relevant occupancy benchmark is already exceeded. The Trust’s case is that these adverse impacts on the timing of treatment appropriate for achieving good health outcomes and on the health of the community are land use planning considerations relevant to the determination of the planning application for the Lutterworth SDA. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the Trust has often objected to the use of the term “funding gap”, the Trust itself has used that language in its representations to HDC in order to explain its case on how the development will cause those impacts (see e.g. pp.37 and 39 of Appendix 7 to the Trust’s representations dated 23 July 2020 - answers to questions 1 and 3). As Mr. Cairnes KC rightly accepted, if the Trust could not point to a funding gap for the provision of health services attributable to the occupation of housing on the site, there would be no relevant impacts from the SDA scheme to justify a s.106 contribution. Equally, and as a matter of common sense, the size of that gap would be relevant to determining the amount of any s.106 contribution which may be justified. As a result of this concession many of the Trust’s complaints in this case fall away. Nevertheless, I will address the arguments </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is important to note that the Trust’s case relates solely to an alleged funding gap during the first financial year in which a new resident occupies a dwelling on the site. This is because the Trust accepts that when the block contract comes to be re-negotiated for the next financial year, the baseline population used in arriving at a revised lump sum figure takes into account new residents who have arrived at some point in the previous financial year. The Trust also accepts that there is no justification for requiring the developer/landowner of the site to make a contribution to its funding to cover any impact upon its health services arising from those same people after the financial year in which they start to live on the site. It is accepted that that is a cost for which NHS funding should be, and is, provided. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">To put the Trust’s concern into a practical context, we are talking about additional pressure on acute services from development on the site reaching 210 or so new homes in any one year.  Using the Trust’s figures, that would equate to about 575 additional persons on the site, of whom the Trust says 38.5% would be new to its area, or 221 persons. That figure of 221 may be compared to the 1 million persons already living within its catchment (about 0.02%). Mr. Lock KC and Mr. Kolinsky KC, who appeared for HDC, pointed out that the single payment lump sought, £914,000, represents about 0.07% of the most recent figure for the Trust’s turnover, £1.28 billion. </p>

Regulation 122 made the application of those tests, including the necessity test in sub para. (a), a legal requirement, rather than a policy requirement as had previously been the case (<span style="font-style:italic">R (Working Title Films Limited) v Westminster City Council</span> [2017] JPL 173 at [20]; <span style="font-style:italic">Good Energy Generation Limited v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government</span> [2018] JPL 1248 at [71]-[72] and [75]). The application of each of those tests is a matter of evaluative judgment for the local planning authority, subject only to judicial review applying the <span style="font-style:italic">Wednesbury</span> standard (see e.g. <span style="font-style:italic">Smyth v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government</span> [2015] PTSR 1417 at [118]; <span style="font-style:italic">Working Title Films </span>at [25]). Although the application of the three tests in reg.122(2) is a matter of judgment for the decision-maker, the interpretation of the language used in para.(2) is a matter of law for the court. The Trust alleges under ground 3 that HDC misinterpreted reg.122(2)(a). I will deal with that point below.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is helpful at this point to put into context the basis upon which the Trust has sought to advance its legal arguments under ground 3. The Trust has contended that it was irrelevant for HDC to take into account its funding arrangements, because they do not relate to the development or the use of land or to the development of the site.  Accordingly, whether the claimant could itself “mitigate” harm resulting from the development was legally irrelevant. If the availability of alternative funding arrangements were to be material, a body with tax raising or borrowing powers would be unable to obtain a contribution from a developer under s.106 of the TCPA 1990. </p>

However, given the way in which the claimant’s submissions proceeded, it was unnecessary to seek that assistance. Indeed, those sweeping contentions initially made by the Trust are inconsistent with the concession recorded in [14] above.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">No authority was cited in the claimant’s skeleton or in the Statement of Facts and Grounds to support the broad argument initially advanced under ground 3. Nevertheless, it appeared from the correspondence between the Trust and HDC during 2020 and 2021 that the claimant has been relying upon a passage from the speech of Lord Hoffmann in <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco Stores Limited v Secretary of State for the Environment</span> [1995] 1 WLR 759 at 776G to 777A. It emphasised that passage repeatedly in its representations to HDC.  When he opened the case I understood Mr. Cairnes KC to adopt that passage as part of his argument, although he very fairly said that he was not aware of it being applied in any subsequent authority. He also said that the claimant was not relying upon any other authority to support ground 3 specifically. That same passage from the speech of Lord Hoffmann was also relied upon in opinions provided by counsel in 2008, 2015 and 2016 to other NHS Trusts. It has formed part of the underpinning for much of the argument which has been taking place in planning appeals on contributions of the kind sought by the claimant in the present case. Although the Trust’s position is now as set out in [14] above, the potential ramifications of the arguments which have previously been raised make it necessary to address Lord Hoffmann’s dictum.</p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.18in;text-indent:-0.18in">“The government policy of encouraging such agreements has been buttressed by amendments to the planning and highways legislation to confer upon local planning authorities and highway authorities very wide powers to enter into agreements with developers. The new section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 says in express terms that agreements under that section may require a developer to pay sums of money. The new section 278 of the Highways Act 1980, substituted by section 23 of the new Roads and Street Works Act 1991, confers a broad power upon a highway authority to enter into agreements by which some other person will pay for the construction or improvement of roads or streets. Parliament has therefore encouraged local planning authorities to enter into agreements by which developers will pay for <span style="font-style:italic">infrastructure and other facilities</span> which would otherwise have to be provided at the public expense. These policies reflect a shift in Government attitudes to the respective responsibilities of the public and private sectors.

The narrow questions before the House of Lords were (1) whether the Secretary of State had wrongly treated the offer as legally irrelevant and (2) if not, whether his judgment on a matter of weight was open to challenge.

It is also necessary to bear in mind that the Trust raises no legal objection to the fact that the development of the site will not contribute to the ongoing costs of treating “new” residents on the site beyond their first year of occupation. Those costs will be borne by the public purse. On analysis, therefore, this challenge is concerned essentially with the way in which HDC handled the material that was presented to it by the Trust and the application of the tests in reg.122 of the CIL Regulations, particularly the necessity test.</p>

At [57] he stated that it is well-established that a local planning authority may achieve, by obtaining the <span style="font-style:italic">agreement</span> of landowner to a planning obligation, a purpose which it could not achieve by imposing a planning condition. At [59] <span style="font-style:italic">et seq </span>he then identified two constraints on the use of planning obligations in the determination of an application for planning permission. First, a planning obligation which has nothing to do with a proposed development is irrelevant to that decision ([60] – [61]). Second, Parliament has imposed limitations on the use of planning obligations in the determination of planning applications through reg.122 of the CIL Regulations ([62]). However, in the <span style="font-style:italic">DB Symmetry </span>case the parties agreed that the dedication of an access road as a public highway would have satisfied the tests in reg.122.

The preceding document which dealt with the allocation of funding to CCGs, and concerned the 5-year period 2019/20 to 2023/4, was published in May 2019. The starting point for determining the population base was GP registrations as at October 2021. GP registrations in October 2021 were projected forward for each year from 2022/3 through to 2024/5, using the ONS 2018-based Sub-National Population Projections published at the level of Local Authority Districts. Weights were applied to these figures to reflect a range of differences across the country, including ages of the population, variations in health and deprivation, and higher costs of delivery of services in some parts of the country. It is common ground that this method (i) did not take into account persons residing in an area but not registered with GPs and (ii) relied upon the ONS projections for population figures for subsequent years rather than updated GP registrations. The earlier document published in May 2019 used GP registrations average over the 12 months to October 2018 and population projections in the ONS 2016-based projections. </p>

The East Midlands is projected to be the fastest-growing region in England with a projected increase in population of 7% between 2018 and 2028. For North West Leicestershire the increase is 15.9%. The document explains that the factors contributing to changes in population, whether positive or negative, are firstly, “natural change”, the difference between births and deaths and secondly, net migration (page 9). That second factor includes movements between different local authority areas. Population projections may be used to inform planning and the making of policy at a local level. That <span style="font-style:italic">may </span>include planning development to accommodate such movements of population.

Mr Lock KC relied on Rule 2 in Chapter 3 of that NT to support the proposition that this is a requirement rather than a mere ability. Rule 2 states that the provider and the commissioner must agree “the <span style="font-style:italic">expected</span> level of elective activity for the payment period ….” (emphasis added). Mr. Lock KC also pointed to Rule 1(c) which states that “rule 2 and the aligned payment and incentive specified in that rule applies to all secondary care services where … (i) the commissioner and provider have an expected annual contract value of £10 million or more”.

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr. Cairnes KC submitted that rule 2 of the NT does not apply because the Trust does not have “an aligned payment and incentive version of a block contract” and therefore does not fall within Chapter 3 of the NT. He submitted that the block contract is instead subject to the rules in section 4.2 by virtue of para. 44 of the NT. Those rules do not contain any <span style="font-style:italic">requirement</span> of the kind set out in rule 2d of Chapter 3. He said that the Trust had operated a “blended” arrangement with the CCGs, blended in the sense that the contract was part PbR and part block contract, but the Trust had moved from that blended arrangement to an arrangement which was <span style="font-style:italic">entirely</span> a block contract. He said that Chapter 3 of the NT only applies to blended contracts. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note two things. First, para. 42 of the NT says that “the aligned payment and incentive approach is <span style="font-style:italic">based</span> on the blended payment model introduced in the 2019/20 tariff” and that a “blended payment approach remains the direction of travel for the NHS payment systems” (emphasis added). Somewhat confusingly, the equivalent paragraph in the NT for 2022/3 (para. 43) states that “the aligned payment and incentive <span style="font-style:italic">is</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">a type of blended payment</span> based on the model introduced in the 2019/20 tariff” (emphasis added). Second, Rule 4 in Chapter 3 also appears to define the interface between contracts falling within Chapter 3 and contracts falling within Chapter 4 by reference to a contract value of £10 million (see also para. 45 of Chapter 4). These points would tend to support Mr. Lock’s submission.</p>

The NT rules are sadly lacking in clarity. The court is left in this position. “Block contract” is not defined or explained in the NT shown to the court. The term is not even used. Likewise the NT does not define “aligned payment and incentives” or a “blended” arrangement, nor does it relate these expressions to “block contracts”.</p>

That conflicts with the statement made by Mr Cairnes KC (see [68] above) and so only adds to the confused position presented to the court.</p>

              <p class="Quote">“I can confirm that the Government Guidance and contracting rules do not take into consideration how many potential houses are going to be built in accordance with the local plan or existing planning permissions. Moreover, the claimant Trust is required to take the relevant Government Guidance of funding models into account and is not required to adapt its funding model to suit the development plans or policies of the local planning authority. Indeed, were it to do so it would be rightly criticised for not following the correct and appropriate guidance in respect thereof.”</p>

HDC does not contend that the guidance or rules do, or should, take into account development plan policies. Instead, the focus is on the extent to which population growth (which may include growth accommodated in new development) is, or can be, taken into account according to those documents. In any event, broad assertion is no substitute for accurate citation or analysis of the rules themselves. The same applies to para. 10 of the witness statement. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Fortunately, it is unnecessary for me to resolve the issue on how the NT is to be interpreted and applied. HDC’s case does not depend upon being able to show that Rule 2d in Chapter 3 of the NT applied to the Trust’s arrangements. Its alternative position was that the NT Rules (and the Model Contract) do not preclude the CCGs and the Trust from negotiating a block contract which has regard to population growth, or to additional activity resulting from first year occupancy of new development, when negotiating a block contract for the next financial year. Mr. Cairnes KC accepted that that is correct. </p>

Second, what is meant by “not within the NT” is not explained, nor is any source cited. Third, the Technical Guidance for the allotment of funds by NHS England to CCGs allows for some population growth within a financial year.

It was subsequently clarified that this did not mean that additional patients could not be treated, but rather that the consequence of additional activity would be an increase in waiting times and a decline in quality of service. Paragraph 19 explained that a maximum bed occupancy rate of 85% is used to maintain standards of care. Higher occupancy rates can adversely affect the quality of service provided and the ability of the Trust to place a patient in the right type of bed. Information was provided on the extent to which the 85% factor has been and is being exceeded.</p>

There then followed an explanation of the Trust’s “Impact Assessment Formula” [“IAF”] to arrive at the requested contribution, then said to be £914,452. This assumed that the 2,750 dwellings would accommodate 7,520 people, of whom 38.5% or 2,896 people would be new to the Trust’s area. It was estimated in Appendix 3 that these new persons would give rise to an additional 4,164 acute interventions split between specified types of treatment.

The Trust will not receive the full funding required to meet the healthcare demand due to the baseline rules on emergency funding  and  there  is  no  mechanism  for  the  Trust  to  recover  these  costs retrospectively  in  subsequent  years  as  explained.  Without securing  such  contributions,  the Trust would be unable to support the proposals and would object to the application because of the direct and adverse impact of it on the delivery of health care in the Trust’s area. Therefore the contribution required for  this  proposed  development  of  2,750  dwellings  is  £914,452.00. This contribution will be used directly to provide additional health care services to meet patient demand as detailed in Appendix 3.</p>

This impact is similar that it creates on education, highways, libraries and on the additional staff costs for the Council’s own monitoring officer. The impact is potentially long term as it affects the Trust’s ability to provide services at the safe level required as explained.  The issue is how to mitigate the impact? The Developer should not be paying something that has already been paid for. The Trust has provided careful calculation methodology as required by CIL regulation. The Trust does not get paid for the additional new population creating the impact on the services as explained. The calculation methodology explains the lack of funding created by the new population. If the developer contributes towards the financial gap in the funding then the impact is mitigated. The Trust could mitigate the impact in various ways but the Trust considers that this is modest but very effective way of dealing with the direct impact as the mitigation model will take the immediate impact away as explained below.</p>

As explained the Trust is only seeking the element over and above the standard staffing costs that is created by having to hire locums. (Please see the Spring Lane Appeal decision)</p>

Under the CIL regulations the first test is to establish that the funding is necessary in that it serves a planning purpose and it is needed to enable the development to go ahead. The planning purpose would be to ensure the provision of adequate health care and treatment. In this case the matter seems to be about delay in patients receiving treatment. Given that the overall funding of the NHS is through national taxation, the difficulty in treating patients would appear to be a contractual issue which itself appears to be a national one. </p>

The first is does the funding serve a substantial planning purpose or does the impact arise because of other matters. To this end it is necessary to examine the funding mechanism. <span style="font-style:italic">As has been set out previously UHL is funded through a block grant negotiated annually based on the previous year’s activity. What is unclear is why the negotiation of the block grant cannot take into account an element for growth in population or household numbers. There are a number of sources of information about planned growth and consultation with local authorities could identify any unplanned growth. The second matter is the speed of occupation of any new dwellings. From the grant of planning permission to the occupation of any dwellings there is a time lag and during this period it is clear how many dwellings would be occupied and potentially how many new residents there would be. This would appear to give an opportunity to negotiate a contract which reflects this known growth. It is not clear from the evidence submitted by UHL why the CCG block contract cannot be adjusted to take into account the anticipated growth of an area.</span></p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.79in">6.33 The initial question is whether the UHL requested contribution serves a planning purpose and is necessary. UHL have identified a gap in its funding due to the way in which the block grant forward funding operates which does not appear to take into account population growth attributable to new housing developments and a subsequent increase in demand until the year following the impact. It seems that this is a systemic problem given that the identification of growth underlies the Health and Well Being Strategy and there is information available on planned and actual growth readily available. While it is said that the planning purpose of the requested contribution is to ensure adequate health care and treatment, the issue is not whether a person will be treated or not, but the effect on the quality of the service in terms of delay. However, given that NHS treatment is intended to be provided from national taxation, what is being said in substance is that the planning system/developers should subsidise UHL for the effects of the operation of NHS’s funding mechanisms. </p>

Where infrastructure is involved, it can be scaled to meet the requirements of a given new population by reference to a robust methodology. Where revenue funding is involved, in this case staff, it is more difficult to attribute their time to patients arising from the development or to ensure that the monies are directed at services which will meet the actual healthcare needs of the new population as opposed to being subsumed in general budgets. This is key to the directly related and fairly and reasonably related in scale and kind tests of regulation 122. In its submission of 20 April UHL undertook to demonstrate how funding would be accounted for. UHL have set out the following.  The monies are used to service the additional population from this development. Each patient creates an activity which has a tariff. The total costs of the activity includes among other things pathology tests, drugs, imaging, endoscopy, critical care, blood and operating theatres. The Trust is happy to provide an undertaking that the contribution is used as requested and the breaking it down as explained above i.e. towards the extra activity created by the new population of the development.

On the first test in reg. 122(2), officers advised that because of the time lag between the grant of any permission and the first occupation of any dwellings there was an opportunity for the CCGs and the Trust to address their funding arrangements so that there would not be a reduction in the standard of care. NHS funding and health service planning at a local level appeared to take account of population growth and it had not been shown to HDC why NHS funding would not respond appropriately to it. If there was a funding gap as alleged by the Trust, for example, because of a time lag between the “new residents” occupying dwellings and NHS funds becoming available, that was a problem in the system of funding (paras. 6.57 to 6.59). It is necessary to note that that last statement assumed that there would be such a gap. One of the problems throughout the protracted consideration of the Trust’s request for a financial contribution under s.106 was that the Trust failed to show that the annual negotiations of a new block contract do not, and could not, address the issue of population growth satisfactorily, albeit that the commissioning bodies were receiving some funding for such growth.</p>

A similar point was made in para. 6.30. The Trust submits that healthcare services, including the treatment of ill health, are firmly within the ambit of the national policies referred to above. The Trust criticises the approach taken in the officers’ report because it resulted in HDC <span style="font-style:italic">excluding </span>the health impacts of the development in relation to the services provided by the Trust.

Paragraph 6.30 simply makes the point that the emphasis of the matters summarised in para. 6.29 is the provision of facilities rather than the treatment of illness. It did not purport to exclude health treatment as a material consideration. Read fairly and as a whole, the same is also true of para. 6.28 of the officers’ report.</p>

Elsewhere in their report the officers said that it is more difficult to relate the use of a financial contribution for the provision of services to the effects of a development, as compared with a need for infrastructure. That was a judgment on a matter of fact and degree. That is consistent with Mr. Kolinsky’s acceptance that there is no hard-edged distinction between the two. The officers’ report did not proceed on the basis that contributions to the provision of services should not be considered. </p>

The Trust says that that was not a material planning factor because it does not relate to the development or use of land, nor does it relate to the development for which planning permission was granted. Whether the Trust could itself “mitigate the harm it would suffer because of the development” was irrelevant. Instead, the decision HDC had to make “was about [LCC] and whether it could or should be obliged to mitigate the negative effects of the proposed development to make it acceptable”.

On any fair reading of the officers’ reports and the correspondence, that second matter was a freestanding concern which was in no way dependent upon, or affected by, the questions raised by HDC in relation to the possibility of the Trust switching to PbR. The claimant failed to satisfy HDC on that second issue in any event. Accordingly, any complaint about the PbR issue could not possibly provide a basis for the court to intervene.</p>

That is why the Trust sought a financial contribution rather than, for example, an obligation on the developer to provide infrastructure or some other physical form of mitigation. If there were to be no funding gap resulting in that harm there would be no relevant impacts to justify a s.106 contribution (see [14] above). It is the very nature of the harm claimed by the Trust which makes the alleged funding gap an integral part of its case.

There is no funding issue because it is common ground that such persons are taken into account in the funding for CCGs and in the relevant block contract payments to the Trust. Rightly, the Trust does not seek any s.106 contribution for such costs. In such circumstances a local planning authority could not properly require the owner or developer of the site to pay for those additional costs. A s.106 obligation to that effect would not be necessary to make the development acceptable (reg.122(2)(a) of the CIL Regulations 2010) and could not properly be taken into account in the decision on whether or not to grant planning permission.  If, however, planning permission were to be granted on that basis, it would be liable to be quashed. In effect, the developer would be paying for a community benefit, increasing the funding of the NHS, which had no proper planning purpose or relationship to the development (see <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Wright</span>).</p>

Those were matters of judgment for HDC and the claimant has not shown any public law error in that respect. Indeed, it was a perfectly rational and unsurprising judgment for the authority to have made. That is sufficient to dispose of ground 3.

This is misconceived. The Trust does not have the power to raise taxes and  HDC’s approach did not assume that the Trust should borrow additional monies or that some other public authority should raise additional taxes. Instead, HDC was concerned to understand whether the costs identified by the Trust could be met having regard to the funding available to CCGs. That simply flowed from the very nature of the planning obligation which the Trust sought, namely a financial contribution to fill a funding gap. But where, for example, a development would itself cause direct harm to a public facility, so that the three tests in reg.122(2) of the CIL Regulations 2010 are satisfied, the local planning authority would be entitled to require the developer to mitigate that harm under a s.106 obligation, irrespective of whether the authority responsible for that facility is able to raise taxes or has borrowing powers.</p>

The contribution would relate to people who are new to the Trust’s area. But those people are entitled to such services wherever they may live in the country. They would be so entitled if the development were to be refused planning permission and so they did not move to the Trust’s area. The relevant CCG for the area in which they live would remain under a statutory duty to arrange for the provision of the same treatment as would otherwise be provided by the Trust. The obligation to provide, and financial responsibility for, those services lies with the NHS. The context is far removed from the analogy of a typical s.106 obligation given by Mr Cairnes KC, namely where a developer is required to mitigate a reduction in the performance of a local highway network that would be caused by a new development. There, the highway authority is not under a statutory duty to fund improvements to the network, let alone to provide for highway facilities made necessary by a specific development.</p>

So it has not been suggested that the development would increase the burden on the NHS in England as a whole. The attempt by the Trust to obtain a financial contribution under s.106 therefore depends upon their demonstrating a <span style="font-style:italic">localised</span> harm. The only harm they seek to rely upon concerns the provision by the Trust of services commissioned by the CCGs. On the Trust’s own case, that has to depend upon them showing a funding gap in relation to treatments for residents new to the area during their first year. The Trust accepts that there is no justification for any payment relating to other “first year” residents who are simply moving home within the Trust’s area, or to any resident after their first year at East Lutterworth. The extent to which funding is available to the Trust for the services it provides to the CCGs is the only possible justification for drawing these distinctions.

The Trust’s complaint simply overlooks the fact that its own case was based upon an assertion that there was a funding gap that could not be overcome.

By that stage HDC had taken advice from leading counsel specialising in NHS law to assist its understanding of NHS funding and the Trust had failed over a long period to explain why the annual review of block contract payments could not satisfactorily address the funding issue raised by the Trust. </p>

First, in an area of net in-migration any increase in the need for treatment and staff will be experienced in the relevant local area, not nationally. Second, because the patients would receive treatment even if they had not moved home, a local funding gap would only arise if funding for the relevant NHS trust did not adequately reflect a projected increase in population and/or the national funding system did not adequately provide for a timely redistribution of resources. Population projections will involve some areas of out-migration as well as areas of net in-migration. It is therefore significant that CCG funding across the country takes into account ONS population projections.

If there really is a systemic problem, this may raise the question in other cases whether it is appropriate to require individual development sites across the country to make s.106 contributions to address that problem.  However, for the purposes of dealing with the present challenge, HDC’s decision rested on the Trust’s failure to show that there was a funding gap in this case, not any systemic issue. </p>

As para. 70 of the Trust’s skeleton puts it, ground 2 “addresses the impacts upon the finances of the claimant.” Paragraph 70(c) and (d) states “the impact upon the claimant’s finances relates to the character or use of land because it arises directly from the development…” “The claimant cannot avoid the impacts.” Paragraph 70(e) states that HDC was “obliged to consider the financial impacts on the claimant. This was because they were so obviously material that not to take them into account was irrational.”</p>

Points (i) and (ii) assume that there would be a financial impact on the Trust because of a funding gap to cover the costs of treating new residents during their first year of occupation. What the Trust repeatedly failed to explain in its representations to HDC was why the annual negotiations for a block contract for the next financial year do not, or could not, take into account population growth during that year, given that CCG funding has an element for future population growth. HDC’s position was made clearly enough in, for example, paras. 6.32 to 6.34 of the officers’ report to the meeting on 28 July 2020 and in the Supplementary Information given to the Committee (see [111] above). </p>

The Trust then went on to assert that “only a very small element of growth in population is allocated to CCG”. That assertion does not sit very well with the ONS material which both sides showed to the court. But leaving that point to one side, the Trust failed to deal with an obviously important point. They did not explain how much population growth was allowed for in the funding provided to the CCGs and then to the Trust, and how that compared, for example, to up to 220 “new” persons that might be expected to start living at East Lutterworth in any year, or to any other annual population estimate from HDC based on its housing trajectory. That would be directly and obviously relevant to whether there was a funding shortfall at all, and if so how much. </p>

Certainly, it is not the way the Trust has argued its case here. Ultimately, such a decision letter was of no real use to a decision-maker dealing with the financial issues in the present case without being told by the Trust what relevant materials the Planning Inspector had been given, in particular dealing with the legal, policy and contractual aspects of funding.

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">The letter from the Trust’s Solicitors complained about a number of alleged errors in the officers’ report to committee. None of those points is capable of supporting a <span style="font-style:italic">Kides</span> challenge. I have already rejected several of the criticisms. Several are not even new points. For example, the absence of <span style="font-style:italic">retrospective </span>funding to cover “first year” treatment had been addressed in the officers’ report (see e.g. para. 4.2.49). More pertinently, the points made by the Trust assume that a funding gap, or deficit, exists in the first place. The very fact that the Trust repeated this same point in purporting to address HDC’s concern that the gap had not been adequately explained and demonstrated, only serves to show that the Trust was still refusing or failing to deal with that issue. The Trust’s assertion in relation to para. 6.58 of the officers’ report that ONS projections only take into account natural growth is simply wrong. The projections take into account net in-migration which is relevant to the need for new development. What the Trust continually failed to do was to explain how much population growth (and of what kind) was (or could be) allowed for in the funding of the CCGs and in arriving at a new block contract each year, applying NHS rules. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">HDC made clear in, for example, its letters dated 16 November 2020 and 10 August 2021 that the Trust had not addressed the population growth issue in the context of annual renegotiations of the block contract, taking into account the methodology of ONS projections. The reply from the Trust dated 24 September 2021 failed to deal with that central point. For example, it referred again to the passage in <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco </span>at [1995] 1 WLR 776G to 777A and said that “the tenet” of HDC’s most recent letter “misses the point completely; the way the Trust is funded is irrelevant”. Fortified by that misconception of the law, the letter mainly comprised a recycling of points made several times before. Reference was made once again to the use of “historical population” figures based on GP registrations, demographic weighting factors, and the use of ONS data. But no further explanation was offered on the treatment of population growth. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">By now HDC would have been entitled to regard this protracted, unhelpful process as exasperating. The letter from HDC’s Chief Executive of 9 December 2021 was reasonable and is unsurprising. HDC’s officers were entitled to point to the net in-migration population forecasts produced by ONS and to conclude that the Trust had not made out its case that there would be a funding gap under the arrangements for a block contract. Given the failure, or unwillingness, of the Trust to engage with that issue over such a long period of time, it is not surprising that the Chief Executive expressed confidence that there was no problem. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">If any ground of challenge had been made out, HDC and LCC invited the court to reject the claim on the grounds of delay, by treating the letter from HDC dated 9 December 2021 as the effective decision, rather than the issuing of the decision notice on 17 May 2022. Counsel recognised that this would involve creating an exception to the principle laid down by the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">R (Burkett) v Hammersmith and Fulham London Borough Council</span> [2002] 1 WLR 1593. The justification for, and extent of, any such exception would be closely related and would require full argument. In the absence of such argument it would be inappropriate for this court to consider the point. In any event, because I have rejected each of the grounds of challenge, there is no need to do so. </p>
