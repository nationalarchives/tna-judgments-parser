              <p class="Normal2" style="margin-left:0.39in">Does section 249A of the Housing Act 2004, allow a financial penalty to be imposed on each of two joint landlords for the offence of having control of an unlicensed HMO contrary to section 72(1) of the Act, or may only one penalty be imposed jointly on them both, or none at all?  These questions arise on this appeal from a decision of the First-tier Tribunal (Property Chamber) (the FTT) by which it confirmed separate financial penalties of £10,000 originally imposed on each of the two appellants, Mr Gurmail Gill and Mr Jarnail S Gill, by the respondent, the Royal Borough of Greenwich.</p>

            <content>
              <p class="Normal2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The financial penalties were imposed because the respondent and the FTT were satisfied that the appellants were both persons having control of an HMO at 68 Conway Road, London SE18 which was required to be licensed under Part 2 of the 2004 Act but which was not licensed.  </p>

              <p class="Normal2" style="margin-left:0.39in">68 Conway Road is a small mid-terrace house which at the relevant time was occupied by five elderly people who were unrelated and who shared kitchen and bathroom facilities.  On 1 October 2017 it became subject to an additional licensing scheme introduced by the respondent under Part 2 of the 2004 Act.  </p>

              <p class="Normal2" style="margin-left:0.39in">The appellants are brothers who had inherited the property from their parents in March 2017.  At that time the whole building was let to a single tenant, Mr Pradhan, who was holding over under an expired tenancy granted to him by their father.  The original tenancy had included a prohibition on sub-letting but, as the appellants were aware, Mr Pradhan did not live at the property but instead sub-let it to the five residents.  He paid £1,400 a month to the appellants and collected rents totalling £1,800 a month from his sub-tenants. </p>

There is nothing in the 2004 Act to suggest any contrary intention as far as section 263 is concerned, so in an appropriate case the reference to “person having control” can mean “persons having control” and where a rack rent is received by more than one person the expression “the person” includes them all.</p>

By paragraph 10 of Schedule 13A a person on whom a financial penalty is imposed has a right of appeal to the FTT.  By paragraph 10(3) such an appeal is to be a re-hearing of the local housing authority’s decision. A “re-hearing” means that the FTT is required to decide for itself whether a financial penalty should be imposed and, if so, to decide the amount of that penalty, rather than simply considering whether the authority was entitled to impose the penalty it did.

Each of them was entitled to £700 a month, which was less than two-thirds of the full value of the property.

As Mr Gill pointed out, although <span style="font-style:italic">Cusack-Smith </span>determined that<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>a superior landlord and an immediate landlord could both be in receipt of a rack rent, it did not address the position of joint landlords at the same level.</p>

The flats were let on long leases and the owner of the freehold had covenanted to repair the structure, but it was in receipt of ground rents only and it argued successfully that it was not the person having control of the building because it was not in a position to grant a lease at a rack rent.  Section 39 of the 1957 Act was in the same terms as section 263 of the 2004 Act and included the same two limbs, the first of which applied where the property was let at a rack and the second where it was not so let.  In the latter case the person having control was the person “who would so receive it [the rack rent] if the premises were let at a rack rent”.  <span style="font-style:italic">Pollway</span> was concerned with the second limb of the definition of “person having control”.  </p>

                <p class="Normal2" style="margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">“The argument for the respondent is that the definition is only apt to apply to a person whose interest in the property entitles him to dispose of the right of occupation. It is for the right of occupation that rack rents are paid. Hence the person entitled to grant that right will receive the rack rent if the property is let at a rack rent or would receive it if it were so let. In the case of a house comprising a multiplicity of residential units let on long leases at ground rents, there is either no person to whom the definition can apply or the definition applies collectively to all the long leaseholders who between them either receive the rack rents of units sub-let at rack rents or would receive the rack rents if the units were so sub-let.”</p>

In the commonplace and more straightforward situation where two persons have a joint interest in the whole of the building there is no reason why they should not collectively be persons having control of the house if they are in receipt of the rack rent (or would be if the property were let at a rack rent).</p>

Joint owners of the whole of the building are entitled to receive the whole of the rent of the building, and it is immaterial that the terms on which they hold their joint interests give each of them an entitlement, as against the other, to only a proportion of the total rent.  For that reason, where there are joint landlords, any one of them may give a good receipt for the rent, and on the death of one of them the rent is payable in full to the survivor (see <span style="font-style:italic">Woodfall: Landlord and Tenant, </span>para 7.073).  For the purpose of section 263 both of the appellants were therefore persons entitled to receive the rack rent of the HMO and both were persons having control of it.</p>

The offence under section 72(1) is that of being “a person having control of or managing an HMO which is required to be licensed … but is not so licensed”.  On the findings of the FTT each of the appellants was such a person.  Each was a person having control of the HMO, and each held that status while the HMO was occupied in circumstances which required a licence but where none had been obtained.  The appellants did not jointly commit the offence, they each committed it and each could have been separately prosecuted.  In the same way, each could be the subject of a separate financial penalty because each has committed his own offence.</p>

But this prohibition does not stand in the way of each of two individuals being subject to a separate penalty in respect of separate offences which they have each committed because each penalty is imposed on a different person.  Nor is it possible to say that the conduct in each case was the same: the conduct relevant to each appellant’s liability was his own conduct and not that of his brother, although the things which each of them did or omitted to do was the same.</p>

              <p class="Normal2" style="margin-left:0.39in">When the FTT applied the respondent’s penalty matrix in this case it did not differentiate between the appellants and treated them as equally culpable for the fact that the HMO was not licensed.  But it is important that the penalty imposed on each joint landlord reflects his or her degree of responsibility, and a local authority or FTT should give separate consideration to the conduct of each person on whom a penalty is to be imposed.  There may be cases where one of two joint landlords is responsible for the management of jointly owned property and where the other plays no part.  There may be cases where one joint landlord has a relevant history of similar offences while the other does not. The proper response to cases of that sort will depend on the facts found. What is important is that the responsibilities, actions and circumstances of each landlord are separately assessed.</p>

                <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Any party to this case has a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal on any point of law arising from this decision.  The right of appeal may be exercised only with permission. An application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal must be sent or delivered to the Tribunal so that it is received within 1 month after the date on which this decision is sent to the parties (unless an application for costs is made within 14 days of the decision being sent to the parties, in which case an application for permission to appeal must be made within 1 month of the date on which the Tribunal’s decision on costs is sent to the parties).  An application for permission to appeal must identify the decision of the Tribunal to which it relates, identify the alleged error or errors of law in the decision, and state the result the party making the application is seeking.  If the Tribunal refuses permission to appeal a further application may then be made to the Court of Appeal for permission.</p>
