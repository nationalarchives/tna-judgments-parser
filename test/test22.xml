              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">CIA Insurance Services Limited (“CIAISL”) made contributions to the CIA Insurance Services Limited Remuneration Trust (the “Trust”).  Those contributions were used to make loans to three individuals, Lee Callaby (formerly Lee Martin), Eliot Blundell and Martin Sheppard who were the sole shareholders of CIAISL’s immediate parent company and were also employees of CIAISL (and, in the case of Ms Callaby and Mr Blundell, directors of CIAISL).  Those three individuals are referred to together as the “Shareholders”.  This arrangement of making contributions to a remuneration trust and then those funds being used to make loans is one which had been designed by Paul Baxendale-Walker and entities connected with him and his firm, Baxendale Walker LLP (together referred to as “Baxendale Walker”).  </p>

            <content>
              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">HMRC have issued closure notices and discovery assessments to CIAISL, denying the corporation tax deductions claimed for the contributions to the Trust and fees paid by the company for the accounting periods ended 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2014.  HMRC have also issued determinations under regulation 80 Income Tax (Pay As You Earn) Regulations 2003 (“Regulation 80 Determinations”/ “the PAYE Regulations”) and decisions under s8 Social Security (Transfer of Functions, etc.) Act 1999 (the “Section 8 Decisions”/ “SS(ToF)A 1999”) for the tax years 2011-12 to 2013-14.  CIAISL have appealed against the amendments made by HMRC to their corporation tax returns, the discovery assessments and the determinations and decisions made by HMRC.    </p>

            <content>
              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">CIAISL established the trust and made the first contributions in the accounting period ended 31 December 2010 (in December 2010).  Only the deductions claimed in the accounting periods ended 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2014 are currently before this Tribunal.  The contributions into the Trust from its establishment to 31 December 2014 total £9,655,000.  This sum includes the contributions made in December 2010 – whilst the deductibility of those contributions is not covered by this appeal, they funded loans which are covered by the Regulation 80 Determinations and Section 8 Decisions.</p>

            <content>
              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The issues are described more fully below, but CIAISL’s position is that the contributions were paid wholly and exclusively for the purposes of its trade and that, accordingly, they and the fees paid to Baxendale Walker and related entities are deductible.  They submit that the loans advanced to Shareholders are not taxable.  </p>

            <content>
              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">One issue relevant to the corporation tax treatment has already been stayed, namely whether contributions to the Trust should have been recognised as an expense in CIAISL’s profit and loss account under UK GAAP.  HMRC requested that I reach a decision on liability in principle, following which the parties can seek to agree the correct calculations, and CIAISL have not disagreed with this approach.  I agree that this is the most efficient approach (and the parties are at liberty to apply if they cannot reach an agreement on quantum).</p>

            <content>
              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">For the reasons set out below, CIAISL’s appeals are dismissed (save as regards the income tax and NICs treatment of one purported contribution).  I have concluded that the contributions to the Trust and the fees were not incurred wholly and exclusively for the purposes of CIAISL’s trade and that the loans made to the Shareholders are employment income of the Shareholders.</p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I dealt with various matters by way of case management, and gave my decision on those matters during the hearing.

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Three matters had been the subject of applications made to the Tribunal before the hearing, and I had received written representations from both parties in each instance.  I did hear some oral submissions during the morning of day one of the hearing, but against the background that I had the benefit of full applications which had been made in advance.  The applications made and decisions reached were as follows:</p>

                <p class="Taxbodytext2" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.38in">HMRC had applied on 10 January 2022 to make further amendments to their statement of case, which had previously been amended in January 2019.  CIAISL had agreed some of these amendments in correspondence, and given qualified agreement to other changes.  However, by the time of the hearing CIAISL had further narrowed down the areas of disagreement, and in certain instances indicated that it was prepared to accept further amendments, albeit that Mr Venables was critical of (inter alia) the timing of the application.  Having considered the detailed changes sought to be made by HMRC and the position of CIAISL (both in its initial objections of 2 February 2022, and as put by Mr Venables at the hearing), I decided to allow the amendments to be made.</p>

                <p class="Taxbodytext2" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.38in">HMRC had applied for additional documents to be admitted in addition to those which it had specified in its list of documents.  That application was formally made on 8 March 2022, but had been preceded by various correspondence between the parties.  HMRC had prepared a supplementary bundle of these documents.  CIAISL had objected to these documents being admitted at what it submitted was a very late stage.  Having regard to the facts that the documents were largely those which had been provided to HMRC by CIAISL, HMRC had told CIAISL in 2020 that it would be seeking to include many of these documents in the bundle, and most of the additional documents were contained in a supplementary bundle which had been provided to CIAISL in January 2022, I considered it was in accordance with the overriding objective to admit the documents.</p>

                <p class="Taxbodytext2" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.38in">CIAISL applied on 8 March 2022 for evidence in relation to what was termed “Type A insurance” to be heard in private, and for any reference to such insurance in my decision to be referred to similarly, on the basis that some of the evidence was commercially sensitive.  The sensitivity was explained as resulting from the combination of the identification of the type of business and the evidence as to CIAISL’s business model.  There was no application for the hearing to be conducted entirely in private, or for the decision to be anonymised.  HMRC objected, and its reasons included that the type of business was not secret and they did not consider it constitutes sensitive information for these purposes.  I decided, taking account of the evidence in the witness statements of Ms Callaby, that I was satisfied that restricting access to part of the hearing, namely the evidence of Ms Callaby, was justified to maintain the confidentiality of sensitive information (within rule 32(2)(c) of the Tribunal Rules) and that my decision should not disclose information which was referred to only in the part of the hearing that was held in private (in accordance with rule 32(6)).</p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">These submissions, which I refer to generally as the Trust Arguments, took various forms and were posed in differing ways throughout the hearing (and when setting out his detailed submissions, after Ms Callaby’s evidence had completed, Mr Venables expanded this to include a challenge as to the capacity in which moneys were received by Baxendale Walker).  One iteration only operated as an alternative submission (as it was effectively a concession of the appeal against the assessments, as there can be no deduction for expenses not incurred), but all had in common that they were raised to defeat HMRC’s arguments on the Regulation 80 Determinations and the Section 8 Decisions.  CIAISL was thus seeking to introduce a new ground of appeal during the course of the hearing itself.  I asked for representations as to whether this new ground should be admitted.  Mr Venables explained that the Trust Arguments had arisen at a late stage as they were preparing for the hearing.  </p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I took time to consider the matter overnight.  At the beginning of day four I informed the parties that I would give permission for CIAISL to run the Trust Arguments.  I agreed with Mr Ghosh that the Trust Arguments were being raised extraordinarily late – not only had they not been set out in any of the written submissions, but also they had not even been identified on day one of the hearing.  The timing weighed heavily against allowing the Trust Arguments to be made.  However, my reasons for allowing the Trust Arguments were based on the interests of justice suggesting that new arguments should be heard, particularly where they were based on law and should not require significant additional factual evidence; moreover, and particularly significant in the context of this appeal, HMRC had reserved their position on sham throughout (having done so in their various statements of case) and had been directed (by me prior to the commencement of the hearing) that they would need to set out their position on sham following conclusion of the witness evidence.  I considered that if HMRC did decide to pursue an argument that some or all of the documents were a sham (a matter which would not be known until around day six), then all or part of the Trust Arguments might be expected to be raised as a response to such a position and it would be unfair to CIAISL to refuse to allow them at that stage to make such arguments by way of a response to HMRC.  I considered it would be inefficient and make preparation even more difficult if I were to defer making a decision on the Trust Arguments until HMRC’s position on sham was known, and I did note that CIAISL had alluded in their skeleton argument to an argument being made that no relevant step was taken by any relevant third person (albeit with no further information by way of explanation).  Whilst the position was finely balanced, I thus decided to give permission.</p>

They are findings that those documents on those terms were entered into and that the payment flows occurred; they do not address at this stage the submissions of Mr Venables in relation to the validity of the acts involved (ie the Trust Arguments), including the submissions there was no “payment” for relevant purposes.

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">HMRC’s skeleton argument included a schedule setting out the details of the resolutions of CIAISL to make contributions to the Trust and subsequent steps that occurred in relation thereto.  That schedule, as produced, included references to relevant pages of the bundles which were the source of the information included therein.  In the light of all of the evidence before me, I am satisfied that such schedule is an accurate record of the payments that were made by CIAISL in connection with the Trust arrangement from 6 December 2010 to 31 December 2014.  The substance of that document is set out as the Schedule hereto and I find as a fact that the information recorded therein is accurate, ie that the resolutions were made by CIAISL, payments were made, letters were sent and loan agreements were entered into as set out therein.</p>

The JHL Loan was for the amount of £350,000, with a repayment date of 16 December 2010.

The Request Letter of 29 November 2011 is expressed slightly differently from those sent previously.  It is still framed as a request, and reaffirms the Shareholders’ understanding that BTIL is not bound to follow their wishes, but is headed “Re. CIA Insurance Services Ltd Remuneration Trust (“the Scheme”)” and starts “As the founder of the Trust, I am writing to request…”.  It then requests the transfer of £200,000 of trust assets “to be managed by the FIDCO, MEL Management Services Limited upon commercial terms to be agreed, for the purposes of general Investment”.  There is no reference in this form of letter to the money being held in the Baxendale Walker client account.  </p>

However, there were no bank statements available for MEL from May 2014 onwards.  I find that the amounts transferred by CIAISL to Baxendale Walker were transferred to MEL (relying on this being the pattern of earlier transactions, this was in accordance with available Request Letters and Ms Callaby not having given evidence to the contrary) and that MEL lent this money to the Shareholders in accordance with the Finance Agreements which it entered into (which were before me).</p>

                <p class="Taxbodytext2" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.38in">CIAISL had been incorporated in December 2001 and initially its business was a combination of motorcycle and car insurance risks.  It had particular expertise in the motorcycle insurance business and this grew significantly.  Until around 2006 this was seen as a niche business – there were a small number of insurance intermediaries who specialised in this area and CIAISL was one of them.  They had access to competitive underwriting rates, and designed an insurance solution with Honda and Virgin.  They had access to a small pool of money which allowed CIAISL to “soften” the rates it offered to potential customers.  The motorcycle business was very price sensitive – a very small difference in premium would be enough to win the business.</p>

                <p class="Taxbodytext2" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.38in">By January 2006 the motorcycle business accounted for about 85% of CIAISL’s turnover.  Margins were small but there was a high turnover.  However, other bigger players joined this market.  CIAISL’s usual underwriters no longer appeared competitive.  They discovered that one particular competitor was cornering the market – it had a deal with overseas underwriters and had a large cash fighting fund.  A cash fighting fund is important as when premiums increase, CIAISL can allocate a discount from the fighting fund to offer a lower price to customers.</p>

The statement is made after the witness's memory has been “refreshed” by reading documents.

Sometimes she explained this by reference to the events in question having been a long time ago.  I accept that would be a reasonable explanation for, eg, not remembering the making of specific resolutions, or points of detail about the timing of sending particular Request Letters to BTIL.  However, this was less understandable when she was not able to explain, eg, why the Shareholders had lent more than £220,000 to CIAISL from the first contribution (when the company had only just resolved to pay that amount to the Trust) or why the JHL Loan had passed through CIAISL to MEL to LEM and back to CIAISL, or how the loans totalling £350,000 from MEL to the Shareholders were to be funded given that the relevant Finance Agreements were dated 16 December 2010 and CIAISL had already instructed Lloyds that the funds were to be transferred from MEL to LEM.  These were transactions involving very large sums of money, the companies of which she was a director and contracts to which she was a party personally.</p>

This was notable in the context of the questions relating to the advice which had been taken by CIAISL.  Her witness statements set out that the idea of entering into the trust arrangements was suggested by TGFP, CIAISL’s accountant and auditor.  The bundle included an engagement letter from Baxendale Walker, setting out various matters including the scope of advice and fees payable.  CIAISL had entered into an array of documentation.  Yet Ms Callaby provided very little explanation as to how this had all come about.  She was reluctant to confirm that the company had taken advice.  Whilst Mr Venables’ submissions included that I may well conclude that CIAISL had wrongly placed their trust in advisers who produced poor documents, in fact Ms Callaby did not give evidence that they had relied on advisers.  She briefly referred to the trust enabling them to have a fighting fund, but did not explain how CIAISL had been told this would operate in any detail.  Overall, I considered that there was a lack of candour in her responses to some questions.  This does raise an issue as to the credibility of her evidence.</p>

                <p class="Taxbodytext2" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.38in">This was reinforced by some of her answers being contradicted by other evidence.  A notable example was in relation to the Questionnaire.  As set out under Facts, this Questionnaire was referred to in CIAISL’s resolution of 6 December 2010 to establish the trust arrangement.  Her evidence was that the answers given were CIAISL’s own answers.  She was told (by Mr Ghosh) that they were materially identical to answers given by other users of corporate remuneration trusts promoted by Baxendale Walker (and Mr Ghosh offered to take her to published decisions recording such answers) and her only explanation was that it was a long time since she had seen the Questionnaire.  When she was unable to explain the meaning of answers recorded in the Questionnaire, she still maintained that these were CIAISL’s answers.  Mr Ghosh put it to her that the company wrote what someone had told them to for these answers, and she said she wouldn’t be able to comment.  I have no doubt in finding that the answers to the Questionnaire were provided to them (from Baxendale Walker, potentially through TGFP as there was insufficient evidence as to any direct contract between Baxendale Walker and CIAISL), and were not prepared by the directors of CIAISL.  I find that Ms Callaby knew this.  Her refusal to explain how the documentation had been prepared, and her initial insistence that these were CIAISL’s answers (despite her not understanding what they meant when she was one of just two directors at all relevant times) left me concerned that her evidence was not candid and truthful.  </p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Overall, my conclusion was that Ms Callaby was not a credible or reliable witness.  It was notable that, despite Mr Venables having carefully set out in his detailed opening submissions the scenario of poorly drafted documents which were difficult to understand, use of standard forms which did not accurately reflect CIAISL’s own position, and a misplaced reliance on advisers, this was not supported by the evidence she gave.  She refused to acknowledge that the resolutions were in the same form, that they had been provided to them by their advisers, and was reluctant to confirm that tax advice had been taken at all.  I do not consider that my concerns can be explained by reference to the fallibility of human memory, even bearing in mind that it is now more than ten years since the Trust was established.  Instead, I place little weight on Ms Callaby’s evidence where it is unsupported by documentary evidence or inferences from other facts.  This is significant in the context of my consideration of CIAISL’s purposes in making the contributions and whether the loans were connected with the Shareholders’ employment by CIAISL or remuneration for such employment.</p>

The question does not involve an inquiry of the taxpayer whether he consciously intended to obtain a trade or personal advantage by the payment. The primary inquiry is to ascertain what was the particular object of the taxpayer in making the payment. Once that is ascertained, its characterisation as a trade or private purpose is in my opinion a matter for the Commissioners, not for the taxpayer. Thus in <span style="font-style:italic">Mallalieu v Drummond</span> the primary question was not whether Miss Mallalieu intended her expenditure on clothes to serve exclusively a professional purpose or partly a professional and partly a private purpose; but whether it was intended not only to enable her to comply with the requirements of the Bar Council when appearing as a barrister in Court but also to preserve warmth and decency.”</p>

He went on to state that where the taxpayer’s chosen course is seen upon examination to involve tax avoidance (as opposed to tax mitigation) it follows that tax avoidance must be at least one of the taxpayer’s purposes in adopting that course, whether or not the taxpayer has formed the subjective motive of avoiding tax.</p>

There was no evidence of decisions being taken by MEL which could have the potential (even if theoretical) to disrupt this chain of events.  MEL did enter into the Finance Agreements but there was no evidence of any consideration of the decision to enter into such agreements.</p>

There was no direct evidence as to what that advice was; and Ms Callaby did not offer any evidence as to how CIAISL had engaged with Baxendale Walker.  I infer that they were introduced to CIAISL by TGFP.  There was other evidence that CIAISL had taken some tax advice (placing no weight for this purpose on the answer to the Questionnaire which said they had taken independent professional advice, as I am not satisfied that this was CIAISL’s own answer) – in the accounts of CIAISL for the year ended 31 December 2010 the contributions are included as administrative expenses.  The notes include that “No taxation liability arose to the company as a result of such transaction”.  This illustrates that they had taken some tax advice, or reached their own conclusion as to the tax treatment.  Furthermore, it is apparent that CIAISL expected to be able to claim a deduction for corporation tax purposes for the contributions it made to the Trust – they were included as administrative expenses in the accounts and this was used as a starting-point for self-assessing their tax liability.</p>

The question then becomes whether this was the only purpose of CIAISL, ie whether and how this needs to be considered alongside other (business) purposes of CIAISL.</p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In her witness statement and oral evidence Ms Callaby explained that making contributions to the Trust enabled CIAISL to set up a fighting fund, which was of benefit to their customers (as it reduced the price they would pay for insurance) and benefitted the business of CIAISL.  Where insurers are quoting a rate for an insurance product that is too high, ie CIAISL would lose the customer’s business at that price, key managers within CIAISL have authority to offer and approve a discount to that rate being offered.  The premium payable to the insurer remains the same.  Mr Ghosh referred to this as CIAISL “subsidising” the rate, whereas Ms Callaby resisted this term and preferred “discounting”.  Either way, this discount is offered to the customer at the point of sale, but CIAISL pays the full price to the insurer (although this could be several weeks later).  Ms Callaby’s evidence was that CIAISL needed a fighting fund to be able to do this, and this protected their business.</p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I accept that CIAISL benefits from having the resources to offer such discounts and retain existing new customers or win new customers.  However, I am not satisfied that this was the reason for making any of the contributions to the Trust.  There are several reasons for reaching this conclusion:</p>

                <p class="Taxbodytext2" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.38in">This reason was not referred to in the documents to which the directors of CIAISL would be expected to pay close attention (as they are not lengthy legal documents), namely the resolutions of CIAISL which were resolved upon and signed each and every time they made a contribution to the Trust.  Each individual contribution was of a substantial amount, yet there was not a single sentence setting this out as the reason why CIAISL was making the payments.  CIAISL is still making contributions to the Trust, and even a resolution of 28 June 2018 to pay £990,000 to the Trust uses the language about “economic cost” and does not refer to the fighting fund.</p>

I place no weight on its absence from the grounds of appeal and amended grounds of appeal (as the level of detail included in such documents can vary enormously and they are not intended to set out the evidence on which an appellant will rely).  However, it is questionable at the very least that there was no reference to what CIAISL now says was the reason for contributing over £9 million to the Trust in any of the correspondence with HMRC prior to the issue of the assessments, decisions and determinations; and TGFP had specifically informed HMRC (inferentially on the basis of instructions from CIAISL) that “the trust was not intended to deal with any problem/matter”.</p>

They funded this from existing reserves, and Ms Callaby had referred to this as reducing the cash available to be contributed to the Trust.  They do not therefore need a separate fighting fund established through a trust to do this.  </p>

                <p class="Taxbodytext2" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.38in">Instead, by making the contributions to the Trust, CIAISL paid away most of its profits each year.  I have already referred to the fact that the contributions were recorded within “administrative expenses” of the company in its accounts, and for each of the periods ended 31 December 2010 to 31 December 2014 the notes to the accounts state that a very large part of these expenses are the contributions, which is consistent with my findings as to the contributions made by CIAISL.  For these periods, the profits of CIAISL were reduced from £3 million to £100,000 (for the period ended December 2010) and from £7.8 million to £235,000 (for the period ended December 2014), with a similar pattern in intervening years.</p>

Those loans have (with the exception of some amounts lent back to CIAISL) been spent on personal assets of the Shareholders, some of which are held in joint names with others, and some are held solely in another person’s name.

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On the basis of the evidence before me, CIAISL paid contributions to the Trust such as had the result of reducing its profits to between £100,000 and £235,000 for each of the years in issue.  There was no credible evidence as to the determination of the level of contributions to be made – Ms Callaby referred to the contributions as being made out of spare cash, but the evidence in respect of the Purported Contribution of £350,000 in December 2010 supports a conclusion that this was not money that CIAISL had spare or available to it in any event.  I do not need to decide whether the £600,000 resolved to be contributed to the Trust in December 2010 is deductible (as that accounting period is not the subject of this appeal).  However, these contributions (or purported contributions) do provide some context to subsequent transactions (and funded some of the loans to Shareholders which are the subject of the Regulation 80 Determinations and Section 8 Decisions).  The steps taken in relation to the first two contributions do show that CIAISL’s resources were such that it did not want to, or could not, divest itself of £600,000.</p>

The reason for my disagreement is that CIAISL’s appeal against the corporation tax assessments relates to the accounting periods ended 31 December 2011 to 31 December 2014.  Whilst the first such period does include a period of just over four months before this change in law was effective, CIAISL did not make any contributions to the Trust during this period.  It had made contributions (or purported to make them) in December 2010 but the deductibility of those amounts was not in issue before me.  The first contribution in the accounting period ended 31 December 2011 was not resolved to be made until 13 May 2011 (and then paid in three tranches, the first of which was on 19 May 2011).

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I do however briefly set out my conclusions on s1291(2) in any event.  Section 1291(2) provides that “employee benefit scheme” means a trust, scheme or other arrangement “for the benefit of” persons who are, or include, present or former employees of the employer.  (The additional language which was added, also in relation to acts on or after 6 April 2011, is not relevant.)</p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"> Looking at the Trust Deeds alone, the Trust does not meet that definition, as employees are Excluded Persons and cannot be Beneficiaries.  However, I agree with Mr Ghosh that s1291(2) requires consideration of the whole arrangement, as all of the transactions were pre-ordained and the definition contemplates that the scheme may be a “trust, scheme or arrangement”.  On the facts, CIAISL did not understand the terms of the Trust Deed and I also find that CIAISL did not know that employees could not be Beneficiaries under the Trust Deed (notwithstanding the responses given in the Questionnaire).  Instead, the scheme or arrangement which was actually implemented involved payments being made by CIAISL which could then be lent to the Shareholders, and such loans were made by a company they controlled.  The arrangement was for the benefit of persons who are employees of CIAISL.  The arrangement is within s1291(2).  </p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Qualifying benefits are provided if there is a payment of money or a transfer of assets which meets one of four conditions (s1292(1)), one of which is that the payment or transfer gives rise both to an employment income tax charge and to an NIC charge (s1292(2)).  Section 1292(6) provides that these conditions are not met if the payment or transfer is by way of loan.  As the benefits to the Shareholders were the loans under the Finance Agreements, these conditions are not satisfied.  However, s1292(6A) was subsequently enacted and that provides that qualifying benefits are provided if a relevant step within Part 7A is taken and Chapter 2 of that Part applies by reason of the step.  I have concluded that there was a relevant step within Part 7A and that Chapter 2 applies.  On this basis, in principle there would appear to have been qualifying benefits such that the restriction does not apply.  The relevant transitional provisions were not before me and at the hearing the parties agreed that if the application of s1290 mattered (ie the contributions would otherwise be deductible), they could provide further written submissions.  As I have concluded that no such deduction would otherwise be available, and I am only reaching conclusions on the employee benefit scheme rules so far as the points were argued before me, I considered it would not be proportionate to seek further submissions on the transitional arrangements.</p>

That letter reads as if it was Ms Chadbourne who had reached a conclusion that the self-assessment was insufficient.</p>

At that time he had been briefed on how the corporate remuneration trust schemes were thought to work, including HMRC’s position on them, and had opened an enquiry into CIAISL’s position.  However, suspicion falls short of reaching a conclusion that an amount which has been assessed is insufficient.   It was not put to him that this suspicion amounted to a conclusion or a discovery, and I find that it was not.</p>

Logically and efficiently, he could have considered the position for both years at the same time.  It was put to him that if he had grounds to make a discovery and issue an assessment for the period ended 31 December 2011 in December 2015, he also had grounds to make a discovery and issue an assessment for the period ended 31 December 2012 at that time as well.  Mr Midwinter’s response was that he wouldn’t have known that at that time as he had not reviewed the period ended 31 December 2012.  He agreed that when he did review the position in November 2016 his perception had not changed, and added that he had received further information in relation to 2012 (but did not say that the additional information had made any difference).  Whilst this process appears objectively to be somewhat inefficient, I accept that each review involved an examination of information held for the relevant period, alongside other information that was considered to be potentially relevant, and that Mr Midwinter did not reach a conclusion that the amount assessed to tax in respect of the period ended 31 December 2012 was insufficient when he conducted his review in December 2015.  That accounting period had quite simply not been the subject of his review at that time.</p>

This process was completed in accordance with s113(1B) TMA 1970, which provides that where an officer has, in accordance with paragraph 41, decided to make an assessment to tax, and has taken all other decisions needed for arriving at the amount of the assessment, they may entrust to some other officer responsibility for completing the assessing procedure, whether by means involving the use of a computer or otherwise, including responsibility for serving notice of the assessment on the person liable for tax.”  The only decisions required to be taken were to disallow the deductions; the computation was performed by COTAX.  </p>

It is clear that the question posed by this condition is whether a hypothetical officer, on an objective analysis, is made aware of an actual insufficiency in the assessment by the matters disclosed in the information made available.

He was reluctant to attribute such a view to Parliament absent clear words or necessary implication, of which there are neither. He would characterise the payment from the trust or escrow fund as deferred earnings.  It follows that the payment into the trust or escrow fund would not be earnings (at [16]).</p>

He concluded that there is no such requirement.  His reasons included that the primary legislation taxes the employee whose work gives rise to the remuneration, not the recipient of the earnings (at [37]) and that the concept of emoluments is not generally restricted by requiring payment to a specific recipient (at [38]).  He could see nothing in the wider purpose of the legislation, which taxes remuneration from employment, which excludes from the tax charge or the PAYE regime remuneration which the employee is entitled to have paid to a third party (at [39]).  From this, he set out the general rules as being:</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Forde &amp; McHugh</span> the Supreme Court focused on what was received by the employee in the context of a contingent rather than a vested interest in the fund.  Here, all of the amounts paid to the Shareholders were paid to them under the Finance Agreements, pursuant to which they have an obligation to repay those amounts to MEL.  Whilst the Shareholders control MEL, and they have not repaid those sums which are already due, HMRC have not argued that the Finance Agreements do not have legal effect in accordance with their terms, and accordingly I find that the Shareholders do have an obligation to repay the amounts lent to them.  I am not satisfied that receiving such a loan is a reward or benefit, even though I have found that there is a connection with their employment.  For this reason, I agree with Mr Venables that the contributions are not earnings on general principles.</p>

The Request Letters sent by the Shareholders from 29 November 2011 onwards began “As the founder of the Trust…”.  Ms Callaby confirmed in cross-examination that there was nothing different about these later transactions; she also agreed that the request was coming from CIAISL, and that they had signed the Request Letters as employees of CIAISL.  Mr Ghosh submitted that as the Founder was CIAISL, these letters were from CIAISL rather than the three Shareholders personally and the only connection which they had with CIAISL was as employees.

Absent any arguments around validity and trusts, I would have no doubt in concluding that the arrangements involved relevant steps being taken, being (at the very least) the transfer from Baxendale Walker’s client account to MEL’s account and the loan of that money by MEL to the Shareholders.  They were visible steps, between relevant persons, and money moved enabling the Shareholders to have access thereto and to spend it as they wished.  The question is therefore whether Mr Venables’ submissions as to the actions involving breach of trust are made out on the law or on the facts.  I set out below the changes made to the definition, the Trust Arguments and the requirement that there be a “payment” and consider these in the context of the relevant condition.</p>

The sums transferred to the Baxendale Walker client account were held on resulting trust for CIAISL, such that when they were transferred to MEL, MEL also held that money on trust for CIAISL.  MEL had no power to lend CIAISL’s money to the Shareholders, and they also held on trust for CIAISL (Mr Herbert clarified that MEL and the Shareholders would, on this argument, hold on constructive trust by reason of their knowing receipt, but both parties agreed that nothing turned on this difference between resulting and constructive trusts).  Mr Venables submitted that where the true analysis is that MEL is a legal owner (with only bare legal title) holding on trust for CIAISL, the Shareholders equally only acquired bare legal title, and this is not a payment of money.  (Alternatively, and this is considered separately below, if it is a relevant step, the value of bare legal title is nil, such that the amount taxable under Part 7A is nil.)</p>

I agree with Mr Ghosh that the changes that were made by FA 2017 did not change the position.  There is nothing in the legislation as in force prior to that time (ie that with which this appeal is concerned) that requires that the steps taken must be legally enforceable; and I do not consider this is required by the definition of a relevant step as a payment of a sum of money.</p>

                <p class="Taxquotation" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">This appeal involves two distinct questions of principle. The first concerns the meaning of the word "payment" in the definition of the term "unauthorised member payment" in section 160(2) of the Finance Act 2004 , and the consequential charges to income tax in respect of such payments contained in sections 208 to 210 . The question, in short, is whether the word "payment", construed in its statutory context, is apt to include a transfer of money (in the tax year 2009/10) from one registered pension scheme to another, in circumstances where it later transpired that the trusts of the recipient scheme were void for uncertainty. The agreed consequence of this is that the transfer was in law effective to transfer only bare legal title to the money, the beneficial interest in which was held on a resulting trust for the transferor.”</p>

                <p class="Taxbodytext2" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.38in">It was deeply unrealistic to approach the question whether the transfer was a "payment" for the purposes of s160(2) on the basis that the failure of the trusts should, without more, prevent the subsection from applying.  As a matter of practical reality, the money left the Suffolk Life SIPP and was credited by means of a CHAPS transfer to an LML Pension bank account with National Westminster Bank in Bristol.  The money therefore passed from the direct control of Suffolk Life, and was then used to implement (with some variations) the subsequent stages of the scheme (at [39]).</p>

The money was intended to pass from the control and supervision of one registered pension scheme to another, the Suffolk Life SIPP was left apparently defunct, and legal title (at least) to the money had passed from Suffolk Life to the LML Pension.  From a practical and common-sense perspective, why should it make any difference to this analysis if it later transpired that, unknown to everybody at the time, the transfer was in fact defective and gave rise to a resulting trust?  In the context of the carefully designed scheme of the 2004 Act, one would not expect the meaning of an everyday word like "payment" to depend on legal niceties of that kind (at [40]).</p>

Several years after the transfer the Pension Ombudsman ordered the employer to repay this surplus to the fund.  The company then took action against HMRC to recover the tax which had been paid.  The question before the High Court was whether the tax had been due to HMRC, which in turn depended on whether there had been a payment to the employer.  HMRC’s argument was that money had actually moved, the language was clear and unambiguous and there was no need to apply a purposive construction.</p>

The practical reality of the pre-ordained steps which took place is that the Shareholders have use of the funds which CIAISL had resolved to contribute to the Trust.  I agree with Mr Ghosh that Part 7A is anti-avoidance legislation which seeks to prevent individuals from extracting cash tax-free in circumstances where the monies are advanced in connection with their employment.  The legislation is clear that the arrangements with which these provisions are concerned does not need to be legally enforceable, and I consider that there is no basis for a conclusion that I should construe the word “payment” in such a way as to introduce this requirement.  </p>

However, I would briefly note that as I have concluded that the loans made by MEL to the Shareholders are treated as employment income by Part 7A, I accept Mr Ghosh’s submission that those loans made from and including 6 December 2011 are to be treated as remuneration derived from an employed earner’s employment for the purposes of s3 SSCBA 1992 irrespective of my conclusions on paragraph 5.  If I had concluded that the payments were within paragraph 5 and thus disregarded in the calculation of earnings, Regulation 22B would operate to override this by providing expressly that the payments are treated as remuneration derived from employment. </p>
