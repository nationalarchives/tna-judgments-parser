Most have accepted the jurisdiction of this Court but two of them, D4, VP Fund Solutions (Luxembourg) SA, whom I shall call VP Lux, and D5, VP Fund Solutions (Liechtenstein) AG, whom I shall call VP Liecht, challenge jurisdiction. VP Liecht also seeks to set aside the Order of Butcher J of 10 June 2021 which granted the Claimants permission to serve the claim form out of the jurisdiction. </p>

The Claimants say that in 2019 MDM elected for his entitlement to a dividend from Emmediemme to be satisfied by a transfer of the shares held by Emmediemme in the HFPO compartment to himself, by way of a dividend in specie.</p>

Paragraph 102 of the AmPOC pleads the facts from which it is said the combination is to be inferred, and paragraph 103 pleads the unlawful means, namely (a) the fraudulent Independence Representations (but not the Investment Representation), (b) the breaches of fiduciary duty by XY, and (c) the dishonest assistance by Mr Migani in facilitating XY’s breaches of fiduciary duty.

If that is wrong, and in any event in relation to the claim by GIG (which, being a corporate, is clearly not a consumer) VP Lux, which accepts the burden on this issue falls on it, seeks to rely on what it says are exclusive jurisdiction clause (“EJCs”). VP Lux relies, as against MDM, on an EJC in a letter, between Emmediemme, Skew Base GP, and VP Lux. VP Lux also relies, against both C1 and C2 on what it says is an EJC contained in the Subscription documents under which the investments were made. If either of those EJC arguments prevail, as to which the parties agree that the standard is simply whether VP Lux has the better of the argument, the EJCs mean that this Court can have no jurisdiction. If not, the question is whether an exception to BRR applies. The Claimants rely on BRR Art 8(1), saying that the claim against VP Lux is so closely connected with the claim against XY and/or Mr Migani that is expedient to hear and determine them together; and/or on BRR Art 7(2) on the basis that the damage occurred, or alternatively say that the place of the event which gave rise to the damage is England.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact that different regimes are applicable requires particular care to be exercised in defining the issues which arise for decision, but by the close of the hearing the parties were agreed that the following list of issues and route map accurately captures the issues which might arise for decision, although of course some outcomes on certain issues would obviate the need to decide other issues, and for reasons which I shall explain I do not need, in the event, need to decide every one of these issues in order to deal with these applications. It is also important to note that the VP Lux and VP Liecht issues are to some extent interdependent since (for instance) the decision whether to exercise discretion to permit service out on VP Liecht might be exercised differently depending on whether VP Lux were going to be sued here.</p>

The parties were agreed that it is not an essential element of this tort that the injury intended and the injury sustained should be the same. But there must be loss or damage that was as a matter of fact caused by the unlawful acts, otherwise there would be no causal connection between the wrong and the loss for which compensation is sought. In this respect I accept Mr Saoul QC’s submission, for the Claimants, that it should not be surprising that, in an intentional tort which connotes a high degree of reprehensibility, the losses recovered do not need to align with the losses that were intended, in broadly the same way that damages in the tort of deceit extend to all losses flowing directly from the tort, whether or not foreseeable. </p>

I stress that I accept that it is perfectly possible that the VP Defendants had no knowledge, nor even any suspicion, that Mr Migani and XY might have been presenting the Skew Base Fund as independent when in fact it was not; but I do not consider that I can be so confident that those allegations will fail that I can say that there is no serious issue to be tried.</p>

But it seems to me there is amply sufficient material pleaded against the VP Liecht at this stage for me to be able to say that as things stand there is a serious issue to be tried as to whether or not VP Liecht was party to a combination to use the unlawful means alleged, and as to VP Liecht’s knowledge of the facts constituting those unlawful means.</p>

A high degree of blameworthiness is called for, because intention serves as the factor which justifies imposing liability on the defendant for loss caused by a wrong otherwise not actionable by the claimant against the defendant. The defendant’s conduct in relation to the loss must be deliberate. In particular, a defendant’s foresight that his unlawful conduct may or will probably damage the claimant cannot be equated with intention for this purpose. The defendant must intend to injure the claimant. This intent must be a cause of the defendant’s conduct, in the words of Cooke J in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Van Camp Chocolates Ltd v Aulsebrooks Ltd</span><span style="font-style:italic"> [1984] 1 NZLR 354, 360.

Take a case where a defendant seeks to advance his own business by pursuing a course of conduct which he knows will, in the very nature of things, necessarily be injurious to the claimant. In other words, a case where loss to the claimant is the obverse side of the coin from gain to the defendant. The defendant’s gain and the claimant’s loss are, to the defendant’s knowledge, inseparably linked. The defendant cannot obtain the one without bringing about the other. If the defendant goes ahead in such a case in order to obtain the gain he seeks, his state of mind will satisfy the mental ingredient of the unlawful interference tort.</span></p>

Here the harm to the Claimant which it is alleged that the Defendants intended is that the Claimants did not know that they were not getting, and did not in fact get, independent advice. As a result of that – it is said – they invested when they otherwise would not have done so. That inevitably brings financial benefit to the VP Defendants, for they will inevitably receive benefits by way of fees as a result of the decision to invest, whether that investment prospers or fails. </p>

To this extent, I am satisfied that the object of the conspiracy was to interfere with HPII's rights in and relation to the Hyde Park Hotels, but I am unable to find that, in so doing, the Defendants intended that HPII should be paid less for the Hyde Park Hotels than they were then worth, or that they had concluded that HPII would be able to realise the development opportunity itself but for their intervention.</span></p>

The argument that someone who wishes to obtain an asset from the claimant, and who uses unlawful means to keep the claimant in ignorance of a basis for refusing to entertain the offer or asking for more favourable terms, does not intend to injure is one which I do not find attractive, particularly given the recognition that “negotiating damages”, when awarded, represent compensation for a real loss in </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">One Step (Support) Ltd v Morris-Garnier</span><span style="font-style:italic"> [2019] AC 649 .

It took the form of a letter from Emmediemme to VP Lux and Skew Base GP, in which Emmediemme said that it was “interested in an investment programme addressed to a few investors” and said that Emmediemme “would be grateful if you could send us the Offering memorandum and subscription documentation.” At clause 1.3 Emmediemme declared that it was willing to subscribe for shares in the HFPO Centaurus compartment of the Fund, and Emmediemme committed to do so, subject to a series of conditions precedent which were then set out. Then Emmediemme said:</p>

Once the investment has subscribed for, the letter agreement becomes history, and going forward the parties’ obligations depend on the terms of the Subscription Agreement. Clause 1.4 of the Letter Agreement makes this point explicitly.</p>

In view of the consequences that such an option may have on the position of the parties to the action, the requirements set out in Article 17 governing the validity of clauses conferring jurisdiction must be strictly construed. By making such validity subject to the existence of an “agreement” between the parties, Article 17 imposes on the court before which the matter is brought the duty of examining, first, whether the clause conferring jurisdiction upon it was in fact the subject of a consensus between the parties, which must be clearly and precisely demonstrated. The purpose of the formal requirements imposed by Article 17 is to ensure that the consensus between the parties is in fact established.”</p>

I am not satisfied that it was. The position seems to me to have been, on any objective view, confusing. The Subscription Form contained a choice of law clause but no accompanying choice of jurisdiction clause. That is an unpromising start. The most that Mr Blakeley can say is that the Subscription Form incorporated the Offering document by reference, and the Offering Document stated that the Subscription Form contained a “choice of international competence” of the Court of Luxembourg. But in fact it didn’t. Mr Blakeley points to the provision at the end of the Subscription Form which says that in the case of “differences between the information in the Application Form and the Fund’s Offering Documents the latter shall prevail.” I am not satisfied that what is in issue here is properly characterised is a difference in “information” between the two forms.</p>

But Mr Blakeley realistically agreed that if the conspiracy claims against XY and Dr Migani were going to proceed in this court (as, on the basis of my findings, they are) it would indeed be expedient for the conspiracy claims against VBP Lux to be tried here alongside those claims arising from the same alleged conspiracy.</p>

I was referred to a number of statements on the duty of disclosure in the context of applications for freezing injunctions. In such cases the court is being asked to make an order of an exceptional kind, prohibiting or restricting a defendant's use of its own assets before any adjudication has been made against it. Because of its draconian nature, it is a jurisdiction which requires great caution and a wide range of factors may have a bearing on the court's decision. </span></p>

The general principles about disclosure on without notice applications still apply, but the context is different. The focus of the inquiry is on whether the court should assume jurisdiction over a dispute. The court needs to be satisfied that there is a dispute properly to be heard (i.e. that there is a serious issue to be tried); that there is a good arguable case that the court has jurisdiction to hear it; and that England is clearly the appropriate forum. Beyond that, the court is not concerned with the merits of the case. </span></p>

Whilst these issues are highly material to VP Lux, they seem to me to be of only very passing relevance to VP Liecht and in my view, Mr Blakeley was right not to press this point with any vigour. I find there was no breach of the duty of fair presentation on this point.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second alleged non-disclosure relates to some emails from March and April 2020, written in Italian, English translations of which have since been disclosed. The English translations suggest that Mr Nuzzo knew that XY or its officers were controlling the Skew Base Funds, a point which if correct would be relevant to the strength of the claims in deceit, and therefore of some relevance to the strength of the claim against VP Liecht. But Mr Nuzzo says that the true meaning of the Italian he used was simply that XY was monitoring or watching the Skew Base Funds. In those circumstances it seems to me that there is – in terms of non-disclosure - nothing in this point.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third alleged non-disclosure is that the Claimants did not disclose to Butcher J the fact that, at the time that application was made, that they had also invested in the real estate compartment of the Fund and that that investment was up by some 11%. Mr Blakeley says that these facts were and are relevant to the question of whether or not the VP defendants intended to injure the Claimants. He further submits that the non-disclosure is aggravated by the way the claim was pleaded which suggested that the investments about which complaint is made were the only investments made. I agree that the POC at least gives the impression that the only investments made were those that sustained heavy losses.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">Second, they say that the performance of the successful investments is not relevant to whether or not the Defendants intended that the Claimants would suffer injury, because the nature of the harm alleged to have been intended is confined to the detriment of not being independently advised.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to this second point, I have already held that the Claimants’ distinction between intended harm and the damage in fact sustained is a valid distinction, and it follows from that that the non-disclosure is not in fact material.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It would have been much better had the Claimants disclosed their profitable investments, because the failure to do so inevitably left the court on the ex parte application with an incomplete view of the overall factual matrix, but given that the non-disclosure was in fact irrelevant and given that, even if it ought to have been disclosed the disclosure would have made no difference, it does not seem to me that VP Liecht is entitled to have the order for service out set aside.</p>

The parties were not agreed as to which version I ought to focus on. It seems to me the pragmatic approach is to consider the AmPOC because even if the technically correct version to use were the original POC, and even if differences between the two versions were to give rise to a different outcome in terms of the applications, there is no imminent limitation issue in this case and the Claimants would then just start again with their amended pleading. In the event I am not satisfied that using the original POC would have made any difference to the outcome of this application. Jurisdiction applications should not turn on very fine points of pleading because the court ought to be concerned with the substance of the claims that the Claimants wish to advance. The substance of the claim is clearly the same in the original and the amended pleading.</p>
