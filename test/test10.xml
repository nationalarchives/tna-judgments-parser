              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an appeal brought with leave of Gloster J against an arbitration award.  In the arbitration the two Shell companies were Claimants and the Respondent was Centurion Petroleum Corporation, now known as Dana Gas Egypt Limited.

            <content>
              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The arbitration arose out of a “Farm-In and LNG Co-Operation Agreement” hereinafter “the FIA” concluded between Shell and Centurion on 17 March 2006.  In the arbitration Shell claimed damages for the repudiatory breach of the agreement which they had, they said, accepted as terminating the same.  In the alternative Shell claimed that a different breach of contract invested them with a contractual right of rescission which right they had exercised as a result of which certain financial consequences were prescribed by the contract.  Centurion denied the breaches, denied that the former breach if made good was repudiatory in quality and denied that Shell terminated the contract either by acceptance of repudiatory breach or in accordance with the contractual right of rescission.  Shell had they said, as they were entitled to do, terminated the contract on notice on account of “Closing” as therein defined not having occurred within nine months following the Agreement Date.  Centurion counter-claimed what they said was Shell’s share of certain costs incurred in respect of “Joint Operations”.  </p>

            <content>
              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The arbitrators, Michael Brindle QC, Ali Malek QC and Stephen York, held that Centurion were in repudiatory breach of contract and that they were in further breach in a manner which entitled Shell to exercise the contractual right to rescind.  However they also held that Shell had neither accepted the repudiatory breach as terminating the contract nor exercised their contractual right of rescission.  They had they said exercised a contractual right to terminate on 30 days’ notice pursuant to clause 3.1.8 of the FIA.  That right had been exercised by letter dated 22 December 2006.  On the following day Centurion waived the notice period.  It followed that the FIA terminated by operation of its provisions, and waiver of the notice period, in circumstances which invested Shell with no right to damages or recovery of sums paid under the Agreement.  The arbitrators reserved determination of the quantum of Centurion’s counter-claim.  </p>

            <content>
              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is against the arbitrators’ conclusion that they neither accepted the repudiation nor exercised a contractual right to rescind that Shell appeal.  That conclusion turns upon the proper construction and effect to be given to Shell’s letter of 22 December 2006.  That letter must of course be construed in the light of the terms of the contract and the circumstances as they appeared objectively to the parties at the time when it was received.  I must therefore briefly describe the contractual background and the situation in which the parties found themselves in December 2006.  In doing so I do not intend to depart from the description given by the arbitrators themselves – indeed despite argument to the contrary by Mr Robert Hildyard QC for Centurion I do not believe that I am entitled to do so.  </p>

Discussions between the parties, which led to the making of the FIA, took place between about September 2005 and March 2006.  Shell’s deal team was led by Mr Eggink, who reported indirectly to Ms Powell.  </p>

Shell considered that there was a good chance of successfully finding gas in the shallow horizons, as well as significant additional potential in the deeper levels.  The main objective for Shell in entering the joint venture was to explore for gas and develop the gas for export as Liquefied Natural Gas (‘LNG’), although Shell also hoped to supply the Egyptian domestic market.  </p>

This was to be achieved by CTIP assigning its interest in the concessions to Centurion, and Centurion then assigning half of the whole interest to Shell.  In fact, as explained below, Closing under the FIA never occurred.  It follows that Shell’s anticipated 50% interest in the concessions never vested.”</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Completion of the assignment by Centurion to Shell of half of the whole interest in the concessions in accordance with the provisions of the Agreement was described in the FIA as “Closing”.  The period between the conclusion of the FIA on 17 March 2006 and Closing was known as the Closing Period.  Closing under the FIA was  conditional upon six conditions precedent being satisfied as set out in Clause 2.2.  Relevantly, one such condition was “Completion of the CTIP Acquisition”, meaning the acquisition by Centurion of CTIP’s 25% interest.  Assignment by CTIP to Centurion required Government consent but this had been forthcoming and the CTIP Acquisition was completed by 27 April 2006.  </p>

            <content>
              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Closing however never occurred.  If it had not occurred within nine months following the Agreement Date Shell had the right to “elect, by 30 days’ notice in writing to Centurion, to terminate this Agreement” – clause 3.1.8.  A termination under clause 3.1.8 did not generate in Shell any right to recovery of sums paid under the Agreement.  The arbitrators do not in terms find why Closing had not occurred by 17 December 2006 and it does not matter.  However in an e-mail sent by Centurion to Shell on 21 December 2006 Centurion indicated that Closing was unlikely to occur until the New Year as a result of delays in obtaining Government approvals – see paragraph 93.  The arbitrators at paragraph 95 set out the content of an internal Centurion e-mail dated 19 December 2006 which is to similar effect.  Those Government approvals are obviously further and additional to those required for the CTIP Acquisition.  However the contract further provided, by Clause 3.1.9, that if the reason for the Closing Date not having occurred within the nine months referred to in Clause 3.1.8 was because the CTIP Acquisition had itself not completed then Shell, on electing to terminate under Clause 3.1.8, were additionally entitled to the return of all payments made under the contract.  </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At paragraphs 29 to 31 of their Award the arbitrators summarised certain key provisions of the FIA.  By Clause 3.1.1 (a) Shell agreed to pay US$15 million to Centurion within 30 days of the date of the FIA.  This was duly paid.  The FIA provided for the drilling of an “Initial Five Wells”, being the first five exploration wells drilled in the concession areas, as agreed between the parties.  See Clause 3.1.1(b)); the definition of “Initial Five Wells” in Clause 1.1; and Schedule E.  By Clause 13.3 Shell was given the right to withdraw from the FIA after the drilling of the fifth of the Initial Five Wells.  If Shell did not exercise this right, it was required by clause 3.1.1(b) (subject to certain now immaterial conditions) to pay US$20 million to Centurion.  This payment became due 30 days following release of the rig after drilling of the fifth well, although it was postponed if by that date the CTIP Acquisition was not completed.  </p>

The broad scheme of the provisions in Article 8 was that certain operations could be proposed as Exclusive Operations, but only after they had been proposed as Joint Operations.  A party wishing to propose an Exclusive Operation had to give notice to the other of its intention to do so.  The other party then had the right, within the notice period, to participate, in which case the operation became a Joint Operation.  If the party receiving the notice elected not to participate, then the party which had proposed the operation could proceed with it as an Exclusive Operation.  However, in that event, the non-participating party retained the right subsequently to participate upon the giving of notice, and upon the payment of a hefty cash premium – for the privilege of reinstating rights which had been relinquished.  In the case of the drilling of an Exploration Well, the cash premium was 600% of the non-consenting party’s share of the costs and expenses incurred in relation to the operation.

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first two wells were Al Hamra-1 and Al Deeb-1, both with spud dates prior to the parties entering into the FIA.  Both were dry in their primary drilling objective and failed to reach their secondary drilling objective.  After agreement to the FIA Shell suggested to Centurion that the next well to be drilled should be at the Luzi-1 location.  On 16 May 2006 Centurion agreed to drilling Luzi-1 as the next well but on the understanding that it would not count as one of the Initial Five Wells.  Shell were asked to confirm that they would participate in the drilling of “the first of the deep wells, which will be considered as the fifth well under the FIA”.  Shell did not give the requested confirmation.  The Luzi-1 well was drilled on and after 23 May 2006.  Drilling resulted in a discovery of commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.  However, an incident occurred when the rig reached 1,000 metres below sea level and encountered an internal blow-out.  Drilling of two further wells, Al Hurani-1 and South Gamasa-1 began in July and August 2006.  Al Hurani-1 reached planned total depth, but was dry.  South Gamasa-1 failed to reach the planned depth, and could not penetrate into the Sidi Salim, the horizon above the Oligocene.  None of these was, I infer, what Centurion meant by a “deep well” in the message of 16 May 2006 to which I referred earlier.  A telephone conversation took place on 23 August 2006 between Ms Powell and David Thomas, Chief Operating Officer of Centurion.  Mr Thomas, contrary to Centurion’s earlier position, suggested that South Gamasa-1 was the fifth of the Initial Five Wells and that Shell would, therefore, have to decide, after the drilling of this well, whether to continue with the joint venture.  Ms Powell stated her understanding that Luzi-1 was not one of the Initial Five Wells, so that South Gamasa-1 was the fourth, not the fifth well.  They both agreed to check the position as it was critical to an understanding of the way forward.  In further communications it became clear that neither party had a clear approach as to whether Luzi-1 was included in the first five wells or not.  On 3 October 2006 Centurion wrote formally to Shell suggesting that Luzi-1 was to be counted in the Initial Five Wells.  Shell replied by a letter dated 9 October 2006 saying that the Luzi-1 well was not an exploration well and that South Gamasa-1 was the fourth of the Initial Five Wells.  </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The significance of this dispute is of course that pursuant to clause 3.1.1(b) if Shell did not withdraw from the Agreement following completion of the Initial Five Wells they incurred a liability to pay US$20 million to Centurion 30 days following the release of the rig after the drilling of the fifth well.  The arbitrators made a finding at paragraph 76 of their Award that on 7 December 2006 Centurion, without Shell’s approval, mobilised the rig from South Gamasa to the Marzouk site.  The arbitrators do not find but I infer that that arguably amounted to release of the rig after drilling the South Gamasa-1 well.  The arbitrators did not need to determine whether Luzi-1 was to be counted as one of the Initial Five Wells and thus whether South Gamasa-1 was the fifth well.  It was common ground before me that if South Gamasa-1 was the fifth well, then the US$20 million payment was due on 6 January 2007 unless the contract had by then been terminated, or notice to terminate had been given under clause 3.1.8.  </p>

It also made disclosure of Shell’s election to rescind the FIA in the event of a breach of Centurion’s warranties prior to closing.

In response to Mr Thomas’s concern that Shell had not approved the seismic, Ms Powell accepted that she could ‘well see’ why Shell should participate in the seismic, but that ‘approval had not been asked’.  Mr Thomas’s evidence, which we accept, is that he understood that Shell had no fundamental objection to the acquisition of the additional seismic.  According to Ms Powell’s note: ‘I asked in a roundabout way whether he thought he could sole risk; he said he thought so but that if he couldn’t he was sure that Shell legal would tell him.’  </p>

By definition in the FIA, the CTIP Acquisition was complete when Centurion received delivery of the deeds of assignment, duly signed by the Government, transferring the interest from CTIP to Centurion.  It is also worth noting that Shell has been provided with a copy of the signed deeds of assignment by Centurion and Shell confirmed receipt of same at an Operating Committee Meeting held on the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> November 2006.

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The arbitrators found that when sending the Termination Letter Shell, in the shape of Mr Eggink and Mr Crichton, mistakenly believed that the CTIP Acquisition had not yet been completed.  Since they also found that Mr Bloomfield of Shell had been informed of the true position and given the relevant documents at a meeting in Egypt on 15 November 2006, they plainly regarded Mr Eggink and Mr Crichton as for this purpose constituting the directing mind of Shell.  Before me Centurion characterised Shell’s mistake as “flimsy, subjective, internal and self-induced”, suggesting that it at most comprised a misinterpretation by a senior lawyer at Shell as to the clear effect of documents that he had apparently read and studied.  This characterisation goes way beyond anything that can possibly be spelled out of the arbitrators’ findings.  I take the arbitrators’ findings at face value.  When Shell sent the Termination Letter a mistake was made.  Indeed it is obvious that Shell had made a mistake, and it must have been obvious to Centurion however surprising they may have found it.  It was not suggested that anyone could have thought that Shell were deliberately misrepresenting the position for some ulterior purpose.  </p>

They point out that Shell gave a notice which indicated that the contract would remain in force for a further thirty days, terminating only on expiry of the notice period.

There must I think be limits to that principle, which did not need to be explored in either of those two cases.  It would perhaps be surprising if there were an inflexible rule that an acceptance of a repudiation can only be effective if it purports to bring about immediate termination in circumstances where the contract calls for no performance from either party in the interval before termination is expressed to take effect.  In such circumstances there would surely be no affirmation.  </p>

Firstly, although Mr Hildyard struggled to identify any real content to such contractual obligations as might subsist during the thirty day notice period, I do not consider that in the absence of a finding by the arbitrators, or any discussion by them of the point, I should conclude that the contract was by then entirely devoid of content.  Secondly however I consider that Shell can only succeed if they can demonstrate that their Termination Letter should not have been understood as intended to effect a termination under Clause 3.1.8 of the FIA in the event that Clause 3.1.9 was of no application.  If Shell can show that, then their letter is not to be regarded as giving thirty days’ notice of termination.  </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In that regard Shell contend that the arbitrators, by ignoring Shell’s mistake, proceeded upon the basis of a false dichotomy.  At paragraph 125 of their Award they identified as “the relevant election” the choice between on the one hand accepting the repudiation and bringing the contract to an end and, on the other hand, affirming the contract – see per Lord Goff in <span style="font-style:italic">Motor Oil Hellas (Corinth) Refineries SA v Shipping Corporation of India, The “Kanchenjunga”</span>, [1990] 1 Lloyd’s LR 391 at 398.  Since Shell knew all of the facts required to make that election, the arbitrators regarded it as irrelevant that Shell erroneously believed that they had rights under Clause 3.1.9.  The arbitrators concluded that Shell elected to terminate on notice under Clause 3.1.8, thereby affirming the contract – see Award paragraphs 143(1) and 143(6).  Shell attack this reasoning.  It ignores the fact, they say, that Shell thought that the choice was not between terminating for repudiatory breach or terminating on notice under Clause 3.1.8 simpliciter but rather between terminating for repudiatory breach, with the opportunity to recover damages consequential thereon, and terminating on notice <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and</span> receiving a refund of all payments made because Clause 3.1.9 was also applicable.  Their election was not therefore an informed choice.  It is obvious, they suggest, that had they realised that Clause 3.1.9 was in fact inapplicable they would not have invoked Clause 3.1.8 thereby abandoning their opportunity to claim damages for the repudiatory breach of contract.  In this regard they rely upon the presumption, articulated by Lord Diplock in <span style="font-style:italic">Modern Engineering v Gilbert Ash</span> [1974] AC 689 at 717, to the effect that in construing a contract it should be presumed that neither party intends to abandon any remedies for its breach arising by operation of law.  They point out that a letter which on any view showed a clear intention to bring the contract to an end has been treated as an affirmation of the contract.  They ask what principle requires a clear election to terminate on the basis that a substantial sum is recoverable to be treated as a termination on the basis that nothing is recoverable.  They also say that since the settlement agreement which they negotiated on 18 December 2006 clearly showed them attempting to extract value from the contract, it is the less likely that their Termination Letter written four days later could objectively be construed as an abandonment of any value in the contract.  </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Centurion for their part suggest that it is by no means obvious that Shell, conscious of the unavailability of Clause 3.1.9, would have elected to terminate for what was then a disputed breach rather than invoke the contractual termination procedure under Clause 3.1.8 which was indubitably available, nine months having elapsed since the Agreement Date without Closing having been achieved.  Centurion suggests that the critical feature in the light of which Shell’s Termination Letter, sent on the last working day before Christmas, falls to be construed is the impending obligation on Shell to pay US$20 million which would fall due on 6 January 2007 if South Gamasa-1 was, as Centurion were then asserting, the fifth well.  Centurion suggests therefore that the proper interpretation to be put upon Shell’s Termination Letter is a clear choice to invoke the certain remedy under Clause 3.1.8 which conclusively removed Shell’s further exposure rather than to run the risk of losing the argument about change of control.  </p>

That was however a case of acceptance by silence, or more accurately by the failure of the sellers to take any further step to perform the contract which was apparent to the buyers and from which they knew that the sellers were treating the contract as at an end.  Before Shell can avail themselves of this principle they must first overcome the hurdle of showing that their Termination Letter did not communicate a clear intention to terminate contractually under Clause 3.1.8 rather than to terminate for repudiatory breach.  </p>

                <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The invalid invocation of a right to terminate contractually on account of a breach of contract is capable of being effective to accept a repudiatory breach as terminating the contract if it unequivocally demonstrates an intention to treat the contractual obligations as at an end.  See <span style="font-style:italic">Stocznia Gdanska SA v Latvian Shipping Co.</span> [2002] 2 Lloyd’s LR 436.  That however was a case where the contractual provision invoked was not a self-contained code, resort to which would necessarily exclude resort to the remedies generally available at law, but was rather “built on the underpinnings of the common law remedies for breach of contract” – see per Rix LJ at page 449, paragraph 72.  Clause 3.1.8 may not be a complete code but resort thereto is inconsistent with treating the contract as terminated by acceptance of a repudiatory breach, not least because the clause is not triggered by breach and provides that in the event of resort to it Centurion shall not be obliged to repay to Shell any amounts paid under Clause 3.1.1.  Mr McCaughran for Shell realistically accepted that if the Termination Letter is to be taken as an unequivocal communication by Shell of its decision to terminate the contract under Clause 3.1.8, it cannot also serve as effective to accept Centurion’s repudiatory breach as terminating the contract.  </p>

The context in that case was that the same conduct was capable of giving rise to a contractual right to terminate and a common law entitlement to accept a repudiatory breach.  Since prima facie the innocent party can rely on both rights recourse to the former does not constitute an affirmation of the contract since in both cases he is electing to terminate the contract.  However, if a notice “makes explicit reference to a particular contractual clause, and nothing else, this may, in context, show that the giver of the notice was not intending to accept the repudiation and was only relying on the contractual clause; for instance if the claim made under the notice of termination is inconsistent with, and not simply less than, that which arises on acceptance of a repudiation … In the present case markedly different consequences would arise according to whether or not there was a termination under Clause 14.4 or an acceptance of a repudiation.”  See per Christopher Clarke J at pages 632-633.  </p>

In such cases it is sufficient for the injured party simply to make it clear that he is treating the contract as discharged…  If he gives a bad reason for doing so, his action is nonetheless effective if the circumstances support it.

However the second paragraph quoted above, in fact the third paragraph of the letter, can only be referring to Clause 3.1.8 because that is the only clause which gives to Shell the right “to elect to terminate” where the Closing Date has not occurred within nine months following the Agreement Date.  Furthermore Clause 3.1.9, to which express reference is made, is by its terms applicable only where Shell has elected to terminate in accordance with Clause 3.1.8.  Mr McCaughran says that in circumstances where it is apparent from the face of the letter that a mistake had been made as to the applicability of Clause 3.1.9, it is impossible to read the letter as containing an unequivocal communication of an intention on the part of Shell to terminate under Clause 3.1.8.  If that is right, then it is ineffective to give thirty days’ notice of termination and no question of affirmation can arise.  </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I can see no reason why Shell could not have served a notice which accepted the repudiatory breach as terminating the contract but, in the alternative, in case they were wrong in asserting that Centurion were in repudiatory breach, exercised the contractual right to terminate afforded by Clause 3.1.8, with or without reliance additionally upon Clause 3.1.9.  A reasonable recipient of the Termination Letter in the place of Centurion would I consider legitimately have wondered why that was not done, although Centurion of course denied that there had been a material change of control let alone that their conduct in relation thereto was repudiatory.  Mr McCaughran said that the reason why that was not done was because Shell were mistaken about Clause 3.1.9.  The reasonable recipient would indeed have realised that Shell were mistaken about Clause 3.1.9, but I am not sure that he would have concluded that that was the reason why Shell had not served a notice in this hybrid or alternative form.  Furthermore the reasonable recipient would notice that the Termination Letter made express reference to the sole risk operations breach but made no mention of the arguably more serious contention that Centurion’s conduct in relation to the alleged change of control had deprived Shell of the opportunity to acquire Centurion’s Participating Interest in the Concessions and/or to assume the operatorship.  The reasonable recipient in the place of Centurion would have had in mind the terms upon which Shell had shown themselves willing to compromise going forward.  Those terms showed a sensitivity to the question of the imminent US$20 million payment – the proposal was that a further deep well be drilled, be regarded as the fifth well, and that even then only 50% of the US$20 million payment would become due on completion of drilling of the well.  It is also in my view not without significance that Shell were prepared to forego any right to pre-empt or take over operatorship following change of control.  </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In these circumstances it seems to me that a reasonable recipient of the Termination Letter in the place of Centurion would not regard it as implausible that Shell had simply decided to cut their losses and withdraw from the agreement on a basis which offered certainty that no further obligation would fall due for performance.  Whilst the reasonable recipient would realise that Shell wrongly thought that on this basis they could recover their US$15 million, I do not think that realisation of that mistake would be sufficient in itself to remove the essential thrust of the letter, which was that Shell wished to ensure that they had no further obligation to perform.  The context of the settlement agreement would incline the reasonable recipient to think that Shell were more concerned about spending further money than in attempting, under whatever rubric, to recover compensation in respect of what they perceived as breaches of the Agreement by Centurion.  The Agreement had, from Shell’s perspective, been a disappointment.  The letter as written plainly communicates an unequivocal election to terminate under Clause 3.1.8.  In my judgment the obvious mistake contained in it does not, in context, derogate from that message, because it was a perfectly feasible commercial stance for Shell to adopt that they wished simply to withdraw from the Agreement without incurring any further obligation whether that enabled them to recover their initial payment or not.  The imperative was clarity that Shell had no further obligation under the Agreement.  </p>
