            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In January 2019 the Appellant Philip Parr brought employment tribunal proceedings alleging direct age discrimination by the Respondents. An issue was raised as to whether the claim had been issued in time, which was dealt with at a Preliminary Hearing in the ET at London Central before Employment Judge Elliott on 11 and 12 September 2019. EJ Elliott determined that the Respondents’ acts complained of amounted to “conduct extending over a period” within the terms of s 123(3)(a) of the Equality Act 2010 and that the claim had therefore been issued in time. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Respondents appealed to the Employment Appeal Tribunal. By a decision handed down on 24 June 2021 Mathew Gullick QC, sitting in the EAT as a deputy High Court judge (“the judge”), held that there had been no “conduct extending over a period” beyond 30 April 2018 and that the claim was therefore out of time. He allowed the Respondents’ appeal, set aside the finding of the ET, and remitted the claim to the ET (if practicable, EJ Elliott) to determine whether to extend time for the presentation of the claim form on what is generally known as the “just and equitable” ground. The judge granted Mr Parr permission to appeal to this court.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Parr was born in 1958. He had a long career at the accountancy firm which became the First Respondent, joining in 1982. He was promoted to salaried partner in 1988 and became an equity partner in 1995. At that time, the firm was a partnership subject to the Partnership Act 1890. It became a limited liability partnership (“LLP”) in 2005. Mr Parr became a member of the LLP and retained the status of equity partner under the LLP membership agreement (“the Members’ Agreement”). At the times material to this claim, Simon Gallagher, the Second Respondent, was the Managing Partner. The Third to Eighth Respondents were the members of the Partnership Committee. </p>

The Managing Partner may only agree to such an extension where he objectively considers that there is a valid business case for so doing, having reference to the on-going contribution to the LLP Business by the Member concerned and the matters set out at clause 29.5. Any agreed extension shall be for a specific period of time, the conclusion of which will represent the Member’s Normal Retirement Date and shall be on such terms as to remuneration and otherwise the Managing Partner may determine.

Mr Gallagher recommended to the Partnership Committee that the Appellant be permitted to remain as a member of the LLP for two years beyond his Normal Retirement Date, i.e. until 30 April 2020, but not as an Equity Partner. Mr Gallagher’s evidence was that although he considered that there was a case for the Appellant to continue with the firm beyond his Normal Retirement Date, he did not consider that the Appellant was contributing to the business as an Equity Partner should.

He was not given the option to remain as an Equity Partner. In those circumstances, he chose to remain as an ordinary Partner. Mr Gallagher’s evidence, which was not in dispute and was accepted by the ET, was that in at least three previous instances the discretion had been exercised differently so as to permit Equity Partners to continue as such after what would have been their Normal Retirement Date. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Claimant was dissatisfied at not being offered a further period as an Equity Partner. However, he took the view that the difference between his earnings as an Equity Partner and his future earnings as an ordinary Partner was not so significant as to cause him to take legal advice on his position. At around the time that the De-Equitisation Agreement was entered into, he believed that his loss would be a reduction in income of the order of £31,000 in the subsequent financial year. He considered, with that figure in mind, that any legal action he might take would cost a considerable amount of money in legal fees in comparison to the possible benefit from it. The ET accepted the Claimant’s evidence that when he entered into the De-Equitisation Agreement he knew that he would lose out but he did not anticipate the full extent of his potential losses, which were dependent on future events. </p>

He was repaid the capital sum which he had invested in the business. After that he was not required to make any further capital contributions and did not have the potential liabilities that he would have had as an Equity Partner. He accepted in his evidence to the ET that he knew the effect of the De-Equitisation Agreement was that he would also lose any right to distribution of capital profits. </p>

This was not something of which he had been aware when he entered into the De-Equitisation Agreement in October 2017. Mr Gallagher’s evidence, accepted by the ET, was that the First Respondent’s Management Board had made the decision to sell those parts of the business on 14 February 2018, that is to say several months after the Claimant’s De-Equitisation Agreement. Separately, a prospective merger with BDO was also initially explored at a meeting between the key personnel from both firms on 1 March 2018.

At about the same time, two parts of the First Respondent’s business – its wealth management division and a proprietary software product – were also sold to other buyers. Mr Parr’s case is that had he remained an Equity Partner his share of the proceeds would have been almost £3 million. Hence his issue of the ET claim in January 2019. </p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">I start my analysis by rejecting Mr Stilitz’s submission that the implementation of the De-Equitisation Agreement is properly to be described as a termination followed by a re-engagement. As Mr Cohen correctly submitted, the Claimant remained a member of the First Respondent throughout; his membership of the LLP was never terminated. This situation is not, in my judgment, the same in factual terms as those cases in which the present issue has been raised in the context of either a dismissal or there being no ongoing relationship between the parties, such as <span style="font-style:italic">Okoro v Taylor Woodrow Construction Ltd</span> [2012] EWCA Civ 1590, [2013] ICR 580 (see at [36-37]). Rather, two important things happened after 30th April 2018, consequent upon the De-Equitisation Agreement. Firstly, the Claimant remained a member of the LLP but his status as a member changed from that of Equity Partner to that of ordinary Partner. Secondly, the future period of the Claimant’s membership of the LLP as an ordinary Partner, prior to retirement, was fixed at two years. The Employment Judge’s reference to what happened as a demotion captures the essence of what occurred: it is clear that the Claimant viewed the change in status from Equity Partner to ordinary Partner with a fixed term of two years as both undesirable and unwelcome.</p>

That provided for the norm to be the retirement of all Partners (i.e. not just Equity Partners) on the 30th April immediately following their 60th birthday. However, that was subject to a discretion on the part of the Managing Partner (subject to Partnership Committee approval) to disapply what would otherwise be the case, i.e. mandatory retirement as a Partner shortly after reaching the age of 60.</p>

The evidence before the Employment Judge, which she accepted, was that the discretion had previously been exercised to permit Equity Partners to remain at the firm in that capacity after they had reached what would have been their normal retirement age. This is not, therefore, a case in which there was a rule that no-one could continue as an Equity Partner after reaching what would otherwise be their normal retirement age. There was a genuine discretion, which had been exercised in a different way in other cases. As Mr Stilitz correctly submitted, on the Employment Judge’s findings of fact the matter was looked at on a case-by-case basis; in other instances the Equity Partner had continued as such beyond the age of 60.</p>

What occurred in this case was not, in my judgment, the application of a rule of the type referred to in those observations or a situation such as that in the cases of <span style="font-style:italic">Calder</span> or <span style="font-style:italic">Kapur</span> where such a rule continues to apply against a claimant with a resulting continuing discriminatory effect. There is a distinction between the continuing application of a discriminatory rule or policy to a claimant (such as in <span style="font-style:italic">Calder</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Kapur</span>) and the continued existence of such a rule or policy and its one-off application to a claimant. The effect of the De-Equitisation Agreement in this case was to make a one-off and permanent change to the Claimant’s status as a member of the LLP. The losses about which complaint is made in this Claim are derived not from the ongoing application of a general discriminatory rule relating to the payment of remuneration to a group of workers with a particular protected characteristic such as that seen in <span style="font-style:italic">Calder </span>or <span style="font-style:italic">Kapur</span>, but from the specific decision taken in the Claimant’s particular case to effect the one-off and permanent change in status brought about by the De-Equitisation Agreement. The Claim is based upon the change in the Claimant’s status from Equity Partner to ordinary Partner, and the alleged losses derive from that event. That took place with effect from 30th April 2018 and which was the product of the way in which the discretion in Clause 29.4 of the Members’ Agreement was exercised in the Claimant’s individual case.</p>

That the discretion in Clause 29.4 itself resulted from and was exercised because of the existence of the underlying normal retirement age does not, in my judgment, result in there having been a discriminatory rule in operation throughout so that any discriminatory conduct consequent upon the exercise of that discretion, insofar as the Claimant’s change in status was concerned, would have extended throughout the entire period of two years from 30th April 2018 when (but for the merger with BDO in 2019) the Claimant would have continued to have the lesser status of ordinary Partner.</p>

That the change in the Claimant’s status after 30th April 2018 may ultimately have derived from the operation of Clause 29 of the Members’ Agreement is not a material distinction because that Clause, properly construed and in light of the evidence as to its operation in practice, did not constitute a rule that Equity Partners could not continue as such after reaching the age of 60 and, in any event, the Claim is about the application of an allegedly discriminatory rule to the Claimant on a single occasion (i.e. through the De-Equitisation Agreement) rather than on a continuing basis. What is in issue for present purposes is not, therefore, the continuing application of a rule, but the operation of the discretion in the particular circumstances of the Claimant’s case.</p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In my judgment, the Employment Judge erred in her approach at paragraphs 75 and 76 of the written Reasons when she found that the Claimant’s demotion from Equity Partner to ordinary Partner was the result of the operation of a discriminatory rule which continued, and which amounted to continuing conduct for the purpose of section 123(3)(a) of the Equality Act 2010, whilst Clause 29 of the Members’ Agreement remained in effect. The Respondents did not operate a rule resulting in demotion at age 60; the Claimant’s demotion was the product of the one-off exercise of discretion under Clause 29.4 of the Members’ Agreement in the Claimant’s particular case. The Claimant might, permissibly under Clause 29, have been offered an extension to the period of his Equity Partnership (as had, on the evidence before the Employment Judge, other Equity Partners who had reached the age of 60) - but, in the event, he was not. There was, however, contrary to the Employment Judge’s finding at paragraph 76 of the written Reasons, no rule in operation preventing the Claimant’s continuation as an Equity Partner after 30th April 2018. That the discretion itself derives from the presence of the normal retirement age in Clause 29.2 does not result in there being a discriminatory rule in operation beyond the date at which the change in the Claimant’s status from Equity Partner to ordinary Partner took effect.”</p>

But on 13 October 1975 a man was appointed instead. On 29 December 1975 the relevant provisions of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 came into force and on 1 January 1976 the applicant made a complaint to an industrial tribunal that by appointing a man the employers had discriminated against her by reason of her sex contrary to the provisions of the Act of 1975. The industrial tribunal held that they had no jurisdiction to hear the complaint as the act of discrimination, namely, the failure to appoint her to the post, had occurred before the Act came into force. The Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the appeal [<span style="font-style:italic">sic</span>] and rejected a submission that the act of discrimination was an act extending over a period within the meaning of section 76(6)(b) of the Act of 1975 which is in identical terms to section 68(7)(b) of the Act of 1976. In giving the decision of the tribunal Bristow J. said, at p. 311:</p>

                <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.28in">“Like any other discrimination by act or omission, the failure to appoint her, and the appointment of him, must have continuing consequences. She is not the head of the department; he has been ever since 13 October 1975. But it is the consequences of the appointment which are the continuing element in the situation, not the appointment itself …. So, if the employers operated a rule that the position of head of department was open to men only, for as long as the rule was in operation there would be a continuing discrimination and anyone considering herself to have been discriminated against because of the rule would have three months from the time when the rule was abrogated within which to bring the complaint. In contrast, in the applicant's case clearly the time runs from the date of appointment of her male rival. There was no continuing rule which prevented her appointment. It is the omission to appoint her and the appointment of him which is the subject of her complaint.”</p>

She left her employment in October 1981 and within three months of the termination of the employment she complained that her employers had discriminated against her by refusing her a mortgage subsidy because she was a woman. The industrial tribunal were satisfied that she had been discriminated against because she was a woman but held that they had no jurisdiction to entertain the complaint because it had not been made within three months of the date upon which she had last been refused a mortgage in May 1981.</p>

Alternatively it could be said that so long as her employment continued, the employers were subjecting her to ‘any other detriment’ within section 6(2)(b). Once this conclusion is reached, in our judgment it follows that the case does not fall within section 76(6)(b). The rule of the scheme constituted a discriminatory act extending over the period of her employment and is therefore to be treated as having been done at the end of her employment.

Nor can it be entirely irrelevant that the rule in question was re-negotiated comparatively recently between the partners.

This provided that where the inclusion of any term in a contract rendered the making of the contract an unlawful act, the act was to be treated as extending throughout the duration of the contract. But it seems to me a startling proposition to say that the inclusion of a mandatory retirement age clause in a contract, whether of employment or partnership, renders the making of the contract an unlawful act. For this reason among others I do not think that the old s 68(7)(a) is of any assistance in answering the question raised by the present case.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Stilitz submits that the present case was a straightforward example of a one-off act with continuing consequences. Mr Parr asked for his equity partnership to be extended.  MSR declined to do so, and so his equity partnership came to an end.  Whether or not that refusal amounted to unlawful age discrimination, that was the end of the matter.  The fact that MSR exercised its discretion to continue to engage Mr Parr as a non-equity partner had nothing whatsoever to do with the discrimination alleged.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whether one characterises the alleged discrimination as a demotion, a termination and re-engagement, or the exercise of a discretionary power, it was a one-off act.  When Mr Parr’s request for an extension of his equity partnership was refused he entered into the De-Equitisation Agreement in October 2017, under which he would become an ordinary partner.  The De-Equitisation Agreement had the effect of terminating his equity partnership, once and for all, on 30 April 2018.</p>

There was nothing inevitable in the present case about Mr Parr’s equity partnership being terminated.

He submits that after 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>May 2018 clause 29.2 was no longer “in action” in Mr Parr’s case. This was not a case of someone who re-applied to become an equity partner and received a series of refusals.

The matter can be further tested by taking the case of an employer who before the Act was passed paid lower wages to his coloured employees than to his white employees. Once the Act came into force the employer would be guilty of racial discrimination if he did not pay the same wages to both coloured and white employees. If he continued to pay lower wages to the coloured employees it would be a continuing act lasting throughout the period of a coloured employee's employment within the meaning of subsection (7)(b). A man works not only for his current wage but also for his pension and to require him to work on less favourable terms as to pension is as much a continuing act as to require him to work for lower current wages.”</p>

The applicant was a black staff nurse. She complained of being given an E grading in October 1988 while in February 1989 a white nurse who was her chosen comparator was upgraded to F. Her industrial tribunal claim for racial discrimination was not presented until May 1990. It was held by this court that the act complained of was that the respondent authority had refused to upgrade the applicant while upgrading her comparator, not that it operated a policy or rule never to upgrade black nurses. The discriminatory act was a once-for-all event (occurring at the latest on the dismissal of her internal appeal), and the payment of a lower salary to her than that paid to her comparator was therefore not an “act extending over a period” within the meaning of s 68(7)(b) but the continuing consequence of that event.

It is artificial to divorce Clause 29.2 from Clause 29.4 and to ignore the evidence that some equity partners were allowed to continue in post beyond the age of 60. The case law does draw a distinction, at any rate when analysing whether the conduct complained of is an “act extending over a period”, between a rule, policy or practice which inevitably leads to the rejection of the claimant and one which involves (in practice and not just on paper) the exercise of a discretion. As Brooke LJ put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Rovenska v General Medical Council</span> [1998] ICR 85 at 92, “….[T]he courts have held that, if an employer adopts a policy which means that a black employee or a female employee is <span style="font-style:italic">inevitably</span> barred from access to valuable benefits, this is a continuing act of discrimination against employees who fall into these categories until the offending policy is abrogated” [emphasis added].  </p>

But Ms Amies herself lost her case, because there was no such policy. ILEA’s failure to promote her was a one-off act, albeit with continuing financial consequences.

On the other side of the line are the absolute rule cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Calder, </span>where the mortgage subsidy was only available to men, and <span style="font-style:italic">Kapur</span>, where Barclays’ employees of African ethnicity were working on less favourable pension terms than their white comparators.

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I do not accept that the judge misunderstood or misapplied <span style="font-style:italic">Tyagi. </span>Of course it was easy to see in that case that there was no continuing act, since the contractual relationship between Mr Tyagi and the BBC had ceased altogether. But, to adopt Brooke LJ’s phrase, which I regard as a useful one, I do not consider that Clause 29.2 was any longer “in action” vis-à-vis Mr Parr after his de-equitisation had taken place on 30 April 2018.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Like the judge in the EAT I have reached this conclusion without reference to considerations of policy, but in my view there is force in Mr Stilitz’s argument that if Mr Cohen is right, the result would be to encourage greater ruthlessness by partnerships and LLPs in making sure that a retirement age clause is put into effect so as to terminate the relationship altogether rather than allowing the former equity partner to continue in the lesser status of salaried partner, since to do the latter would leave the partnership exposed to a discrimination claim for as long as any contractual relationship existed between the parties.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I would accordingly dismiss the appeal. In accordance with the judge’s order in the EAT, the case will now be remitted for Employment Judge Elliott (if she is available) to decide whether it is just and equitable to extend time for the presentation of the claim.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I add by way of footnote that it is unfortunate that the ET, having heard argument on both “conduct extending over a period” and the “just and equitable” issue and decided the first one in the Claimant’s favour, did not go on to decide the second issue in the alternative in case (as has happened) the decision on the first issue was reversed on appeal. This case illustrates the wisdom of the observation of Lord Scarman in <span style="font-style:italic">Tilling v Whiteman </span>[1980] AC 1 at 25 that preliminary points of law can often be treacherous short cuts.</p>
