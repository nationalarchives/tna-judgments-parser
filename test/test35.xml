It was also the case that the termination provision stated ‘</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">This guarantee shall be a continuing security and shall remain in force …until determined by three months’ notice in writing”. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The relevant guarantee also expressly provided for what was to be preserved from the effect of termination: “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">…[B]ut such determination shall not affect the liability of the guarantor for the amount due hereunder at the date of expiration of the notice with interest as herein provided until payment in full”. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">The Court of Appeal placed reliance on this express wording in concluding that there could be no continuing exposure to contingent debts after termination had taken effect.

The subject matter of the guarantee is thus the payment of an identified debt or the discharge of the principal's liability in respect of an identified transaction. The liability of the surety is not, as such, qualified in amount or time; a further term is necessary to do that. The liability of the surety to the creditor accrues and becomes actionable as soon as there is a default by the principal. Any repayments by the principal will reduce or extinguish the obligation the subject of the guarantee and therefore the liability of the surety.

But still the two elements will be identifiable—the obligation or obligations of the principal the subject matter of the guarantee and the accrual of the liability of the surety to the creditor. Where the creditor and principal have a running account and the creditor, the bank, is from time to time providing the principal debtor with finance, whether by granting him overdrafts or loan facilities or issuing paper on his behalf or discounting negotiable and other instruments or debts for him or in any of the other many ways a banker may provide finance to a business, the only satisfactory form of guarantee will be what is called a continuing guarantee. This has the effect of making the subject matter of the guarantee whatever may be the discharge of the indebtedness (and other monetary obligations) of the principal to the bank at any given time. It is in essence a security with a floating subject matter. Ordinarily such a guarantee will not prudently be given unless the surety has a measure of control over the affairs of the principal.</span></p>

The mechanism ordinarily adopted is to express the guarantee as a demand guarantee. Thus, as does the present document, the guarantee will provide that the obligation of the surety arises when a demand is made upon him by the creditor. That demand provides the moment at which a line is drawn under the account between the principal and the creditor and the surety becomes immediately liable for the discharge of whatever are at that time the obligations of the principal to the creditor.</span></p>

The surety will normally require some mechanism whereby he can bring this state of affairs to an end. Commercially, there is more than one way in which he can do this. One is by including in the guarantee a provision which enables the surety to give notice of termination of the guarantee contract so that the creditor is given a period of time within which he may if he chooses make a demand upon the surety; if he does not do so, the contract then wholly comes to an end. This was held to be the effect of the guarantee in the </span><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Hardman</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> case. Another is by having a provision which enables the surety by the service of a notice to bring to an end the continuing character of the guarantee so that from the expiry of the notice its subject matter becomes the obligations of the principal to the creditor at that time. The judge has held that this is the effect of cl. 3 of the guarantee in the present case.</span></p>

It remains a demand guarantee so that, although the notice crystallises the subject matter of the guarantee, it leaves open whether there will be any liability of the surety under the guarantee. No cause of action against the surety will arise until a demand is made upon him. But the demand can only relate to such of the obligations of the principal at the time of the expiry of the notice as still remain unperformed at the time of the demand on the surety.</span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.29in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">In my judgment construction of the term “liability” is informed by other provisions of the Guarantee such as that setting a limitation on liability in clause 3 and the additional provisions regarding deferred sums that were unpaid during the continuance of earlier guarantees. Such provisions strongly support the conclusion that “liability” encompasses contingent liability in respect of sums regarding which payment has been deferred and which could be the subject of a demand by HMRC if not paid by MSL.  Thus, for example, clause 3(b) states that the overall liability of Euler is subject to a proviso that the advice of any default in payment has been received by HMRC’s bank not later than 7 days after default occurred. The “overall liability” figure may thus increase because of a delay in bank notification which suggests “liability” is concerned with exposoure to a potential demand by HMRC as a result of such bank notification of default.  See also the provisions of clause 6 which also provide for Euler’s “overall liability” to be increased in respect of sums deferred and not yet paid and which therefore amount to a contingent or potential liability for a gurantor.  </span></p>

Moreover, in this instance we are concerned with the deferral of the payment of taxes for which there is a statutory framework and obligation to collect. It would therefore seem unrealistic to conclude that a default by MSL, for example by its bank failing to meet a direct debit, would not result in a demand within a relatively short timescale by HMRC under the Guarantee, as has in fact happened.</span></p>

HMRC could afford more than a 7 days period of deferral (from the time periods referred to in the letter of demand it would appear 15 days deferral was in fact afforded to MSL). If the exposure of Euler could end within 7 days save in respect of sums demanded then HMRC might arguably have no recourse to the guarantor for sums for which payment was deferred during its validity but which had not yet fallen due. This would mean that in cases where this standard form of guarantee was used HMRC could only safely allow 7 days as a period of deferral. That would be an odd conclusion given that relevant statutory provisions governing deferral of payment to HMRC at the time envisaged longer periods of deferral (see the Customs Duties (Deferred Payment) Regulations 1976 SI 1976 1223, the Customs Duties (Deferred Payment) (Amendment) Regualtions 1978 SI 1978 No.1725 and Excise Duties (Deferred Payment) Regulations 1992 SI 1992 No.3152,  and EU Regulation No.952/2013 on the Union Customs Code (recast)).  </span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:left;margin-left:0.29in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I should add for completeness that Mr Quirk raised the argument that clause 6 of the Indemnity was invalid under the provisions of the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977. However, this was premised on there being no express or implied manifest error proviso to that clause. As I would have concluded that such a proviso did exist I do not understand this argument to be one that has any application. </span></p>
