Mother was reported as complaining she felt unsupported by Father, who was staying up late in the evening and then spending the day in bed. Father was referred to as “heavy handed” with the Child, not bonding with her and calling the Child unpleasant names. Mother said Father was staying up late in the evening and then spending the day in bed. While there, the Health Visitor observed a red mark to the Child’s lower leg as Mother was picking her up from her crib. She later recorded Mother’s explanation that a bottle of milk had fallen on the Child, and that when she asked to see the Child’s other leg Mother declined saying she did not want to disturb the Child. As the Child was being put back in the crib the Health Visitor observed another red mark to the left thigh. She made a referral and a child protection medical took place the same day, at which multiple bruises were identified as follows:</span></p>

She said Father had woken her at 4 in the morning, stating a bottle had fallen across the Child’s legs and might have been caused by the dog’s tail. Mother said that she had said to Father she would look at it in the morning, but then forgot until the health visitor’s visit. Because the bottle was quite big she questioned whether it could have caused the bruise around the hip area. Mother spoke about not enjoying the pregnancy, but enjoying being a mum and it having brought her out of a really dark place. She also spoke about having postnatal depression, but with no formal diagnosis. She stated the pregnancy was planned, and Father had proposed marriage when she was 20 weeks pregnant. She accepted she had discharged herself against advice because she does not like hospitals. She spoke about Father being a fantastic support with no concerns, other than gripes about leaving the wet towel on the floor or not putting dirty plates in the dishwasher. She said they had never raised a voice at one another, apart from the wet towel. She also spoke about him being a bit heavy-handed at times, but clarified this as the speed he would go to pick the Child up, and stated she would like to sell his XBox. Mother spoke about the Child being difficult to feed and aggressive with the feeding bottle. Father would apparently become frustrated with the Child and refer to her as “a little bugger”, but Mother said he would never swear at or to either the Child or her. She spoke her family being complete and being happy. The Child was described as sleeping between around about midnight until about half 6, and she stated Father had come off nights and initially doing the nightshifts with the Child, then alternating. She said the Child slept in their room in a Moses basket. She said she did not know why Father had taken the Child downstairs, but thought the dog had got a bit excited with daddy coming downstairs. Mother was shown photos of the bruising and accepting the marks were visible. She raised the possibility of the mark to the back being a birthmark. She was asked about the Paternal Aunt saying Father had better not have done anything to the baby, and said the Paternal Aunt was a very outspoken person and it was probably coming from Father having been the one watching the Child.</span></p>

He had apparently been gaming online and changing her when it occurred. He talked about the dog maybe brushing the Child’s arm when he jumped up with the bottle, but said he did not know whether the dog actually touched her because it happened very fast. He said that when it happened she instantly did what he described as a silent cry. He said he noticed a mark or marks on her legs and that he told Mother straightaway when she woke up in the morning (and later confirming this). Father was clear that he had checked the Child over that night and did not know where the other bruises were from. He stated he was sure Mother went downstairs and had a look. He then talked about waking up in the morning when the Health Visitor was there and coming downstairs to hear her say she would be speaking to her manager. Father talked about having a temper, but said he did not lose his temper easily. He confirmed it was a planned pregnancy, after 3 months of being together, and also talked about referring to the Child as “little bugger”, in an endearing way. He also spoke of Mother’s dislike of hospitals and accepting she had discharged against medical advice. He accepted sometimes getting frustrated with the Child, but said Mother and he agreed if either was getting frustrated the other would take over and given them a break. He had no concerns about Mother’s parenting at all. When asked about the comment made by the Paternal Aunt he said “she knows I have a temper but she knows that at the end of the day I can control it and it would never be taken out on a three week old baby that’s my flesh and blood and that I love dearly”.</span></p>

Further possibilities include faulty recollection or confusion at times of stress or when the importance of accuracy is not fully appreciated, or there may be inaccuracy or mistake in the record keeping or recollection of the person hearing or relaying the account. The possible effects of delay and repeated questioning upon memory should also be considered, as should the effect on one person of hearing accounts given by others.

It is also a tautology: the true distinction is between an accident which is unexpected and unintentional and an injury which involves an element of wrong. That element of wrong may involve a lack of care and/or an intent of a greater or lesser degree that may amount to negligence, recklessness or deliberate infliction. While an analysis of that kind may be helpful to distinguish deliberate infliction from say negligence, it is unnecessary in any consideration of whether the threshold criteria are satisfied because what the statute requires is something different namely, findings of fact that at least satisfy the significant harm, attributability and objective standard of care elements of section 31(2)."</span></p>

Plainly, the threshold criteria can be established by findings that a child has suffered harm whilst in the care of his parents, or other carers, without the need to establish precisely who caused the injuries. Nevertheless, where possible, and for the consideration of a child’s welfare, it is desirable to identify who has and who has not caused the injuries.</span></p>

He had asked his sister to look after the Child on 24 October because Mother was upset that she may have post-natal depression. On the night of 26/27 October 2021 he stated the Child had been sleeping in her travel cot, Mother having gone to bed at approximately 11pm.

He said the dog had jumped up in excitement right over the Child and he realised the spray bottle had fallen onto the Child’s legs. He reported pushing the dog off the sofa, picking up the bottle and placing it back on the side. He said it was possible the dog had trampled the Child. The Child was reported to have been crying and he settled her. At around 4am he said he went up to the bedroom and woke Mother up, vaguely explained to Mother what had happened and asked her to check the Child over. Later that day he said he had awoken to a commotion downstairs and he saw the Health (Visitor) storming out of the house and Mother crying. Mother advised him the Health (Visitor) had told her the Child should be taken to hospital and Mother had said she did not feel there was any need. Later that afternoon he stated a police detective had rung Mother and informed her either she could take the Child to hospital or she would be made subject to a Police Protection Order. He repeated that he had given Mother limited information at 4am, when she was half asleep. He also characterised the family members caring for the Child as because they were excited to spend time with and care for her.</span></p>

He accepted Dr S’s diagnosis of bruising. He explained a bruise is the escape of blood from ruptured blood vessels. To rupture the blood vessels would need an impact, twisting or gripping force. He did not think a nappy or car seat would cause a bruise unless it was extremely tight, in which case the child would cry out from distress and it would be a memorable event. “Memorable event” was a consistent theme when asked about possible alternative causes, being clear he would expect a credible account of the event and aftermath. He spoke about the lack of detail in explanations being put forward by the parents and that without detail he could not apply forensic analysis. He also said Father’s statement the dog may have trampled on the Child was an inadequate account of a memorable event. While he accepted the calf bruising could have been consistent with being caused by the dog, he pointed to the lack of history and said it was unlikely. He was clear he would have expected the parents to take medical advice, even at 4am, if the dog had trampled on the baby and bruising had been caused. Forensically he explained where injuries are inflicted the carer tends to wait to seek advice in the hope there would be improvement, whereas with accidents advice is normally sought immediately.</span></p>

She confirmed she had not met Father and had been told, on both visits, that he was upstairs sleeping. At her first visit, on 12 October, she had no recollection of Mother mentioning any injury to the Child’s ear.

She said she had felt pressured to talk to the Health Visitor about things she was not comfortable with, although this was not in her witness statement. She confirmed bathing the Child on the evening of 26 October 2021 and not seeing any injuries. She said Father had woken her at 4am, and the Child had been downstairs with Father before that. He had apparently informed her a bottle had fallen across the Child’s legs and she had a quick scan for injury. She said she was still half asleep and did not fully recall the conversation. The following morning she said she had checked the Child and there were 2 red marks, to the calf and thigh, despite telling the police she had forgotten about the incident. She did not ask Father for more information because he had been asleep until the Health Visitor left. She apparently thought about asking the Health Visitor to check the marks, but said the Child was settled and not in any discomfort. When the Health visitor saw the first bruise Mother stated she told the Health Visitor there was a second.</span></p>

When asked about hearing Father had called the Child an attention seeking whore she sought to answer an earlier question. When asked again she said she had been extremely shocked and ashamed it had come out of her son’s mouth. However, she also said she had not heard Father say it. She accepted it had stuck in her memory for a while and she knew Father calling the Child names was a concern, but said she had not remembered he called the Child that when asked about names the previous week. She later said she had not said about it because she had not heard him say it, she had just been told he said it. She did not regard the family meeting as unusual and had not felt a need to mention it before. She accepted calling the Child an attention seeking whore had probably not been mentioned in witness statements or oral evidence because they thought it would be quite damning for Father. She accepted withholding the information, but denied an agreement within the family to do so. She agreed withholding that particular name was coincidental. She categorised it as a flippant remark, then said it was not directed at the Child. </span></p>

He then claimed trouble hearing and he had been told by the Maternal Grandmother about 5 minutes later. He also said he had trouble with his memory and could not recall everything that was discussed, including whether they had discussed Father’s temper. He also said he had forgotten the attention seeking whore comment until Mother had said it in evidence on the Monday. He said he recalled the word c*** being bandied about.

She said it had slipped her mind, but accepted there had been a family meeting on 3 January 2022. She could not recall her reaction when Father admitted calling the Child an attention seeking whore. She continued to refer to parts of the proceedings as a bit pathetic. She spoke about there being an agenda from the beginning and a vendetta. When it was pointed out that the proceedings had discovered how Father spoke of the Child, that Father had regularly been abusive to Mother, that Father has a temper and throws things at the wall and the parents’ relationship was unhealthy, she called the Guardian’s advocate patronising and rude. She described Father’s admissions to the family making a decision to withhold information as trying to protect Mother. However, by the end of her evidence she accepted there was a risk for the Child to go back into the home environment.</span></p>

The Court was informed that in addition to other attendees a member of the extended family who works for Social Services was also in attendance. The Court would not regard the simple fact of the family having a meeting as unusual. Meetings are often called with the family by Social Services to discuss what options there are and what support may be available for the parents. What is concerning is that the meeting included discussions about concerns with the parents and none of the parties attending that meeting disclosed those concerns to the police, the Local Authority or the Court until Mother went back into the witness box.</span></p>

Once a lie is told it is hard to un-tell or own up to. Lies may be told on the spur of the moment in a flush of panic without much forethought, but owning up to a lie requires a cold, calculated decision. Owning up to the lie may be against a person’s own interests. However, it can be psychologically beneficial. Once you have told a lie about someone else it can be harder to admit you have lied, and are therefore a liar, than to maintain that you have been honest. </span></p>

However, the vehemence with which they sought to defend the parents and criticise the authorities displayed a confirmation bias – they had made up their minds and then sought to promote a case which fitted this – which completely ignored what they knew about the situation in the family home.</span></p>

If not, which of those people is there a likelihood or real possibility caused the injury? Father only – there is no evidence Mother was aware before the morning of 28 October 2021 and the Child was dressed in a vest, so there was no evidence of cover up.</span></p>

The Maternal grandmother had been told about Father’s name calling of Mother. The Paternal family knew of Father’s temper. They supported the placement of the Child with the parents because they knew there were problems. Mother was aware of the issues with Father and put her relationship with Father above the safety of the Child. The child was exposed to a domestically abusive and volatile relationship, which included controlling behaviour exhibited by the father, as a consequence.</span></p>

No. They all lied and the excuses would be risible if the matter were not so serious. They each failed to work openly and honestly with professionals and the court, and their motive in withholding relevant information in respect of the parental relationship and the father calling the child ‘an attention seeking whore’ was to protect the parents, thereby prioritising the parents over and above the child’s need for protection and in order to prevent the full detail of the child’s lived experiences and the risks posed to her being shared with professionals and the court. </span></p>
