          <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Following a referendum, various provisions of the Government of Wales Act 2006 (“the 2006 Act”) came into force on 5 May 2011. These provisions gave the National Assembly for Wales (“the Assembly”) primary legislative competence in certain areas </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[5]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. If there is an issue as to whether a Bill, or a provision in a Bill, passed by the Assembly exceeds legislative competence, the issue can be referred to the Supreme Court </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[6]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">.</span></p>

        <content>
          <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">The Local Government Byelaws (Wales) Bill 2012 (“the Bill”) was the first Bill to be enacted by the Assembly under these new powers. The aim of the Bill is to simplify procedures for making and enforcing local authority byelaws in Wales </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[7]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. Certain provisions of the Bill are intended to remove the need for the confirmation of byelaws by the Welsh Ministers and by the Secretary of State </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[8]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. This need arises by virtue of the Local Government Act 1972 (“the 1972 Act”) and the National Assembly for Wales (Transfer of Functions) Order 1999 (“the 1999 Order”). The effect of section 236(11) of the 1972 Act is that, where a statutory provision giving a local authority the power or duty to make the byelaw either so provides or is silent as to the existence or identity of a confirmatory body or person, before any byelaw made under that provision by a local authority can be effective, the Secretary of State has to confirm the byelaw </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[16]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. Schedule 1 to the 1999 Order provides that the functions of the Secretary of State under section 236(11) of the 1972 Act “shall be exercisable by the Assembly concurrently with the Secretary of State” </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[20]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">.</span></p>

          <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">The Attorney General referred to the Supreme Court the question whether sections 6 and 9 of the Bill were within the Assembly’s legislative competence </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[1]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. Section 6 of the Bill (through Part 1 of Schedule 1 to the Bill) removes the need for the confirmation of byelaws under certain specific enactments (“the scheduled enactments”) which currently require confirmation under section 236(11) of the 1972 Act. Section 9 would empower the Welsh Ministers to add to the scheduled enactments </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[8]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. The specific issue in relation to sections 6 and 9 was whether either section removed the Secretary of State’s role in confirming (or refusing to confirm) byelaws made under statutory provisions which are (i) scheduled enactments, and (ii) provisions to which section 236(11) applies. If either section removed this role, they would be beyond the legislative competence of the Assembly, unless they were “incidental to, or consequential on” another provision contained in the Bill </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[46]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">.</span></p>

        <content>
          <p class="Default" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Section 6 is within the legislative competence of the Assembly </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[66],[83]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. The removal of the Secretary of State’s confirmatory powers in relation to the scheduled enactments would be incidental to, and consequential on, the primary purpose of removing the need for confirmation by the Welsh Ministers of any byelaw made under the scheduled enactments </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[52],[53]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. The primary purpose of the Bill cannot be achieved without that removal </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[54]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. The Secretary of State’s confirmatory power is concurrent with that of the Welsh Ministers </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[55]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. It is open to either the Secretary of State or the Assembly to exercise any functions which are exercisable concurrently </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[37]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. Where a function is vested in two Ministers concurrently, either may perform it, acting alone, on any occasion </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[40]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. It is far more sensible and consistent with the purpose of the Welsh Government legislation to conclude that the Assembly and the Secretary of State were each intended to have the power to exercise the concurrent functions, and that it was to be left to their good sense to decide which should exercise a particular function in a particular case </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[41]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. The confirmatory power is only given to the Secretary of State if no other statute (including one passed after the 1972 Act) confers the function on any other body or person, which supports the notion that it is not an important function </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[56]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. The scheduled enactments relate to byelaws in respect of which the Secretary of State is very unlikely ever to exercise his confirmatory power </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[57]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">.</span></p>

          <p class="Default" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">Section 9 is within the legislative competence of the Assembly </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[66],[84]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. Section 9 has a limited effect, because the jurisdiction of the Assembly is limited to removing, or delegating the power to remove, functions of the Secretary of State where this would be incidental to, or consequential on, the purpose of removing the need for confirmation by the Welsh Ministers of any byelaw made under the scheduled enactments, and the Assembly cannot therefore bestow wider powers than this on the Welsh Ministers </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[63]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. The same conclusion can be arrived at by invoking section 154(2) of the 2006 Act, which provides that a provision of a Bill which could be read in a way as to be outside the Assembly’s legislative competence is to be read as narrowly as is required for it to be within that competence </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[64]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">.</span></p>

          <p class="Default" style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:13pt">The outcome of this reference is in favour of the Assembly, but it cannot be regarded as a setback in practical terms for the Secretary of State, because the conclusion the Supreme Court has reached as to the effect of section 9 of the Bill is one which reflects the terms on which the Secretary of State was prepared to give consent to section 6 of the Bill </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[67]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">. The outcome is also entirely consistent with the general thrust of the extended powers given to the Welsh Ministers by the 2006 Act </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-size:13pt">[68]</span><span style="font-size:13pt">.</span></p>

As no form has been laid down for use in the case of references (as opposed to appeals) involving devolution issues, it is open to the referring law officer or court to adopt whatever style and layout is thought to be most appropriate in the circumstances.
