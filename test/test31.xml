            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">On 19 December 2018 Mr Besim Sylaj fell to his death from the fifth floor balcony of his home in Westbourne Grove in London.  Mrs Fatmire Gorani, the widow of the deceased and the Claimant in these proceedings, brings this claim for judicial review, challenging the conduct, findings and conclusion of the defendant, the Assistant Coroner for Inner West London, (hereafter “the Coroner”) at the inquest into the death of her husband. The Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, (“the NHS Trust”), which was the health authority responsible for Mr Sylaj’s medical care, and Dr Samantha Sanghera, a locum GP at his GP practice, are Interested Parties.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">The coroner is a judicial office holder.  The normal course for a judge or other judicial office-holder facing a judicial review is to adopt a neutral stance in the proceedings and to appear, if at all, not as a party to defend her decisions, but simply to offer the court her assistance on matters of procedure or specialist caselaw.  By contrast, the Coroner here has not only appeared by counsel to oppose the application, but has submitted a witness statement in support of her case.  No objection was taken by the claimant to the coroner adopting this cause. But a coroner who choses to enter the arena in this way puts herself at risk of a costs order against her should the claim succeed (see <span style="font-style:italic">R (Davis) (No 2) v HM Deputy Coroner for Birmingham </span>[2004] 1 WLR 2739 at [47(ii)]). </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">I have approached the coroner’s witness statement with a little caution.  When allegations of bias are made, as they are here, a court may consider the explanation of the judge (or coroner); see <span style="font-style:italic">R (Pounder) v HM Deputy Coroner for the North and South Districts of Durham and Darlington</span> [2010] EWHC 328 (Admin), at [12].  But the coroner’s witness statement does not address the question of bias.  Instead, she seeks to explain her reasoning and to respond to the grant of permission to bring the proceedings.  A coroner’s reasoning ought to be apparent from her decision.  The court would only resort to some <span style="font-style:italic">ex post facto</span> explanation if the circumstances made that essential (compare <span style="font-style:italic">R (D) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> [2003] EWHC155 (Admin) at [18]).  It has not been necessary to have regard to the coroner’s statement in this case.</p>

The coroner responded by referring to her earlier decision and to the fact that Mr Sylaj had had face to face contact with a GP, after the contact with the SPA, and that that GP, Dr Sanghera, did not suggest he was at risk of suicide or self harm.  But she said that she would keep the matter under review. </p>

It was submitted that there was a system failure on the 12th December 2019 when the deceased was unable to speak to a clinician at the SPA, because of a lack of an available clinician, and his telephone number was not taken to ensure a clinician could ring him back.  It was argued that Mr Sylaj should have been viewed as especially vulnerable and at risk of suicide. The submissions also highlighted the fact that, absent an Article 2 ruling, the family would be unrepresented at an inquest where they allege arguable breaches of Article 2 right to life and that the other parties would be legally represented. </p>

In consequence, pursuant to s.5(2) of the 2009 Act, it was necessary for the Defendant to determine not only who the deceased was, how, when and where he died, but also “<span style="font-style:italic">in what circumstances</span>” Mr Sylaj came by his death.

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">In passing, I would express some surprise that the Coroner held that any of the events surrounding this death engaged Article 2 of the ECHR.  It is far from obvious why the events on the 12 December 2018 engaged the state’s systems duty, even arguably.  The systems duty is a “<span style="font-style:italic">high level structural duty</span>” rather than an obligation of result (see <span style="font-style:italic">R (Gardner) v Secretary of State for Health and Social Care</span> [2022] EWHC 967 Admin) at [226]).

Police attended and pronounced the death to be nonsuspicious. No note of intent was found. The pathologist gave the cause of death as multiple trauma. There was the presence of mirtazapine in his system at the time of his death. No other drugs, no alcohol in his system that would have influenced his behaviour or decision-making. There’s been an admitted failure by the Trust, and I was very pleased the family and Mr Rule praise Ms Cox for the rapidity with which they recognised what had gone wrong; the fact that they were open about what had gone wrong with the family; and that they, as quickly as possible, put in a process to safeguard a repeat of what went wrong. </p>

It’s a missed opportunity. It’s possible there may have been a referral to secondary mental-health services, but we know that he was seen by an experienced GP the following day who did not consider he needed referral to secondary mental-health services. If he’d been triaged by a clinician on the 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span>, there was quite a significant range of options available between referring back to the Home Treatment Team, and we know that his presentation on the 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December, when put to Dr Lowe, he felt it would be unlikely that the referral would reach the Home Treatment Team level. He could have been referred to community mental-health services, a community mental-health outpatient appointment, and we’ve looked at all the timelines. Without the triage, we don’t know what sort of timeline would necessarily he’d have followed for an assessment He could indeed have been referred to his GP, as he was when he had thoughts of self-harm and presented in a crisis to Dr Patel in February and was referred to St Mary’s and assessed by liaison psychiatry at that point.

He was directly asked if he had any thoughts of self-harm and he said no. He had never shown any disposition to be a risk of harm to others. And as to a risk of health, clearly, he was presenting as anxious and low mood because of a very specific matter which Dr Sanghera felt that she might be able to assist with by providing him with a letter, increasing his mirtazapine and referring him to psychological therapy, safety netting him, and providing him with a follow-up in a very traumatic meeting.”</p>

The obligation imposed by s5(2) requires an investigation “<span style="font-style:italic">where necessary</span>” to ensure compliance with the Convention. A coroner’s ruling as to the particular issues in respect of which Article 2 requires investigation delimits the scope of the Article 2 inquiry. Here, the scope of the investigation necessary to discharge the Article 2 obligation – namely to determine whether there was a breach of the system duty on 12 December – was never amended or challenged.  And it was on that issue that the coroner properly focused her conclusions.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">As to events on 12 December, the claimant criticises the coroner’s finding that “<span style="font-style:italic">it was not possible to say that if Mr Sylaj had been triaged it would have prevented his death</span>”.  But, as Mr Landau correctly submits, in determining that issue the coroner took into account all the relevant evidence before her.  She pointed out that the deceased was unlikely to have been referred to the HTT and might well have been referred back to his GP.  As she said, as it turned out, the deceased was assessed by Dr Sanghera the following day.  Furthermore, it was impossible to know how long it would have taken for the deceased to have been assessed for community mental-health services.  These were perfectly rational conclusions for the Coroner to reach on the evidence.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Mr Rule further argues that the Coroner failed properly to take into account relevant evidence, including the failure to refer the call received by the SPA to the HTT crisis team, failures of training within the SPA and insufficiency of clinician staffing levels in the SPA.  For two reasons, that argument goes nowhere.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">First, as Mr Landau submits, this evidence went to the issue of why the SPA failed to triage the deceased, not to whether, if the deceased had been triaged by the SPA, he would not have died.  Second, and more fundamentally, while the question of what is a relevant consideration is a question for a reviewing court, the matter of how much <span style="font-style:italic">weight</span> to apply to a relevant consideration is a matter for the decision-maker, a decision with which I would decline to interfere.  The Defendant’s decision in this case – that, based on the evidence before her, it was “<span style="font-style:italic">not possible to say [that] if [the deceased] had been triaged, it would have prevented his death</span>” – cannot sensibly be regarded as “perverse” or “absurd”.  The Defendant’s reasoning in the passage set out at [34] above is entirely cogent.</p>

It was open to the coroner to find that Dr Sanghera had given truthful evidence as to her clinical impression and judgment, that she did not consider the deceased to be at risk of deliberate self-harm and, in the light of the fact that he had a consultation with his regular GP, Dr Patel, arranged for 20 December 2018, as to the five-point plan she said she had formulated for his future care. These were conclusions on the facts which were properly open to the coroner.</p>
