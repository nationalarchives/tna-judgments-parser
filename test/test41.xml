            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">This is the damages inquiry following the decision of David Stone (sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge) dated 5<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2020 (<span style="font-style:italic">Geofabrics Ltd v Fiberweb Geosynthetics Ltd </span>[2020] EWHC 444 (Pat)) in which he found the Defendant liable for infringement of European Patent (UK) EP 2 430 238. The Defendant appealed that finding, but Mr Stone’s decision was upheld by the Court of Appeal on 11 June 2021 (<span style="font-style:italic">Geofabrics Ltd v Fiberweb Geosynthetics Ltd </span>[2021] EWCA Civ 854). </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">At the inquiry, the Claimant was represented by Mr Michael Hicks and the Defendant was represented by Dr Geoffrey Pritchard, Mr Charles Brabin and Ms Alice Hart. Dr Pritchard undertook the bulk of the oral advocacy for the Defendant, but each of Mr Brabin and Ms Hart addressed me on a discrete point of argument in closing. Parties are encouraged to look for opportunities to enable junior counsel to undertake oral advocacy in this way.  I am grateful to counsel on both sides for their helpful submissions. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The technical background to the patent is conveniently summarised in Mr Stone’s judgment at [5]-[11], to which the reader is referred. In summary, the patent concerns a geosynthetic trackbed liner (also sometimes called an anti-pumping geocomposite) that sits as a geotextile layer between the soil (or subgrade) and the ballast underneath railway tracks. It is used to ameliorate a problem known as “pumping erosion” that is seen with clay subgrades. This is a well-known problem caused by water, clay and silt leaching out of the subgrade by the weight of the train as it travels over the track. Over time, removal of clay and silt causes erosion to the trackbed and settling of the track, which requires remediation. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The problem of pumping erosion had previously been addressed by using a layer of sand (a “sand blanket”) between the subgrade and the ballast, but this was expensive and inconvenient to lay. In 2010 the Claimant launched its geocomposite product, Tracktex, as an alternative to a sand blanket (although sand remains approved for use as geocomposites are not suitable for all rail lines). A geocomposite has several advantages over a sand blanket which are said to make it commercially and environmentally attractive, including lower materials costs and lower costs of installation, and less track downtime required to install it. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Defendant launched its rival product, Hydrotex 2, in July 2012. Hydrotex 2 was found to infringe the patent. It was on the market until June 2021, when the Court of Appeal dismissed the Defendant’s appeal and the stay of the injunction ordered by Mr Stone pending appeal came to an end. In May 2021, the Defendant introduced a replacement for Hydrotex 2 called Hydrotex 4. All sales of Hydrotex 4 are deemed licensed and so are not relevant to this judgment. At all material times Tracktex and Hydrotex 2 were the only commercially available alternatives to a sand blanket.</p>

As Norris J said in <span style="font-style:italic">Servier</span>, even the most honest witness can innocently give self-serving evidence about what they would have intended or done in the counterfactual, with the result that this evidence must be assessed carefully by reference to whatever objective tools and evidence are to hand. However, in the same passage the judge warned that this assessment is not an opportunity for the court to construct its own hypothetical world out of the available materials in place of that argued by the parties.

Mr Hancock has worked for the Defendant (or its predecessors) since 1988 but did not get involved with rail sales until around 2007. He was promoted to Sales Director in November 2012, responsible for managing the Network Rail account. His title changed to Key Account Manager in 2014, but he remained responsible for the Network Rail account until 2015 when his role changed. He then had little involvement with UK rail sales until 2018. His evidence was that he did not have hands on involvement during this period, although he continued to have some awareness of matters relating to sales of Hydrotex and the operation of the 2014 tender (of which more below). </p>

I do not consider this to be a case where it is helpful or appropriate generally to “prefer” the evidence of one expert over another in the way that can sometimes be seen in respect of technical expert evidence in patent cases. Instead, I must approach each issue in turn, doing my best to determine what would have happened in the counterfactual by reference to the available evidence with respect to that issue.  That includes the evidence of what actually happened, the evidence of Mr Donald about what the Claimant’s intentions would have been (subject to the warnings given by Norris J in <span style="font-style:italic">Servier v Apotex</span> that I have referred to above), and the evidence of the experts (including, importantly, the reasons they give for their opinions). </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">It is convenient at this stage to note that both experts built detailed financial models which they used to calculate the overall damages figure based on their opinions of the suggested input parameters.  However, the parties agreed that it was not necessary for me to learn how to operate the models or to reach a determination of the final damages sum as part of this judgment. Instead, the parties will work with their experts to input the necessary parameters that arise from my decision into the models and agree the resulting figure. It may be necessary for me to give directions about this, and I will hear from counsel as to the appropriate way forward in due course. However, since the experts agreed on the methodology for doing the calculations, this should be a reasonably straightforward exercise and I am confident that the parties will co-operate effectively.  The only downside with this approach, at least from my perspective, is that I have not been able to sense check the consequences of my judgment in terms of the overall damages figure. This has felt rather uncomfortable but is the necessary consequence of the way in which the evidence was prepared and presented. </p>

The difference between them was that Counterfactual A was based on a situation where there was a Network Rail tender process in 2013 whereas Counterfactual B was based on a situation where there was no Network Rail tender process. The experts had considered these different counterfactual scenarios in their reports (although for reasons which are not clear Mr MacGregor termed them ‘But For Scenario A’ and ‘But For Scenario B’). Mr MacGregor also considered an additional counterfactual which he called ‘But For Scenario C’; this was also based on an assumed Network Rail tender process but differed in other details from But For Scenario A. The parties opening written arguments also addressed these different counterfactuals. </p>

Moreover a number of aspects of the claim show that damage can potentially be large even if an infringer's sales are comparatively low. I have in mind particularly the effect of price depression on the patentee's sales, lost profits when lost sales affect marginal profits, and the loss of sales of articles or services associated with the patented goods. and of course all these heads have their own uncertainties of quantification.</span></p>

Such an opportunity is a valuable right in itself, and what the claimant proves (on the balance of probabilities) is that he has lost that right; the assessment of the value of the right then depends on the chances of success. As Patten LJ says in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Vasiliou</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> at [21] this is because what has been lost is by definition the loss of a chance. It would obviously be wrong to value the right to take part in a competition at the value of the prize that might be won as the claimant never had a right to the prize, only the right to enter the competition. It would also be wrong to value the right to bring litigation as if it were bound to succeed, if, as is almost inevitably the case, the outcome of the litigation is uncertain. A claim with a prospect of success has a value, but until judgment has been obtained (and indeed it is clear that it can be successfully enforced) that value is not the same as the amount which would be awarded were it to succeed.</span></p>

In an </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Allied Maples</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> case the claimant has not lost a valuable right, but he has lost the opportunity of gaining a benefit, albeit one which depends on a third party acting in a particular way. In such a case the claimant is not required to prove that the third party would have acted in that way, only that there was a real and substantial chance that he would. This is still a question of causation, not of quantification (see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Vasiliou</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> at [22], and also </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">First Interstate Bank of California v Cohen Arnold &amp; Co</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> [1996] CLC 174 at 182 per Ward LJ, cited in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Vasiliou</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> at [43]); but if the claimant does establish that there was such a real and substantial chance, then when it come</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">[s]</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> to quantification, his damages will be assessed not at 100% of the value of the benefit he would have obtained, but at the appropriate percentage having regard to the chances of his obtaining it. I only add the obvious point that in some cases, where the chance is found to be say 30%, the requirement that the claimant only need show that he has lost a real and substantial chance is beneficial to him (as if he had to prove how the third party would have acted on the balance of probabilities, he would recover nothing); but in other cases, where the chance is assessed at say 70%, it has the effect of only enabling him to recover 70% of the damages he otherwise would. But as I read the authorities, the claimant does not have a choice whether to adopt the Allied Maples approach; if the case is an Allied Maples type of case, this is the appropriate way to approach the issues of causation and quantification.</span></p>

It is not entirely clear if this is part of the question of causation and a separate exercise from quantification; or whether it is to be regarded as part of the quantification exercise. Toulson LJ in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Parabola</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> at [23] fairly clearly treats the finding of Flaux J that “on a balance of probability Tangent would have traded profitably…” as part of the question of causation as he deals with it in the context of the claimant having first to establish an actionable head of loss, and coming before the “next task” which is “to quantify the loss”. On the other hand Patten LJ in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Vasiliou</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> at [23] seems to have regarded the question as part of the exercise of quantification: see his reference to there being “no doubt at all that the breach had caused the loss subject only to the quantification of that loss”, and to Mr Vasiliou’s competence and the restaurant’s prospects of success not being matters that went to causation at all but being relevant at most to the assessment of how profitable the restaurant would have been.</span></p>

              <p class="Cite" style="margin-left:0.6in;text-indent:0.4in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">On either view this is clearly a different type of exercise from that undertaken in an </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Allied Maples</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> case. It does not require the Court to find that there was a real and substantial chance of a third party acting in a particular way; but to reach a conclusion whether trading would have been profitable or not. However the exercise is characterised, I think it must follow that this is a simple yes/no question (would the trading have been profitable?), and hence falls to be decided on the balance of probabilities. I accept that this is so, even though as a matter of strict logic it is not entirely obvious why there should be such a sharp difference of approach from the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Allied Maples</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> type of case. The profitability of the restaurant in Vasiliou presumably depended on whether it would have attracted sufficient custom, or in other words whether a number of third parties would have chosen to come to Mr Vasiliou’s restaurant; and this does not seem very different in kind, only in degree, from the question in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Allied Maples</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> which was whether the third party in question would have chosen to accede to Allied Maples’ request for a particular contractual term. It may be that the difference is between one particular third party and a pool of potential customers; in the case of an individual third party, the Court must assess the chance of his acting in a particular way, but in the case of a pool of potential customers, the Court is not concerned with how any individual would have behaved but with whether there would have been sufficient custom generally to make the business a success.</span></p>

The correct picture of the law on proof in relation to damages is therefore that where the uncertainty is as to past fact, the ‘all or nothing balance of probabilities’ test applies. Where the uncertainty is as to the future, proportionate damages are appropriate. Where the uncertainty is as to hypothetical events, the correct test to be applied depends on the nature of the uncertainty: if it is uncertainty as to what the claimant would have done, the all or nothing balance of probabilities test applies; if it is as to what a third party would have done, damages are assessed proportionately according to the chances. For that general distinction between past fact and future or hypothetical events, see Mallett v McMonagle [1970] AC 166 at 176 (per Lord Dilock). That there is a contrast between the test applicable to what hypothetically the claimant would have done and what hypothetically a third party would have done emerges from cases such as Allied Maples Group Ltd v Simmons &amp; Simmons [1995] 1 WLR 1602, CA, and 4 Eng Ltd v Harper [2008] EWHC 915 (Ch), [2009] Ch 91, at [41] - [92].

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Tracktex was the first-in-class anti-pumping geocomposite product. The Defendant’s predecessor, Terram, had previously developed a product called Terram PW Geosand (Geosand) that was intended as an alternative to a sand blanket. Geosand comprised a thin layer of sand encased between two layers of bonded geotextile. It was approved by Network Rail sometime in about mid 2000 but was deemed to be too expensive and heavy to install and so was not a commercial success. It had a cost of about £28/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span>, as compared with a sand blanket that had a cost of about £25/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span>.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">As noted above, Tracktex has a number of perceived advantages over sand. These include (a) lower materials costs; (b) lower transportation costs; (c) lower installation costs; (d) lower removal costs; and (e) less track downtime to perform installation. In addition, a geotextile brings environmental advantages of decreased excavation depth (thereby reducing spoil for landfill and the volume of traffic involved in removing materials). Mr Donald gave evidence that he marketed these advantages to Network Rail as benefits of Tracktex. As he pointed out, since Network Rail adopted the product, it is only reasonable to assume that they accepted these benefits as genuine. This view is also supported by a document from Network Rail dated 18 October 2010 which shows the cost benefit of using Tracktex over a sand blanket (a Tracktex roll priced at £11.45/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> produced a cost saving of approximately £765,908 over a stretch of track of about 24km). Mr Donald also said that Network Rail told him that Tracktex reduced track possession time by about 33%. This can represent an even greater saving than the materials costs saving, as possession of a mainline typically costs approximately £200,000 per day.</p>

The terms included that the Claimant would supply Tracktex to Aqua exclusively for the mainland UK (but excluding N. Ireland) save in respect of Network Rail’s right to direct supply. The agreement could be terminated on 6 months’ notice by either party. The price for 2010 was £15/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> ex works.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">By late 2013, and even though the Claimant successfully challenged the First Tender, Mr Donald had formed the view that the Defendant would be likely to win the Second Tender. He realised that would effectively exclude the Claimant from making direct sales of Tracktex to Network Rail and mean that the only sales route available to it was via sub-contractors. He was concerned to ensure that the Claimant was not left without a route to market and recognised that Aqua was better placed than it was to maintain this line of Tracktex sales. In this context, in the MD Report of the Board Meeting of 23 September 2013, Mr Donald recorded as follows:</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">In addition, since Aqua was also the distributor of the Claimant’s other geotextile products which amounted to about 50% of the total business between them, he was concerned to protect that too, particularly considering the market conditions. In cross-examination he explained that if the Claimant lost the whole of the Aqua business, it would have had an “<span style="font-style:italic">existential</span>” impact on the Claimant. As a result, the Claimant could not take the risk of falling out with Aqua. It is important to remember, however, that one of the reasons why the non-Tracktex sales were so important at the time was because of the potential impact that Hydrotex 2 and the Second Tender were likely to have on the Tracktex side of the business. Mr Donald pointed out in cross-examination that in the counterfactual world where the Claimant had the additional Tracktex business, it would have been significantly further away from a loss-making position. </p>

He said he could not see a reason why the Claimant would not have continued to supply Network Rail direct, although it would have continued to use Aqua as its distributor for non-Network Rail sales (including to sub-contractors who then service Network Rail). He rejected the suggestion that the Claimant would have offered an exclusive distribution agreement to Aqua.

However, that rather misses the point. The question is not whether the direct supply agreement would ever have been put in place, since it was in the actual and is deemed to be so in the counterfactual. Instead, the question is whether the Claimant would have undone that arrangement in the counterfactual and replaced it with an exclusive distribution agreement with Aqua instead.  I cannot see why it would have been in the commercial interest of the Claimant to do that, particularly bearing in mind that direct sales of Tracktex to Network Rail commanded a higher price pursuant to the Network Rail price matrix (at least depending on the quantities sold). </p>

There is no doubt that it did. But the evidence showed that the Claimant had repeatedly made clear to Aqua that it had been Network Rail’s doing. I refer to the letter of 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2011, considered at paragraph 93 above. I also refer to the MD Report of the Board Meeting dated 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> March 2011, where Mr Donald records that Aqua were not pleased that the Claimant had entered into a direct supply arrangement with Network Rail but that he had stressed to Aqua that this was a Network Rail initiative. In cross-examination, Mr Donald said that Aqua felt that the Claimant “<span style="font-style:italic">had done the dirty on them</span>” which is why he had reassured them that it had come from Network Rail. </p>

It submitted that this was because Aqua was not prepared to wait until the outcome of the Second Tender and had put the Claimant under pressure for a more favourable solution. It referred to the MD Report of the Board Meeting of 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September 2013 where Mr Donald records that since the last Board Meeting, he had met with Aqua “<span style="font-style:italic">and definitely detected that the tactic of ‘wait and see’ was running out of time</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">and that we were in danger of losing position through Aqua in the rail distribution market</span>”. However, when Mr Donald was cross-examined about this, he explained that the “wait and see” tactic had come from the Claimant and not Aqua and had been devised to buy some time to assess the consequences of losing the First Tender whilst the tender challenge process was under way. He also made clear that the key pressure was competition from the Defendant in conjunction with market conditions at the time and losing the First Tender. This situation would not have occurred in the counterfactual where there would never have been competition from Hydrotex 2 or a tender process (even though the other market conditions would have been the same). Absent competition from the Defendant, the Claimant would not have needed to take remedial steps to ensure that it continued to have access to the market and retained Aqua’s loyalty to Tracktex.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Finally, in this context the Defendant referred to the fact that the Claimant has continued its exclusive relationship with Aqua to this day, even though the tender arrangement between Network Rail and the Defendant came to an end in July 2017 and the exclusive distribution agreement with Aqua had an initial term of only three years. The Defendant submitted that there has been nothing to stop the Claimant from selling direct to Network Rail and said it is telling that it appears not to have even tried. I do not think that there is anything in this point since it does not shed any light on what the Claimant would have done in the counterfactual. </p>

It contends that Aqua would have forced the Claimant to offer a deal, failing which it would have walked away “because the Tracktex game was no longer worth the commercial candle”. I have to say that I found this part of the Defendant’s case to be largely speculative and unsupported by evidence.

In particular, whilst there was clear evidence in the Claimant’s disclosure that Aqua were unhappy with the direct supply arrangement that Network Rail had imposed on the Claimant, there was no suggestion that Aqua were threatening to walk away from the situation or to stop distribution of Tracktex to non-Network Rail customers unless they had the benefit of complete exclusivity. To the contrary, as soon as the direct supply arrangement with Network Rail was imposed in 2011, the Claimant and Aqua were able to agree a new distribution arrangement with the pricing matrix set out above and which was to operate alongside the direct supply agreement between the Claimant and Network Rail. That arrangement was in place when Hydrotex 2 was launched in July 2012 and, as I understand it, remained in place until the December 2013 exclusive distribution agreement. Moreover, it was an arrangement that worked well. </p>

I have already explained above the reasons why that agreement was so important to the Claimant at the time, but apart from residual damage to their relationship arising out of the direct supply to Network Rail, none of those reasons would have materialised in the counterfactual. There was no evidence to explain any additional reasons why the agreement was important to Aqua or to suggest that Aqua had demanded it in the actual. To the contrary, when it was put to Mr Donald in cross-examination that it was Aqua that had pushed for the exclusive deal, he explained that it was the Claimant who had offered it, but that of course the exclusivity was mutual in the sense that Aqua only bought from the Claimant and the Claimant only supplied to Aqua. That evidence was supported by the MD Report of the Board Meeting of 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> September 2013, which recorded that Mr Donald had initiated discussions with Aqua about a longer-term partnership and had recommended to the Board that the Claimant tried to secure a deal with it. </p>

The Defendant pointed out that these pressures would have pertained in the counterfactual, which I accept. However, as I have already noted above, in the counterfactual the Claimant would have had greater sales from Tracktex with the result that these pressures would not have been as significant. This is consistent with the evidence of Mr Donald who accepted in cross-examination that the Claimant would have done anything to protect the sales of non-Tracktex product in the actual but rejected the suggestion that the position would be the same in the counterfactual. </p>

It was not put to Mr Donald in cross-examination that the Claimant would have agreed to an exclusive distribution agreement if Aqua had demanded one, and there was no other evidence to support this part of the Defendant’s case. Based on what I have held above, I do not have to decide this point. However, in case it matters, I would have held that it is more likely than not that the Claimant would have refused the demand if it had been made. This is essentially for the same reasons that I have given above in support of my view that the Claimant would not have been likely to offer an exclusive distribution agreement. The Claimant would not have needed to accede to such a demand, and it would not have been in its commercial interest to do so. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Firstly, the Defendant relied on the fact that Tracktex was the first-in-class geocomposite product, and that it needed to be accepted into a market that had been using sand for years. In his written evidence, Mr Hancock said that in 2012 the advantages of geocomposite products over sand were not as widely known as they are now, and that there was a reluctance by some contractors to use them. He explained that one of the reasons for this reluctance was safety; anti-pumping geocomposites were still new technology and if they did not perform there could be serious consequences. Another reason was a general resistance to change. He also explained that it was often the contractors or sub-contractors who decided which anti-pumping solution to use. </p>

Those efforts comprised attendance at trade fairs, the company website, and an (unnamed) engineer working full time on promoting the Defendant’s products (with about half that time spent on anti-pumping geocomposites). He gave evidence that the Defendant was required to exert significant effort to secure sales, and he estimated that about 30% of the Defendant’s sales were attributable solely to this hard work. He said that he and his team only encountered competition from Aqua about 50% of the time, and on this basis, he thought that approximately 15% of the Defendant’s sales would never have been made by the Claimant. </p>

He said his evidence was based on his own experience from selling and promoting to Network Rail engineers prior to 2015 and from feedback from colleagues in the field. Unfortunately, he did not identify who these colleagues were, and I did not hear evidence from them.

As a result, he agreed that any such efforts only related to non-Network Rail sales.

Mr Donald gave evidence that in the actual, if a contractor decided to use Hydrotex, that was a clear indicator that they preferred a geocomposite over sand for that particular project or piece of work.  He went on to say that if Hydrotex had not been available (as in the counterfactual), there was no reason why the contractor would not have selected Tracktex instead. The only other option would be to use sand, but that was the more costly choice and there would be no logical reason to make it when a geocomposite had been determined as a technically satisfactory option. (In this context, it will be recalled that antipumping geocomposites are not suitable for all tracks.)  </p>

I think that there is force in this submission, particularly bearing in mind the significant savings of cost and installation time over sand. It is also consistent with the contemporaneous evidence to the effect that Aqua were good at converting contractors, for example as noted by Mr Donald in his MD Report of the Board Meeting of 21<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> February 2011 (see paragraph 91 above), and as confirmed by him in cross-examination.</p>

It also claimed that Network Rail had predicted annual sales of 1300 for 2013-2014, which amounts to approximately 109 rolls per month.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Mr Donald gave evidence that Tracktex was manufactured through two discrete lines: needle punching (called the BF1 line) and laminating (called the L1 line). The BF1 line is also used to make two other geofabric products: Terratex and TED 10.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">I think that this argument is flawed for a number of reasons. Firstly, Mr MacGregor’s graph relates to invoices and hence reflects monthly variability in sales, not production. Secondly, the proportion of line usage for other products is the wrong comparator. What matters is the total remaining capacity in the actual, and whether that was sufficient to accommodate the additional manufacturing requirements in the counterfactual. Thirdly, whilst Mr Donald did accept that there was a potential to run out of capacity, he made clear that was only in theory. His evidence was that it was unlikely to happen in practice. He pointed to the fact that in the last 10-12 years, the factory had not even had to work at the weekend to meet production demands. He also explained that there were levels of protection (he called them “safety valves”) to ensure consistent supply: (i) Aqua retained their own stock of Tracktex which they used to meet their customer demand. They replenished their stock via stock orders every few months; (ii) Aqua’s stock orders usually had a lead time of 6-8 weeks and were not for immediate supply; (iii) the Claimant also kept stock of Tracktex (typically 100 rolls) in case of last-minute orders.</p>

The annual figures demonstrated that there was ample head room to manufacture the total quantity of Tracktex in the counterfactual. Moreover, the concerns about monthly variations seemed more theoretical than real, particularly bearing in mind the normal lead time on orders which would enable production to be spread over a period of weeks (if so required) and the stock of Tracktex that the Claimant held to meet any urgent demands. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">However, there was a small point of detail here which remained in dispute. Based on the matrix, the Claimant submitted that the Network Rail starting price for Tracktex in the counterfactual should be £10.90/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> whereas the Defendant said it should be £11/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span>. The discrepancy arises because Mr MacGregor calculated the average sales price for 2011/2012 over a 13-month period to reflect the fact that the Claimant had extended the 2011/2012 contractual period by one month in the actual. This had been done at the time to allow Network Rail to achieve total sales of over 1000 rolls and take advantage of the lowest price band of the matrix. Network Rail had received a rebate of £54,705 as a result. Mr MacGregor took this rebate into account in his calculation of the average sales price. Mr Chapman’s calculation was based on sales over the 12-month period of 1 April 2011 to 31 March 2012, although it did take the rebate into account. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">I prefer Mr MacGregor’s approach on this issue, for no other reason than it is anchored in the actual. I think it is likely that the Claimant would have approached the first year of pricing with Network Rail in the counterfactual in the same way that it did in the actual. The task of estimating what would have happened in the counterfactual is uncertain enough as it is, and it would be foolish to exacerbate that by ignoring what happened in the real world.</p>

In this context it is perhaps worth emphasising that it was common ground that non-Network Rail sales of Tracktex in the counterfactual would have been made through Aqua, as they were in the actual. This means that even though I have held that there would not have been an exclusive distribution arrangement between the Claimant and Aqua in the counterfactual, with the result that the Claimant would have made direct sales to Network Rail, it is still necessary to determine the price of sales to Aqua for the purposes of calculating the damages in respect of non-Network Rail sales. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Defendant argued that in the counterfactual, the Claimant would have used the 2011/2012 Network Rail pricing matrix, but with a 23% discount. This was because Mr MacGregor assumed that Aqua would have to purchase Tracktex from the Claimant at a price that was lower than the price agreed with Network Rail in order to remain competitive when selling to contractors. He arrived at the figure of 23% by calculating the average mark-up that Aqua had applied to sales of Tracktex in the actual, which he assessed at about 30% (a mark-up of 30% is mathematically equivalent to a discount of 23%). The 30% figure itself was based on a range of sources, as follows:</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">I have a number of difficulties with the Defendant’s suggested approach. First, in the actual the Claimant did not use the Network Rail pricing matrix to determine the prices that it charged to Aqua. Instead, it used a different pricing matrix specific to Aqua. Secondly, there was no evidence to support the view that the Claimant would have changed its approach in the counterfactual. Thirdly, there was no evidence of the prices that Aqua in fact charged in the actual. As noted above, Mr Donald did not know, because the relationship between the Claimant and Aqua was arm’s length. This means that the 30% figure is based on supposition. Fourthly, during the period between about April 2011 and December 2013 when the Claimant was supplying to Aqua and Network Rail in parallel, the average Tracktex prices to Aqua were higher than the average prices to Network Rail (presumably reflecting the different volumes that they bought). The Defendant’s sales prices of Hydrotex 2 to Keyline were also higher on average than its prices to Network Rail. This evidence undermines the assumption that prices to Aqua in the counterfactual should necessarily be lower than prices to Network Rail. Mr Hicks also explained that contractors are prepared to pay higher prices from distributors because of the additional services they offer (such as distribution, additional products, ready stocks, etc). </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">I should note that my reason for reaching this view is not the same as the main reason that Mr Chapman gave in his report for determining the price increase for the Network Rail and non-Network Rail sales separately. His justification for splitting the sales was that the Hydrotex sales to Network Rail were more reflective of the monopoly situation that would pertain in the counterfactual. However, the Defendant was critical of this view. Dr Pritchard pointed out that the sales of Hydrotex to Network Rail took place in two distinct periods. The first period was pursuant to the tender framework when prices were fixed and there was effectively no price growth. The second period was once the Second Tender had come to an end, after which there was an immediate price spike (presumably representing market freedom outside the tender framework), followed eventually by more stable price growth akin to that of the non-Network Rail sales.  During this second period, Hydrotex was also being sold to Network Rail in competition with Tracktex. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Firstly, the Defendant submitted that the best estimate of the annual price increase in the counterfactual was the evidence from Mr Donald rather than the models proposed by the experts. In his Third Witness Statement, Mr Donald had said that based on his experience of sales of products in the sector, an average annual rise in price of 2% p.a. seemed a reasonable assumption. He calculated that this would have meant an average price of £12/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> in 2013, increasing to £13.79/m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> in 2020. Whilst he did not say so expressly, the inference is that he considered those prices to be reasonable. He also sense-checked the 2% figure against the CPI, CPIH and RPI values for the years 2013-2020, and considered it to be comparable on average to those values. By his Sixth Witness Statement, Mr Donald’s evidence was that his aim would have been to secure a price increase of 2-5% each year to match the yearly increase in the cost of a sand blanket. However, he accepted in cross-examination that 2% was a “safer” figure, and he said it was the best figure to take based on his own commercial experience. </p>

Within a couple of months, the Hydrotex price had risen to £9.50 and whilst there was some fluctuation thereafter, it never went as low as £7.95 again. As a result, Mr MacGregor considered that these initial prices were given at a discounted rate so that the Defendant could enter the market. In his view, there would not have been an equivalent dip in the Tracktex price in the counterfactual, since by then it would have already been on the market for some time and would have an established price in accordance with the Network Rail price matrix. </p>

Finally, he said it would be inconsistent for the court to disregard the May-June sales of Hydrotex on the basis that they were the Defendant’s starting prices in circumstances where the Network Rail pricing matrix comprised the Claimant’s first prices to Network Rail. </p>

So far as I understand it from Mr MacGregor’s evidence, he excluded the July 2021 sales figures because they comprised sales at £nil value and this would have distorted the average.

The experts agreed that the period should be based on the longest possible period of reliable data. If the May-June 2013 prices are included in the SP calculation and the July 2021 prices are excluded from the FP calculation, which is my preferred approach, then the period of sales price growth is 7.16 years.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Defendant also argued that the annual average price increase would not be much more than around 1.7% - 2% because of price pressures from Network Rail. It relied on the fact that in the actual, the Claimant had succumbed to significant pressure from Network Rail to reduce the Tracktex price in 2011. It also relied on the evidence from Mr MacGregor where he said that in a one seller one buyer market, he would expect the larger entity (in this case Network Rail) to have significantly more bargaining power. Mr MacGregor did not support this opinion with any further reasoning or evidence, and so it is difficult to place much weight on it. Whilst there is no doubt that Network Rail was by far the larger commercial entity, and it would have been the Claimant’s primary customer for Tracktex, there is no objective evidence to suggest that these factors would have given it the upper hand in its negotiations with the Claimant in the counterfactual. In this context, I bear in mind that the Claimant would have been the only supplier of an anti-pumping geocomposite in the counterfactual and that the product offered several advantages over the only alternative of a sand blanket, including significant cost savings. Network Rail was behind the product and would have wanted to buy it. I also bear in mind that the Defendant was able to resist pressure from Network Rail to reduce its prices as between the First and Second Tenders and won the Second Tender even though its prices for Hydrotex 2 were the same as the First Tender. As a result, I consider that the Claimant and Network Rail would have had equal bargaining positions in the counterfactual. </p>

Firstly, the growth rate formula is simply an accounting tool that can be used to estimate annual percentage price growth. It does not provide <span style="font-style:italic">the</span> answer; it is no more than an aid to the court in reaching a view as to what the annual average price increase in the counterfactual would likely have been. Secondly, I was concerned not to add any further cost and delay to what I think has already been a complicated and time-consuming exercise in assessing damages. Thirdly, both parties impressed upon me that the task of assessing the likely annual price increase is not one that can be done with any precision (see above).</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">In his first report, Mr MacGregor had referred to and relied upon a document from the Claimant’s disclosure dated 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2011 entitled “Distribution Agreement” which suggested that the Claimant had agreed a rebate scheme with Network Rail. However, Mr Donald explained that this document was an unfinished draft which got superseded by the 15<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2011 price matrix I set out at paragraph 23 above and that the Claimant never agreed a rebate scheme with Network Rail.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">However, the Defendant maintained that sales of Tracktex to Aqua would have been subject to a rebate scheme. This argument was based on a disclosure document in which the Claimant confirmed to Aqua the details of the 2014 Annual Rebate Scheme. This was a scheme that gave Aqua a % rebate depending on the value of Tracktex sales that the Claimant made to it. Mr Donald explained in cross-examination that this scheme was in place after the pricing matrix had been dropped and the Claimant was simply selling to Aqua on a price per square metre.  The idea behind the rebate scheme was to incentivise Aqua to buy more. </p>

Accordingly, I reject the Defendant’s argument on this issue. The Aqua sales should not be subject to a rebate as part of the damages calculation. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">There was a small point of difference between the experts in the way that they proposed to calculate the pricing matrices in the counterfactual, based on the various issues that I have now determined (starting point, growth rate, etc). Mr MacGregor’s loss model approached the calculation on the basis of the number of rolls sold each year in the counterfactual, whereas Mr Chapman’s model approached the calculation on the basis of the total quantity in metres squared. Mr Chapman explained that his approach was adopted to simplify the calculation. However, he assumed that all rolls are 97.5m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span>, whereas this is only correct for the 3.9m width roll.  The 3.7m roll is 92.5m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span> and the 3.5m roll is 87.5m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">2</span>. As a result, his approach included unnecessary inaccuracy. In addition, Mr MacGregor pointed out that in the actual, price matrices were done based on the numbers of rolls sold, which is why he thought that was the better way to approach the calculation for the counterfactual. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Finally, there was a debate about whether the experts should calculate the damages figure based on a consistent annual growth rate after March 2019. Assuming that the Network Rail price matrix was reviewed biennially, this date would have been the first “new” pricing matrix in the counterfactual after the Second Tender had come to an end in July 2017 in the actual. When that happened, there was a price spike which Mr MacGregor considered was likely to have been caused by the Defendant’s freedom to charge higher prices once it was no longer subject to the tender framework. Since that would not have occurred in the counterfactual, he thought it was more appropriate to assume that the last two years of sales (2019-2021) were based on the maximum sales price the Claimant could have charged rather than by reference to annual growth. </p>

Moreover, I am not convinced that the point requires determination in light of the other findings I have already made. In the circumstances, I prefer not to express a view but will wait to hear further from the parties in the context of providing directions for the damages determination as needs be. </p>

These individuals concerned were not involved in the Tracktex side of the business and the redundancies had nothing to do with the infringement. As a result, despite the painful nature of the redundancy process, I consider that it is more likely than not that these redundancies would have happened regardless. It follows that I reject the Defendant’s primary case and decline to make any reduction in the overall damages figure based on the £120,000 annual savings the Claimant made from these three redundancies. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">However, it is more difficult to assess whether any of the production staff would also have been made redundant in the counterfactual, and if so, how many. The Claimant’s justification for the argument that one third of the production staff would not have been made redundant is that the presence of Hydrotex 2 on the market was one of three reasons recorded in the Board Minutes that had prompted the redundancies.  Mr Hicks submitted that this figure was generous to the Defendant bearing in mind that only 4% of the Claimant’s production was attributable to Tracktex. </p>

However, doing the best I can on the materials before me, I think it is more likely than not that the Claimant would still have made some production staff redundant in the counterfactual. In this context I bear in mind that there were other reasons beyond the impact of Hydrotex 2 that were contributing to the financial pressures of the Claimant which would still have occurred in any event. I also bear in mind that only 4% of the Claimant’s production was attributable to Tracktex, which means that it is unlikely that the Claimant would have needed to retain all five of the production staff, even allowing for the additional Tracktex production that would have been required in the counterfactual.  As noted above, Mr Donald also explained that there was extra production capacity through overtime as required. </p>

This was in marked contrast to what happened when Hydrotex 4 was launched in the actual. When Hydrotex 4 was actually launched in May 2021, that was off the back of established trading of Hydrotex 2, and the Defendant was able to exploit the sales and distribution channels and trading reputation it had already acquired with respect to that product. Mr Donald referred to the fact that the Defendant’s website makes little differentiation between Hydrotex 2 and Hydrotex 4, treating the new product simply as a replacement of the original.

I do not accept, however, that this would have achieved an immediate price reduction. In my view, this suggestion (which comes from Mr MacGregor’s report) is unreal. It ignores the fact that in the counterfactual, Tracktex would have had an established track record of over 10 years whereas Hydrotex 4 was a complete unknown. Mr Hancock accepted in cross-examination that people are creatures of habit and are unlikely to change from Tracktex without being persuaded that Hydrotex 4 was a suitable alternative (in terms of product efficiency, ease of installation, supply, etc). It also ignores the lead time on projects and orders. Even with price pressure from Network Rail, I think that it is much more likely that the Claimant would have reduced the Tracktex price on a gradual basis, and only then once Hydrotex 4 had started to gain some traction in the market. </p>

This may shed some light on how long it would have taken for the Tracktex price to go from the future counterfactual price (i.e. the price at May 2021, before Hydrotex 4 was on the market) to the future actual world price (i.e. the estimated price that Tracktex will be sold in the actual when prices have stabilised) once the price started to go down. If it took approximately five months before the Tracktex price was reduced at all (as Mr Chapman suggested) and then about a further 12-18 months before the reductions came to an end and the price stabilised, the time over which depression had occurred would be approximately two years.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">I found this issue difficult to decide, not least because it was not properly explained by either of the experts in their reports. Counsel for both parties agreed that the evidence was far from clear. It also seems to me that the approach of both experts is equally problematic. In particular, even if the Tracktex sales are a poor proxy for the reasons Mr MacGregor gives, I do not understand why the Hydrotex 2 sales are any better. They are subject to their own vagaries, such as the price spike after the end of the Second Tender, which mean that they are also a poor proxy. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">In the circumstances and doing the best I can on the paucity of helpful material on this issue, I have formed the view that Mr Chapman’s approach to calculating the ASP is the better one. The primary reason for this view is that he has approached the assessment separately for Network Rail and Aqua, which is consistent with my findings above. As a result, I think it is more convenient to use his calculations (subject to the necessary amendments in light of my other decisions) thereby making the process of calculating the overall damages figure more efficient and proportionate. I think that it is legitimate to take these considerations into account when there is so little else to go on. </p>

As Mr Hicks pointed out, his written evidence had not given this impression; to the contrary, it had even referred to one order that the Defendant had received for Crossrail. However, I understand that there is a difference between bidding for the Crossrail supply contract as a whole and meeting a one-off order, and his evidence was not addressing the former. When questioned, Mr Hancock said that he had checked his files and had no record of Hydrotex being put forward for Crossrail. He also said that he would have known if Dave Dutton had made a bid, since he was Mr Dutton’s manager at the time. </p>

What matters is the reason why the Claimant agreed the price it did with Aqua in order to secure the Crossrail contract. The Claimant submitted that it was because of general price competition which had been caused by Hydrotex 2. Mr Hicks argued that such price competition was foreseeable, including in the form of a contractor seeking to use the presence of competition on the market as a negotiating tactic to achieve lower prices. </p>

The MD Report makes that clear. That information came from Aqua, who no doubt had its own commercial motivations for providing it and obtaining the lowest possible price it could. In this context, it is to be remembered that the Claimant’s relationship with Aqua was arm’s length, and the Claimant did not know what price Aqua supplied Tracktex to Balfour Beatty. </p>

Nor was it foreseeable that the Claimant would offer such a significant price reduction (nearly 30%) on the basis of such information without checking its accuracy first.

This has been done so that the Crossrail price anomaly does not skew the average value. Based on this approach, when the loss on the Crossrail sales is calculated, the Defendant will only pay for any price depression caused by the infringement. This approach was not challenged by the Claimant, and so I take it that it is not in dispute. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Mr Donald gave evidence that the Claimant generally had cash reserves in the actual in the region of £0.5million to £1.5million. In the counterfactual, since it would have made larger profits, these reserves are likely to have been higher. He said that he would have looked for better opportunities to earn interest or dividends from cash reserves than was available from a deposit rate of interest, and that at the very least he would have looked at ways of investing the money to make sure it kept pace with inflation. I accept that evidence.</p>

              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.11in">The price of Network Rail sales should be based on the 2011-2012 Network Rail price matrix, with an annual price increase of 3.25% applied every two years. The price of non-Network Rail sales should be based on the 2011-2012 Aqua price matrix, with an annual price increase of 2% applied every year. The pricing matrices should be calculated on the basis of number of rolls. There should not be an additional rebate in respect of the non-Network Rail sales beyond that included with the pricing matrix. </p>
