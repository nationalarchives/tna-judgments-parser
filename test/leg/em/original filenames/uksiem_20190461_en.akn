            <p>These Regulations are intended to ensure that the UK can operate an effective sanctions regime in relation to Iran after the UK leaves the EU.  When these Regulations come into force they will replace, with substantially the same effect, the EU sanctions regime relating to Iran’s nuclear weapons programmes that is currently in force under EU legislation and related UK regulations.  This sanctions regime also gives effect to the UK’s obligations under United Nations Security Council resolution 2231. </p>

            <p>The UK’s implementation of UN and other multilateral sanctions currently relies largely on the European Communities Act 1972. Each sanctions regime generally consists of an EU Council Decision, a corresponding directly-applicable EU Council Regulation, and related UK regulations made under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 and other domestic legislation.  There are currently around 35 sanctions regimes that take effect in the UK under EU law and associated UK secondary legislation.  These include country-specific sanctions regimes, including in relation to Russia and the DPRK, as well as regimes targeting Da’esh, Al Qaida and other terrorist groups. </p>

            <p>The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 will repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and provides for some EU sanctions law to form part of domestic law after the UK has left the EU.  However, that Act does not provide powers to substantially amend that retained EU law and it does not provide powers to lift sanctions or impose new sanctions. In addition, that Act does not retain the effect of certain sanctions (travel bans) which are in force by virtue of EU Council Decisions (rather than under EU Regulations).  The Sanctions Act was introduced to address these issues by providing the UK with the legal framework necessary to allow the UK to implement sanctions autonomously.</p>

Using the power contained in section 54(2)(a) of the Sanctions Act, the following will be revoked and replaced by these Regulations: Council Regulation (EU) No 267/2012 of 23 March 2012 (a directly applicable regulation that would otherwise form part of domestic law on exit day under the EU (Withdrawal) Act 2018); the Iran (European Union Financial Sanctions) Regulations 2016 (made under section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972); the Export Control (Iran Sanctions) Order 2016 (made under both the European Communities Act 1972 and the Export Control Act 2002); and the Iran (Financial Sanctions) Order 2007 (made under the United Nations Act 1946).</p>

            <p>Her Majesty’s Government’s (HMG’s) policy on Iran includes the use of sanctions to encourage Iran’s compliance with the relevant UN obligations, promote the abandonment by Iran of nuclear weapons programmes, and to restrict the ability of Iran to develop nuclear weapons and nuclear weapons delivery systems. There is an existing EU sanctions regime in relation to nuclear activities in Iran.  It was established in 2007 to meet EU Members States’ obligation under international law to implement UN sanctions imposed under United National Security Council resolution 1737 (2006), which introduced sanctions against Iran for its proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities.  The EU complemented UN sanctions with additional autonomous sanctions for the same purpose of constraining Iran’s proliferation-sensitive nuclear activities.  In January 2016, the EU began implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA).  The JCPOA was agreed by the E3 (UK, France and Germany), the US, Russia, China and Iran – with the EU as coordinator.  The US withdrew from the agreement in 2018.  The JCPOA was designed to ensure the exclusively peaceful nature of Iran’s nuclear programme and includes eventual lifting of all UN, multilateral and national sanctions related to Iran's nuclear programme in return for monitored, verified implementation of nuclear-related measures by Iran.</p>

        <paragraph>
          <num>7.2</num>
          <content>
            <p>The JCPOA employs a phased approach and includes reciprocal commitments as laid down in the agreement and endorsed by the UN Security Council.  As a result of the JCPOA, the EU suspended a number of sanctions in connection with the Iranian nuclear programme in January 2016.   Sanctions that are suspended include financial, banking and insurance measures on non-designated individuals and entities; restrictive measures on Iran’s oil, gas and petrochemical sectors; and prohibitions on sale, supply, purchase, export, transfer or transport of gold and precious metals.  Sanctions that remain in place include the arms embargo, restrictive measures related to missile technology, restrictions on certain nuclear-related transfers and activities, and provisions concerning graphite and other semi-finished metals and software, which are subject to an authorisation regime.  If Iran continues to meet its commitments under the JCPOA, the EU will suspend its proliferation-related sanctions, including arms and missile technology sanctions, in October 2023 and terminate all of sanctions suspended in January 2016.  In October 2025, the EU will terminate all its remaining nuclear-related provisions and all UN provisions still in place will also be terminated. </p>

            <p>Bringing this sanctions regime into UK law using the powers in the Sanctions Act will enable all the sanctions measures to continue to operate effectively after the UK leaves the EU, as well as enabling HMG to amend and lift the sanctions, or impose further sanctions, autonomously. </p>

            <p>Part 2 of this instrument deals with the designation of persons (including individuals, entities and organisations) under the sanctions regime.  It provides that any person for the time being named by the Security Council for the purposes of United National Security Council resolution 2231 (2015) is a designated person for the purposes of the asset-freezing and other financial measures.  It also lists the criteria against which a Minister may make a decision to designate a person as being subject to a travel ban or asset freeze. </p>

The names of those designated by the Secretary of State will be held on a separate administrative list on gov.uk to enable immediate publication following a decision to make or amend a designation. This limits the opportunity for designated persons to remove assets from the UK.  Persons designated by the UN are listed on the United Nations Security Council Consolidated List and designations will also be publicised on gov.uk.    </p>

            <p>Part 3 of the instrument sets out financial sanctions measures that can be imposed on designated persons. Financial sanctions include freezing a designated person’s funds and economic resources (non-monetary assets, such as property or vehicles) and ensuring that funds and economic resources are not made available to or for the benefit of a designated person or entity, either directly or indirectly. The instrument sets out exceptions and licensing derogations from these sanctions that will be applicable or available, as the case may be, under certain prescribed circumstances, such as to enable those listed to have access to funds to satisfy their basic needs.</p>

            <p>Part 4 of the instrument sets out the effect of immigration measures made under this instrument.  Designation under regulation 5 of the instrument means that section 8B of the Immigration Act 1971 then applies to the designated person: a designated person is banned from travelling to or via the UK and any permission to stay in the UK that they may have is cancelled. The Secretary of State may direct, on an individual basis, that the travel ban does not apply The travel ban in respect of persons named on the UN’s Consolidated List is implemented through section 8B of the Immigration Act 1971, and not these Regulations.</p>

These sanctions include restrictions on the trade of certain goods and technology including military goods and technology, missile-related goods and technology, nuclear-related goods and technology, graphite and relevant metals, and enterprise resource planning software. There are further prohibitions on arrangements relating to uranium mining or certain restricted goods and technology, for example the acceptance of a loan from a person connected with Iran where the object of the loan is to enable that person to participate in a commercial activity involving uranium mining or certain goods and technology such as missile-related goods. There are also prohibitions on services related to certain ships and aircraft. </p>

            <p>Part 6 of the instrument makes provision in respect of exceptions and licences that may apply or be available, as the case may be, in respect of prohibitions and requirements under this regime.  For example, and in relation to Treasury licences, a designated person can apply for a licence allowing funds to be released in order to pay for essential goods or services such as food. It states that the Treasury may issue licences to permit activity prohibited by Part 3 (Finance) where it is appropriate for a purpose set out in Schedule 2 of the instrument. Part 6 also details exceptions to trade prohibitions.  It states that licences provided by the Secretary of State may permit activity prohibited by Part 5 (Trade).  Guidance will provide further detail about licensing.</p>

The key distinction is that those powers are contingent on there being reasonable grounds to suspect that a criminal offence has been committed, whereas the purpose of these powers is to identify, seize and dispose of goods which are being dealt with in contravention, or deemed contravention, of certain trade sanctions. </p>

This is because this instrument replaces, with substantially the same effect, the existing EU sanctions regime relating to Iran’s nuclear activities. </p>

            <p>HMG ran a public consultation on the Sanctions Act which was open for nine weeks.  Over 30,000 individuals and companies received a copy of the White Paper, and 34 individuals provided written responses.  Government officials held a number of roundtables with key sectors, including financial services, trade bodies, the legal profession, NGOs and industry professionals and regulators.  The main areas of concern raised in consultation responses were around the legal threshold for sanctions designations, the rights of designated persons to challenge their designations, and licensing procedures.  All of these concerns were taken into account in the drafting of the Sanctions Act.  </p>

            <p>An Impact Assessment has not been produced for these Regulations, as the instrument is intended to ensure existing sanctions remain in place following EU exit. This instrument is intended to substantially deliver the same policy effects as the existing EU sanctions. An impact assessment was, however, produced for the primary legislation and can be found at <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2017-2019/0069/sanctions-and-anti-money-laundering-IA.pdf%20"><u>https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/2017-2019/0069/sanctions-and-anti-money-laundering-IA.pdf</u></a><u>.</u> That assessment concluded that the introduction of the Act, and statutory instruments under it to transfer existing regimes into UK law, would overall reduce uncertainty for business and would not result in significant costs or impact, apart from some familiarisation costs for businesses associated with adapting to the new legislative framework.</p>

            <p>The Sanctions Act requires regular reviews of these Regulations.  Under section 30 of the Act, the Secretary of State must consider whether or not these Regulations are still appropriate for their stated purpose and lay an annual report before Parliament, confirming either that is the case or explaining what action has or will be taken in consequence of that review.  As such, the Minister does not consider that a review clause in these Regulations is appropriate.  </p>
