            <p>Regulation (EU) No 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (“the Basic Regulation”) as amended by S.I. 2019/645 establishes a framework and essential requirements in respect of aviation safety regulation.  In particular, it provides for the implementation of the SARPs contained in the Annexes (as amended from time to time) to the Chicago Convention. </p>

            <p>The Basic Regulation, as retained in UK law, contains regulation making powers for the Secretary of State to make and amend detailed regulations in respect of aviation safety to ensure compliance with the essential requirements set out in the Annexes to the Regulation and to meet the general objectives of the Regulation. This instrument is made in exercise of the regulation making powers set out in Articles 17 and 19 (airworthiness), 23 (pilots), 62 (certification, oversight and enforcement) and 127(3) (regulations) of the Basic Regulation.</p>

              <p>This Regulation establishes the requirements for the approval of organisations responsible for the design or production of aeronautical products (aircraft, engines or propellors) and parts. It also establishes the type certification (design approval) requirements for products and parts and the release to service of individual products and parts that are newly produced. </p>

            <content>
              <p>The Aviation Safety (Amendment) regulation does not set new aviation safety standards, it amends Regulation (EU) 748/2012 to place a requirement upon organisations involved in the design or production of aeronautical products or parts to implement a Safety Management System (SMS). This requirement is needed to bring the retained regulation up to date and in line with international standards established in Annex 19 to the Chicago Convention and will ensure that the UK is compliant with those standards. As discussed in paragraph 7.4 below, this requirement came into force in 2013, at which point the requirement was on the EU, though there has been incremental progress towards meeting the requirement prior to EU exit. This final stage in the process will ensure better oversight and continuous improvement of aviation safety by bringing organisations in line with other parts of the aviation sector. An SMS requires a systematic approach to managing safety, including the necessary organisational structures, accountability, responsibilities, policies and procedures. The principles are set out in ICAO Document 9859 (<a href="https://www.icao.int/safety/safetymanagement/pages/guidancematerial.aspx"><u>https://www.icao.int/safety/safetymanagement/pages/guidancematerial.aspx</u></a>) and organised into four components:</p>

            <content>
              <p>While the retained EU legislation already sets out requirements for the management systems of these organisations, which ensure a suitable level of safety is in place, these do not fully meet the Annex 19 requirements for SMS, implementation of which could enhance safety oversight and assurance. Organisations in most other areas of aviation are already required to have SMS, but the Annex 19 deadline, of November 2013, has been missed in respect of design and production organisations and aircraft maintenance organisations. Prior to EU exit, it was the responsibility of the EU commission to introduce legislation meeting this requirement. The development of amendments to EU requirements to address the deficiencies was largely complete at the time of EU Exit, but the legislation was not adopted at EU level until late in 2021, and so was not retained in UK law. Since we left the EU, we want to ensure we comply with ICAO standards, so have been working to move to compliance on this, and due to the need for detailed policy development on this, and given prioritisation of regulatory changes, are bringing this forward now. </p>

            <content>
              <p>Some elements of this amendment will come into force on 1 July 2024 (see table 7.22). This later timeline reflects the fact that the full effective implementation of an SMS takes time and we want the organisations impacted to have enough time to implement the new requirements safely and in a considered manner that meets the organisation’s requirements, and allow time for Civil Aviation Authority (“CAA”) review and approval. Some organisations are already implementing the required standards but will still need to go through the CAA approval process; others who need to implement from scratch will need additional time as it is a significant undertaking. </p>

              <p>ICAO recognises that full implementation of all components and elements of the SMS framework may take up to 5 years depending on the organisation’s maturity and complexity. In the first year, the SMS system is only expected to be Present and Suitable. As the system evolves through practice towards excellence, it becomes Operating and Effective. Given this, organisations will be required to be fully compliant with the legislation and the CAA will commence its oversight process from July 2026.</p>

              <p>The instrument also introduces a definition of maintenance data to ensure consistency with retained Regulation (EU) No 748/2012. Some elements of this amendment will come into force on 21 June 2023 and others on 1 July 2024, see table at 7.22 for details. Where additional time is needed prior to the coming into force date, this is to allow industry time to prepare and implement changes in advance of new regulations being in force.</p>

              <p>The Table of Proposed Amendments, published by the CAA alongside the Opinion and Instruction Document relating to this amendment at <a href="http://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAAOID0022withTables.pdf"><u>http://publicapps.caa.co.uk/docs/33/CAAOID0022withTables.pdf</u></a> provides full detail of where later coming into force dates are needed, beyond the level provided in the table in 7.22. To give a high level summary, referring to the ‘Purpose of the Amendment’ section of page 1 of the Table of Proposed Amendments, changes relating to Safety Management Systems, Ageing Aircraft Structures and Eligibility of parts and appliances for installation without a Form 1 (EOPF1) require a later (2024) coming into force date. Conversely, changes relating to Ageing Aircraft Structures, Rationalisation (except where linked to SMS amendments) and Correction do not place new requirements on industry in terms of preparation, so can come into force immediately.</p>

              <p>The above-mentioned table gives an expected coming into force date of 1 January 2024, rather than 1 July 2024 as mentioned in the instrument; this was the original date by which the provisions were expected to come into force, based on an SI laying date in 2022. As these changes took longer to finalise than expected, they are now being made in 2023, and the coming into force date was correspondingly changed to 1 July 2024. This is to ensure industry has sufficient time to prepare for the effect of these changes, and is not expected to have a significant impact on safety.</p>

            <p>The changes made by this instrument, other than the minor changes set out in paragraphs 7.14 to 7.20, arise from work on the implementation of ICAO SARPs and general safety enhancements undertaken by EASA while the UK was a member of the EU. This involved two rounds of consultation. The UK fully participated in the development of the requirements and supported the position reached after the consultation had taken place. A consultation on the changes to the retained legislation has not taken place as the views of the aviation industry, which are generally supportive, were already known through the EASA consultation. </p>

This is because the direct impacts on business have been assessed at under £5m per year and light-touch internal analysis has been conducted instead, the findings of which are presented below. </p>

            <p>It is estimated that the changes mentioned in the paragraph above have an Equivalent Annual Net Direct Cost to Businesses (EANDCB) of £0.04 million. It has been assessed that businesses will face transition costs as a result of the need to provide initial training to all employees, provide further training to nominated postholders, and undertake Exposition/Handbook updates. Ongoing costs for businesses will result from the additional work hours required to comply with SMS requirements. Government will face ongoing costs as a result of the requirement to fund the CAA’s oversight of SMS. Over a 10-year appraisal period, a total net present cost of £2.8 million is estimated.</p>

            <p>In relation to the other requirements introduced by the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 and to Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014, which set out the requirements for the continued airworthiness of aircraft and aeronautical products, DfT has not published an impact assessment, as the direct impacts on business have been assessed at under £5m per year. Many of the potentially affected organisations already satisfy the requirements of the policy, as they are required to satisfy these under the conditions of their third-party European approvals. For the remaining organisations, we estimate that the policy has an EANDCB of £0.21 million and therefore falls within the £5 million De Minimis Threshold. There is deemed to be no material risk of the realised cost exceeding the threshold, as the identified costs are substantially below this level, and there are no areas of uncertainty that could cause these costs to fluctuate by the orders of magnitude required.</p>
