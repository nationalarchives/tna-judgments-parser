              <content>
                <p>The United Kingdom’s position on the trade in cat and dog fur remains unchanged post the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union. That is why this EC Regulation, which imposes a ban on the import, export and placing on the market of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur, forms part of the retained domestic legislation of the United Kingdom. The placing on the market of such fur remains illegal across the whole of the United Kingdom through the combined effect of both the EC Regulation, as directly applicable in Northern Ireland, and the retained domestic version of the EC Regulation as amended by Part 2 of this instrument in relation to Great Britain.</p>

              <content>
                <p>The retained domestic version of the EC Regulation, as it applies in relation to Great Britain, contains a number of references to the European Union, the European Commission and EU laws that are no longer appropriate. Part 2 of these Regulations amends or removes these inappropriate references in the retained domestic version of the EC Regulation as it applies in Great Britain and replaces them with references to legislation governing Great Britain or the United Kingdom, as appropriate. </p>

              <content>
                <p>As the retained domestic version of the EC Regulation imposes a total ban on the import, export and placing on the market of cat and dog fur in Great Britain, this could arguably include the movement of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur from Great Britain to Northern Ireland and vice versa. Whilst the import, export and placing on the market of cat and dog fur remains illegal, given that the United Kingdom is one customs territory, Part 2 of these Regulations amends the retained domestic version of the EC Regulation so as to derogate from the general prohibition in Article 3 and enable, from a technical but not practical perspective, the movement of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur from Northern Ireland to Great Britain. This amendment upholds the principle of unfettered movement within the United Kingdom’s internal market, whilst retaining strict controls on these products.</p>

              <p>However, the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments made a report in respect of the Cat and Dog Fur (Control of Movement etc.) (EU Exit Regulations) 2021, suggesting improved drafting of the penalty provisions with respect to Scotland and Northern Ireland, as it did not include specific references to the statutory maximum for summary fines. </p>

              <p>The JCSI in its report stated that it considered that the penalty provisions in the statutory instrument did not provide correctly for the penalty provisions in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Sentencing provisions for each criminal jurisdiction within the United Kingdom are as a matter of legislative drafting outlined firstly with respect to that particular jurisdiction, and thereafter with respect to summary and indicatable offence penalties. At the time of the Cat and Dog Fur (Control of Import, Export and Placing on the Market) Regulations 2008 being made, summary fines in all criminal law jurisdictions in the United Kingdom had the same statutory maxima. This position was changed in 2012 with the Legal Aid Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, which removed the cap for England and Wales in statute, meaning that fines on a summary basis were now capped in reference only to an offender’s means to pay or judicial powers as a matter of discretion. This change only extended to England and Wales; Scotland and Northern Ireland retained their maxima caps for summary fines.</p>

            <p>The EC Regulation was published in the Official Journal on 11th December 2007 and the prohibition officially came into force 20 days thereafter. However, Member States were given until 31st December 2008 to provide an effective, persuasive and proportionate penalty for breach of this directly applicable prohibition. Existing United Kingdom legislation, the Customs &amp; Excise Management Act 1979 (CEMA), provides a penalty of 7 years’ imprisonment for deliberate breach of any enactment which has the effect of prohibiting imports into or exports from the United Kingdom, but this would not cover unintentional breaches of the customs prohibition or deliberate or unintentional breaches of the prohibition on sale.</p>

            <p>The EC Regulation was first proposed in response to pressure from non-government organisations across the European Union who suggested that the import, export and sale of cat and dog fur was widespread. Representatives in the fur trade argued that a ban was not required on the basis that they did not believe that the trade in this fur was common. The impact assessment prepared by the European Commission found very little evidence of a trade in cat and dog fur.</p>

              <p>This instrument is required to correct technical deficiencies in retained EU law and to implement the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland to the EU Withdrawal Agreement. The amendments made by Part 2 of this instrument, which apply in respect of Great Britain only, ensure that the existing prohibition under the EC Regulation on the import, export and placing on the market of cat and dog fur is directly applicable in Northern Ireland. The amendments made by Part 2 of these Regulations also derogate from the general prohibition in Article 3 of the retained domestic version of the EC Regulation to technically (but not practically) enable the movement of cat and dog fur and products containing such fur from Northern Ireland to Great Britain in accordance with the domestic policy of unfettered movement within the United Kingdom’s internal market. The amendments made by Part 2 of this instrument also include a regulation making power for the Secretary of State to further derogate from the general prohibition under Article 3 of the retained domestic version of the EC Regulation for educational or taxidermy purposes.  </p>
