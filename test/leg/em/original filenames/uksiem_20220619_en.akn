              <p>The Novel Foods (Authorisations) and Smoke Flavourings (Modification of Authorisations) (England) Regulations 2022 were laid on 20th May 2022.  Those Regulations added four novel foods and amended one novel food on the list of authorised novel foods in Retained Regulation (EU) 2017/2470.  These updates to the list come into force on 30th June 2022.</p>

              <p>Following the publication of the Novel Foods (Authorisations) and Smoke Flavourings (Modification of Authorisations) (England) Regulations 2022, an omission in the column headers of a table relating to 3’-Sialyllactose and 6’-Sialyllactose was identified.  This omission reduced the maximum levels of the novel foods that could be added to foods, effectively reducing the maximum levels of those novel foods that can be present in food products by approximately 3%.</p>
