          <p>The Medicines (Gonadotrophin-Releasing Hormone Analogues) (Emergency Prohibition) (England, Wales and Scotland) Order 2024 (“the Existing Order”) is due to expire at the end of 2nd September 2024. This Order is made to replace the Existing Order, so that there is no break in the legislative provision in Great Britian. It applies in Northern Ireland for the first time. In Northern Ireland, the Order will come into force on 27th August. In Great Britain, the provisions will commence on Tuesday 3rd September.</p>

          <p>The aim of this Order is to reduce and remove risks to patient safety through ensuring that a consistent approach to prescribing of gonadatrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) analogues is taken by all prescribers. These medicines are hormones that are licensed to treat conditions in children including precocious puberty or certain growth disorders, and in adults prostate and breast cancers as well as other disorders.  These medicines can also have the effect of suppressing puberty as a treatment for gender dysphoria or gender incongruence but are not licensed for this purpose.  The independent review of gender identity services for children and young people (“Cass Review<authorialNote marker="1"><p> <a href="https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/"><u>Final Report – Cass Review</u></a> https://cass.independent-review.uk/home/publications/final-report/</p></authorialNote>”), found that the use of these medicines in the context of gender dysphoria or gender incongruence was not evidence based and should change.  The desired approach was set out in the Cass Review, namely that prescribing of GnRH analogues for the treatment of gender dysphoria or gender incongruence in children and young people under the age of 18 should only be done with the agreement of the national multi-disciplinary team and/ or under a research protocol. In practice this will usually mean prescribing done in, or under the supervision of, NHS specialised services. NHS England<authorialNote marker="2"><p> <a href="https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/clinical-policy-puberty-suppressing-hormones/"><u>NHS England » Clinical polic y: puberty suppressing hormones</u></a> https://www.england.nhs.uk/publication/clinical-policy-puberty-suppressing-hormones/</p></authorialNote> and the NHS in Scotland have paused new prescribing of GnRH analogues for the treatment of gender dysphoria or gender incongruence in children and young people under the age of 18. </p>

          <p>The Order seeks to achieve this aim through (1) prohibiting the sale or supply of specified medicines against prescriptions from a UK private prescriber which would start a child or young person under the age of 18 on a medical pathway for gender incongruence/ dysphoria; (2) prohibiting sale or supply against prescriptions from a EEA or Switzerland-registered prescriber for specified medicines to a child or young person under the age of 18; (3) making exceptions for sale or supply against NHS prescriptions. The Order will expire at the end of 26th November.</p>

For patients aged 18 or over, a prescription from an EEA or Switzerland registered prescriber will be dispensed in the UK providing verification of age and identity can be shown to the dispensing pharmacist. </p>

          <p>The Cass Review found that there is not a reliable evidence base upon which to make clinical decisions about the use of GnRH analogues to treat gender dysphoria/incongruence, or for children and their families to make informed choices. The Cass Review concluded that because of the limited evidence, and potential risks to patient safety, these medicines should only be offered for this purpose under a research protocol, and/ or with the agreement of the national multi-disciplinary team. The NHS has implemented these recommendations. The Cass Review’s conclusions have been accepted and endorsed by governments, regulators and clinical leaders in the UK.</p>

(Amendment) Regulations 2024 (S.I. 2024/728) (“the Regulations”), which came into force on 26th June 2024 and do not have an expiry date.

          <p>It is the government’s view that the same principles to ensuring the safety of children and young people should be taken regardless of the clinician or setting responsible for their care. This government has committed to implementing the Cass Review and agrees with its conclusions that, for this group of children and young people, safety can be best assured under the supervision of a national multi-disciplinary team and with new initiations onto a medical pathway for gender dysphoria/incongruence done under the governance of a clinical trial. The government is aware that not all prescribing of these medicines is being done in accordance with this position and is of the view that this presents a risk to patient safety. </p>

          <p>The Order aligns with the NHS’s clinical policy, providing clarity and removing ambiguity for all parties – patients and their families, prescribers, employers/ commissioners and regulators.  Where a patient is under the care of a UK-regulated prescriber, to ensure patient safety use of these medicines should be consistent regardless of the setting in which the prescriber is operating. The only excepted prescribers from the Order (and the Regulations) are in NHS secondary or tertiary care, where the detailed approach to managing patients with gender dysphoria is set out in the interim service specification<authorialNote marker="3"><p> <a href="https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.england.nhs.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F04%2Finterim-service-spec-CYP-Gender-service-12-March-2024.docx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK"><u>interim-service-spec-CYP-Gender-service-12-March-2024.docx (live.com)</u></a> https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.england.nhs.uk%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2023%2F04%2Finterim-service-spec-CYP-Gender-service-12-March-2024.docx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK</p></authorialNote>. </p>

          <p>In the case of prescriptions issued in the EEA and Switzerland, dispensing pharmacists in the UK cannot easily verify the purpose for which a prescription has been written. For this reason, all prescriptions of GnRH analogues from an EEA or Switzerland registered prescriber for patients under the age of 18 dated on or after 3rd June 2024 in Great Britain and on or after the 27th August in Northern Ireland are no longer to be dispensed in the UK. Prescriptions of GnRH analogues from an EEA or Switzerland registered prescriber for patients over the age of 18 may be dispensed in the UK providing verification of age and identity can be shown to the dispensing pharmacist. This provision is included because it is not mandatory for prescriptions from EEA prescribers to include the age/date of birth of patients over the age of 12.  </p>

          <p>Only legislation can achieve consistent action to ensure patient safety across all sources of prescriptions.  The Order is being made on an emergency basis to respond to the serious safety risks for vulnerable children and young people. Before the Existing Order was introduced, providers registered outside of the UK beyond the jurisdiction of UK regulators, were able to offer services that are not evidence based and treatment options that are not available through UK registered providers for safety reasons.  The Existing Order closed these loopholes, and this Order provides continuity by renewing the actions taken to prevent harm in Great Britain and extends them to Northern Ireland for the first time, while a consultation takes place on whether the restrictions should be made permanent. In doing so, the Order prevents a scenario where these medicines are available for a short period of time, which could otherwise create the perverse incentive to begin taking them or ‘stockpiling’ the medication during the consultation period. </p>

These set out the new the new requirements to ensure all those affected have relevant information to ensure compliance. </p>

          <p>Further information will be published alongside this Order. NHS England will also write to all general practitioners in England, to provide guidance on how to support patients presenting to primary care across a range of scenarios. In the event a patient is under 18 years of age and is already being prescribed GnRH analogues from an EEA or Switzerland registered prescriber, the letter sets out that GPs can take continuation of the prescription of these medicines, if they consider that it is in the best interests of the patient, that relevant due diligence requirements have been met and that they feel competent to do so. In the event a prescription is discontinued, GPs should consider the individual’s need for further professional support, including through Children and Young People mental health services or through the specialist gender pathway.  </p>

        <content>
          <p>Prior to the introduction of the Existing Order (in Great Britain) and the Regulations (in England and the equivalent regulations in Wales), and this Order (in the United Kingdom), the previous policy was that there were no legal restrictions which solely related to prescribing of GnRH analogues. Prescribers were expected to prescribe these medicines in accordance with the medicine’s marketing authorisation and best available clinical evidence.  In the case of gender dysphoria/gender incongruence, these expectations were not met, leading to variation in practice, and risks to patients’ safety.  </p>

          <p>GnRH analogues are prescribed off-label (i.e. for purposes for which they are not licensed) to treat gender dysphoria and gender incongruence in children, and there is a lack of reliable evidence for prescribers to use, with variation in prescribing practice. The Order, in conjunction with the Regulations, therefore, takes necessary steps to ensure consistent access to and prescribing of GnRH analogues.</p>

          <p>There are consultation requirements applicable to the making of orders under section 62 of the Medicines Act 1968, but when making an emergency order under section 62(3) of the Medicines Act 1968, no prior consultation is required. A consultation in accordance with the relevant legal requirements will be undertaken for a permanent ban, to allow for different views to be considered on the issue and shape how the legislation will work in practice on a permanent basis.</p>

          <p>The Secretary of State also met with LGBT+ representative groups to hear directly about the health and care issues that are most important to them. The restrictions were discussed, amongst a range of topics. Concerns were raised regarding access to these medicines for patients who were already prescribed a course of treatment prescribed by an EEA or Switzerland registered prescriber (before 3rd June), the impact the restrictions may have on mental health and wellbeing of children and young people with gender incongruence, as well as prescribers’ understanding of the new rules. As set out above, further communications will be issued before the commencement of the Order. </p>

          <p>The Limited Impact Assessment presents a qualitative assessment of costs and benefits. The main benefit is an improvement in patient safety for under 18s starting a medical pathway for gender incongruence/dysphoria, as UK prescribing of puberty blockers for gender dysphoria, and all puberty blocker prescribing originating in the EEA, are reduced. The reform also delivers improved consistency of treatment for such patients.</p>

          <p>The Order maintains the status quo in Great Britain while introducing the restrictions for the first time in Northern Ireland.  The impact on business, charities or voluntary bodies is expected to be minimal, given the relatively low number of patients affected and on the assumption that the NHS or Health and Social Care Northern Ireland provides alternative treatment where appropriate. Prescribers and dispensers will need to be familiar with the new rules and provide appropriate advice to patients. </p>

          <p>The Order is made under section 62 of the Medicines Act 1968. Ministers are of the opinion that it is essential to make the Order, with effect from 3rd September in Great Britain, to maintain the existing restrictions. In Northern Ireland, where the restrictions will apply for the first time, the Order should come into force with immediate effect (5 days after laying in Parliament) to avoid serious danger to health. This is consistent with the rationale for the Existing Order, which introduced the restrictions for the first time in Great Britain.</p>

          <p>The Existing Order was subject to legal challenge, with the judgment handed down on 29 July 2024. A combination of the need to await the outcome of the judicial review before UK Ministers could make a final decision, to allow Ministers in the Northern Ireland Executive to determine and agree the territorial scope of the Order and the need for the Northern Ireland provisions to come into force with immediate effect means it has not been possible to adhere to the 21-day rule. </p>

          <p>Section 62(1) permits Ministers to prohibit the sale or supply of medicinal products of any description. That prohibition may be total, or subject to specified exceptions.

Instead, it creates exceptions in relation to specified categories of patients, and in relation to specified purposes, and makes sale or supply subject to conditions.</p>
