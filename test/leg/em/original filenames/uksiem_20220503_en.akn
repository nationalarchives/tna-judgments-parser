            <p>However, the powers under the Child Support Act 1991 are not specifically targeted to enabling electronic communications.  Therefore, we have elected to use the more specific power in section 8 of the Electronic Communications Act 2000 (ECA 2000)<authorialNote marker="9"><p> https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2000/7/contents</p></authorialNote> to make these amendments.

            <p>There are safeguards to the proposed use of electronic communications, including that the instrument requires any electronic communication as well as its form and the address to be agreed with the recipient. Customers will be able to challenge decisions sent by electronic means in accordance with the statutory system of revisions, supersessions and appeals, and these appeal rights are not affected by the amendments. For example, there are appeal rights to the First Tier Tribunal against decisions concerning maintenance calculations, and to the Magistrates Court against Deduction from Earnings Orders and Deduction Orders.  </p>

            <p>Child maintenance legislation is based on the general principle that all parents take financial responsibility for all of their children. The main objective of child maintenance legislation is to maximise the number of effective maintenance arrangements for children who live apart from one or both of their parents. The Child Maintenance Service (CMS) continuously strives to modernise and improve services to both parents and thus legislative amendments are being made to support this aspiration.</p>

              <p>For some customers, the online service will not be a suitable channel in which to receive communication on their case. Our overall policy aim is to ensure that the right channel is used at the right time for our customers. As such, CMS will retain flexibility to meet the needs of vulnerable customers and their preferred method of communication such as postal or by telephone. A postal service will be retained for customers who choose to have their communications by post or for whom an online service is not appropriate. A customer can amend their contact preference at any point during the lifetime of the case. This can be done via My Child Maintenance Case<authorialNote marker="10"><p> My Child Maintenance Case Online offers a service for parents to manage their case online</p></authorialNote> or by contacting CMS</p>

We will also continue to send letters with serious consequences via a postal method alongside using electronic means; for example, a letter detailing our intention to remove a paying parent’s passport would be made available digitally and be posted. We will build in a period of review to monitor the outcome of the change to digital communications as an additional safeguard.</p>

If information is not provided in the first instance, it will be necessary for an inspector to visit the premises, using powers of entry, where the information is held.</p>

              <p>The following organisations will be added to the 2008 Regulations and will have a duty to provide information on request: the trustees, managers and administrators of personal pension schemes, academy proprietors, the Motor Insurers’ Bureau (or its officers) and persons engaged in investment management or share trading activities. </p>

              <p>In respect of academy proprietors, (known as academy trusts and relevant to England only), statutory responsibilities are generally applied through their Master Funding Agreement<authorialNote marker="11"><p> https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/academy-and-free-school-funding-agreements</p></authorialNote>. There are information sharing duties between academy proprietors and local authorities under their funding agreements. Although there is already a duty on local authorities to supply information to the CMS under the 2008 Regulations, requiring academies to provide this information directly to CMS will allow CMS to obtain information more easily.  This will enable CMS to reduce the time it takes to obtain information relevant to making child maintenance calculations and recovering child maintenance debt.  This will help parents receive payments sooner.</p>

The consultation invited comments to specific questions on our proposals to introduce electronic communications and expand the 2008 Regulations. 122 responses were received: 8 from organisations and 111 from private individuals, of which 29 identified themselves as paying parents and 40 as receiving parents. </p>

            <p>The changes to regulations will require these businesses to provide the information instead of needing a CMS agent to use powers of entry. The annual estimate of costs on private pension providers, academies, Motor Insurers’ Bureau and companies that offer, promote or sell investment management services or facilitate share trading who will now be required in law to give us information when we request it, is around £7,000 per year with multiple visits required. The new legal obligation may reduce costs to businesses by enabling information to be provided on initial request. </p>

            <p>The current process of sending physical letters costs £311,000 per month for clerical and system generated letters combined, giving an annual estimated cost of £3.7 million.  Up to 10% of CMS letters will continue to be sent clerically.  We anticipate that eventually, between 70% and 80 % of Child Maintenance Service (CMS) customers will opt to have their communications digitally, resulting in savings for the tax payer.  </p>
