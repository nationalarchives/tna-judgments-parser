            <p>The instrument amends four retained EU Regulations, all of which are retained direct minor EU legislation as defined in Section 7(6) of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. In this case, the regulations concerned have the status of retained direct minor EU legislation due to having been EU tertiary legislation immediately before exit day. </p>

          <num>2.2</num>
          <content>
            <p>These four regulations relate to aviation safety. They set requirements for initial and continuing airworthiness of aircraft, and for the operation of balloons and sailplanes. The amendments implement revised standards and recommended practices (“SARPs”) adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) in accordance with the Convention on International Civil Aviation (“the Chicago Convention”) and introduce other measures to improve the regulation of aviation safety. Overall, the purpose of the instrument is to deliver incremental improvements to safety standards, in line with international best practice. </p>

              <p>The Aviation Safety (Amendment) Regulations 2023 do not set new aviation safety standards, but amend Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 to place a requirement on organisations involved in the design or production of aeronautical products or parts to implement a Safety Management System (SMS) to ensure that existing aviation safety standards are met. An SMS requires a systematic approach to managing safety, including the necessary organisational structures, accountability, responsibilities, policies and procedures. The principles are set out in ICAO Document 9859<authorialNote marker="1"><p> <a href="https://www.icao.int/safety/safetymanagement/pages/guidancematerial.aspx"><u>https://www.icao.int/safety/safetymanagement/pages/guidancematerial.aspx</u></a> </p></authorialNote> and organised into four components:</p>

              <p>This requirement is needed to bring the retained regulation up to date and in line with international standards established in Annex 19 to the Chicago Convention, and ensure that the UK is compliant with those standards. This final stage in the process of meeting international standards will ensure better oversight and continuous improvement of aviation safety by bringing these organisations in line with other parts of the aviation sector.</p>

            <content>
              <p>These changes meet requirements that have been in place since 2013. When that initial deadline, of November 2013, passed, it was the responsibility of the EU Commission to introduce legislation. It did so, but did not fully meet requirements until 2021, which meant that amendments were not retained in UK law. Since the UK left the EU, work has been ongoing to achieve full compliance. Due to the need for detailed policy development at UK level, this represents the first opportunity to bring forward the necessary changes.</p>

            <content>
              <p>Some elements of this amendment will come into force on 1 July 2024 (see table at 7.23). This later date, as opposed to immediate implementation, reflects the fact that the effective implementation of an SMS takes time, and organisations require time to implement the new requirements safely and in a considered manner that meets their requirements, and allows time for CAA review and approval. Some of the impacted organisations are already implementing the required standards but will still need to go through the CAA approval process; others who need to implement from scratch will need additional time, as it is a significant undertaking to ensure an orderly transition to the enhanced system. </p>

            <content>
              <p>ICAO recognises that the maturity of all components and elements of the SMS framework may take several years to become effective. In the first year, the SMS system is expected to be in place and, recognising the need for orderly transition, organisations are expected to be compliant with the legislation from 1 July 2024 when the requirement comes into force. Until 1 July 2026, where CAA audits (to be conducted from 1 July 2024) of affected organisations’ SMS reveal non-conformances, organisations will have until 1 July 2026 to correct these. Any uncorrected findings after that date will result in that organisation’s approval certificate being either revoked, limited or suspended in whole or part.</p>

                <p>An alleviation from the requirement for all new parts to be released to service under a CAA Form 1 by an approved production organisation.

              <p>The Regulation is also amended to reflect the changes to Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 detailed in paragraph 7.8(ii) above. Where parts are no longer required to be released to service under a CAA Form 1, Part CAO organisations (continuous airworthiness organisations that carry out maintenance) with maintenance privileges will be permitted to maintain and fit such parts onto Part ML aircraft (i.e. ‘Light Aircraft’ in General Aviation). In practice, this means light General Aviation aircraft will be subject to a more proportionate oversight approach, given the lower risk profile associated with them.</p>

              <p>The instrument also introduces a definition of maintenance data to ensure consistency with retained Regulation (EU) No 748/2012. Some elements of this amendment will come into force on 21 June 2023 and others on 1 July 2024 (see table at 7.23 for details). Where additional time is needed prior to the coming into force date, this is to allow industry time to prepare and implement changes in advance of new regulations being in force – to ensure an orderly transition to the new system.</p>

To give a summary, referring to the “Purpose of the Amendment” section of page 1 of the Table of Proposed Amendments, the changes relating to Safety Management Systems and eligibility of parts and appliances for installation without a Form 1 (EOPF1) require a later coming into force date of 1 July 2024 to ensure there is time for industry to prepare and to ensure an orderly transition. The changes relating to ageing aircraft structures, rationalisation (except where linked to SMS amendments) and correction do not place new requirements on industry in terms of preparation, so can come into force immediately.</p>

              <p>The above-mentioned table gives an expected coming into force date of 1 January 2024, rather than the actual coming into force date of 1 July 2024. 1 January was the original date by which the provisions were expected to come into force, based on plans for this instrument being laid in 2022. As these changes took longer to finalise than expected, the current instrument was laid later than originally planned. The coming into force date has been moved correspondingly later. This is to ensure industry has sufficient time to prepare for the effect of these changes and is not expected to have a significant impact on safety.</p>

This was initiated after a consultation on “opportunities for General Aviation after leaving EASA” and will consider opportunities to simplify and rationalise the current licensing system whilst maintaining the appropriate level of safety.<authorialNote marker="3"><p> <a href="https://consultations.caa.co.uk/ga/uk-general-aviation-opportunities-after-easa/"><u>https://consultations.caa.co.uk/ga/uk-general-aviation-opportunities-after-easa/</u></a> </p></authorialNote></p>

              <p>Delaying the applicability of the requirement will remove the possibility of existing licence holders having to change their licences several times within a short space of time. No safety impact is anticipated, as the legacy system for licensing of balloons remains in place during the transition period, which ensures effective regulation is in place for the safe operation of balloons. Any changes made in light of the review will be subject to further consideration, including to ensure there is no impact on safety and to ensure there is appropriate transition to any new system.

This is for the same reasons set out in paragraph 7.15-7.19 regarding the amendment to Regulation 2018/395. As with that Regulation, the deadline is being extended from 8 December 2023 to 30 September 2025.

            <p>The changes made by this instrument, other than the minor changes set out in paragraphs 7.15 to 7.21, arise from work on the implementation of ICAO SARPs and general safety enhancements undertaken by EASA while the UK was a member of the EU. This involved two rounds of consultation. The UK fully participated in the development of the requirements and supported the position reached after the consultation had taken place. A consultation on the changes to the retained legislation has not taken place as the views of the aviation industry, which are generally supportive, were already known through the EASA consultation. </p>

            <p>The Department for Transport (DfT) has not published an impact assessment in relation to the introduction of Safety Management Systems in Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 and Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014. This is because the direct impacts on business have been assessed at under £5m per year and light-touch internal analysis has been conducted instead, the findings of which are presented below. </p>

            <p>It is estimated that the changes mentioned in the paragraph above have an Equivalent Annual Net Direct Cost to Businesses (EANDCB) of £0.04 million. It has been assessed that businesses will face transition costs as a result of the need to provide initial training to all employees, provide further training to nominated postholders, and undertake Exposition/Handbook updates. Ongoing costs for businesses will result from the additional work hours required to comply with SMS requirements. Government will face ongoing costs as a result of the requirement to fund the CAA’s oversight of SMS. Over a 10-year appraisal period, a total net present cost of £2.8 million is estimated.</p>

            <p>In relation to the other requirements introduced by the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 and to Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014, which set out the requirements for the continued airworthiness of aircraft and aeronautical products, DfT has not published an impact assessment, as the direct impacts on business have been assessed at under £5m per year. Many of the potentially affected organisations already satisfy the requirements of the policy, as required under the conditions of their third-party European approvals. For the remaining organisations, the policy is estimated to have an EANDCB of £0.21 million and therefore falls within the £5 million De Minimis Threshold. There is deemed to be no material risk of the realised cost exceeding the threshold, as the identified costs are substantially below this level, and there are no areas of uncertainty that could cause these costs to fluctuate by the orders of magnitude required.</p>
