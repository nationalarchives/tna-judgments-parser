        <content>
          <p>Currently, the ARB is able to determine who may be charged the fees set out in the 2022 Regulations as well has how those fees are calculated and paid. It is possible to interpret the section 24A of the Architects Act 1997, under which both the 2022 Regulations and this instrument are made, as requiring those matters to be set out in regulations. The Regulations therefore make changes to set out precisely who should be charged the fees described in the 2022 Regulations and how they should be paid. These changes are being made in order to avoid any potential for uncertainty around the legality of the ARB’s fee charging activities.   </p>

          <p>Currently, there is no requirement on the ARB to publish details about how the fees are calculated. The Regulations introduce a requirement on the ARB to publish details about how the fee amounts have been calculated in order to improve transparency.  </p>

        <num>5.3</num>
        <content>
          <p>The Regulations make minor changes to the 2022 Regulations. The overall policy of allowing the ARB to charge the fees set out in the 2022 Regulations has not changed. Rather, these regulations specify who should be charged those fees and how they should be paid, rather than delegating those decisions to ARB as the 2022 Regulations did. The Regulations also seek to improve transparency around ARB fees by requiring details about the fees’ calculation to be published. This will enable stakeholders to scrutinise the fees and ensure they are being charged on a cost-recovery basis only.</p>

          <p>No consultation was undertaken on the changes made by the Regulations. As above, the regulations make minor changes to the 2022 Regulations and the general policy has not changed. The Ministry previously conducted a public consultation on proposed amendments to the Architects Act 1997, together with new measures for international architects. The consultation received 404 responses from individuals and organisations. The Government’s response to the consultation was published on 8 June 2021 and can be found on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-proposed-amendments-to-the-architects-act-1997/outcome/government-response-to-the-consultation-on-proposed-amendments-to-the-architects-act-1997">gov</a>.uk.<authorialNote marker="1"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-proposed-amendments-to-the-architects-act-1997"><u>Consultation on proposed amendments to the Architects Act 1997 - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</u></a><u> - https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consultation-on-proposed-amendments-to-the-architects-act-1997</u></p></authorialNote> 49% of respondents agreed with the proposals for the ARB to be granted a power to charge fees for its services but the majority of respondents preferred for chargeable services to be listed in legislation.  </p>
