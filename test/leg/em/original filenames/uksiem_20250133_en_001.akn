          <p>These regulations amend the Communications (Television Licensing) Regulations 2004 (“the 2004 Regulations”) (S.I. 2004/692) to increase the level of the television licence fee in line with the Consumer Price Index. The licence fee shall be increased from £169.50 to £174.50 for a colour licence, and from £57.00 to £58.50 for a black and white licence. These regulations also increase the sums payable by way of instalments under the instalment schemes set out in the 2004 Regulations. </p>

          <p>Section 365 of the Communications Act 2003 Act grants the Secretary of State the power to determine the level of the television licence fee, though in practice the licence fee level is set by the Government in consultation with the BBC, as set out in clause 43 of the BBC Charter<authorialNote marker="1"><p> <a href="https://www.bbc.com/aboutthebbc/governance/charter"><u>https://www.bbc.com/aboutthebbc/governance/charter</u></a></p></authorialNote>. </p>

        <content>
          <p>Between 2017 and 2022, the Government used secondary legislation to increase the cost of the licence fee in line with inflation on an annual basis. Licence fee funding settlement negotiations took place in 2021/22 in accordance with clause 43 of the BBC’s Royal Charter. The Government agreed with the BBC that the television licence fee level would be frozen for two years before rising in line with inflation for the remainder of the settlement period. </p>

        <content>
          <p>Following the freeze between 2022 and 2024, the Communications (Television Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations 2024 reinstated this process. This legislation upholds the Government's 2022 commitment to increase the television licence fee in line with the Consumer Price Index annually from 2024 until 2027.</p>

          <p>There are no plans for consultations on this legislation. The licence fee funding model itself was considered as part of the BBC Charter Review in 2015<authorialNote marker="2"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/bbc-charter-review-public-consultation"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/bbc-charter-review-public-consultation</u></a></p></authorialNote>. The consultation found that the majority of respondents did not want to see a change in the way the BBC is funded: 60% thought the current licence fee model did not need to be changed. The Government committed to maintain the current model for the duration of the Charter (until 31 December 2027). </p>
