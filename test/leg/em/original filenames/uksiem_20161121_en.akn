The aim of the cross-party talks was to secure the implementation of the December 2014 Stormont House Agreement<authorialNote marker="3"><p> https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-stormont-house-agreement</p></authorialNote> and deal with the impact of continued paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland. The Fresh Start Agreement seeks to make progress towards fulfilling these objectives.  The Fresh Start Agreement strongly reaffirms support for the rule of law, places fresh obligations on Northern Ireland’s elected representatives to work together on their shared objective of ridding society of all forms of paramilitary activity and groups, and commits to a concerted and enhanced effort to combat organised crime and cross border crime.</p>

            <p>The Fresh Start Agreement includes a series of measures to end paramilitarism and tackle organised crime, including the establishment of the Commission.  The Commission will report on progress towards ending continuing paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland, report on the implementation of the relevant measures of the three administrations; and consult with a wide range of statutory agencies, communities and civic society organisations.  It is intended that reports of the Commission will inform future Northern Ireland Executive Programme for Government priorities and commitments through to 2021.  It is intended that the Commission will be established by early January 2017.</p>

          <content>
            <p>Section 3(1) and (2) of 2016 Act confers immunity from suit and legal process, and inviolability of its official archive, on the Commission itself, subject to the Commission having the ability to waive these.   In summary, this was due to reasons related to the ability of the Commission to fulfil its functions successfully, including the following.   First, to help protect the Commission’s independence from either Government.  Second, to protect it from challenge from others who may be the subject of its reports (e.g. the paramilitary groups whose activities the Commission will monitor progress to tackle).   Third, absent these immunities, there would be a risk that the Commission would become bogged down in litigation and be unable fully to discharge its functions which are intended to be carried out, at least initially, over a limited period of time.<i>  </i>Fourth, the immunities from suit and legal process also serve to make sure that the Commission is able to receive the information it needs to accurately assess progress towards ending paramilitary activity connected with Northern Ireland, and therefore are central to the fulfilment of its functions.  A body such as the Commission cannot operate if contributors perceive a risk of the information they contribute, or the identity of its source, being disclosed and if contributors decline to engage with the body, this would have a detrimental effect on the ability of the Commission to perform its functions successfully. <br />For similar reasons, in order to enable the Commission to fulfil its functions successfully, the effect of these Regulations is to confer on members of the Commission and members of staff of the Commission, including agents of, and persons carrying out work for, or giving advice to, the Commission, immunity from suit and legal process in respect of things done or omitted to be done by them in the course of the performance of their official duties.    (This was also the case, for example, with members and members of staff of, and agents and other persons carrying out work for or giving advice to, the Independent Monitoring Commission, see the Northern Ireland (Monitoring Commission etc.) Act 2003 (Immunities and Privileges) Order 2003).   It is possible for the Commission itself to expressly waive the immunity from suit or legal process given to a person under these Regulations, for example, in the event of an employment or health and safety dispute.  We do not expect it to do so in respect of its official functions.</p>

            <p>In addition, these Regulations provide that unless they are (a) a British citizen, British overseas territories citizen, British Overseas citizen or a British National (Overseas), or (b) a permanent resident of the United Kingdom at the time of becoming a member of the Commission of member of staff of the Commission, members of the Commission and members of staff of the Commission (other than agents and other persons carrying out work for, or giving advice to, the Commission)  will also be exempt from income tax and will not make social security related contributions whilst employed by the Commission.   This is consistent with provision made in relation to other international organisations, and is consistent with the position in relation to the Independent Monitoring Commission (see the Northern Ireland (Monitoring Commission etc.) Act 2003 (Immunities and Privileges) Order 2003).</p>

            <p>No guidance is intended to be issued directly on these Regulations.   However, under section 2(5) of the 2016, the Secretary of State must issue guidance about the exercise of the Commission’s functions in relation to information the disclosure of which might (a) prejudice the national security interests of the United Kingdom, or (b) put at risk the life or safety of any person.   The Northern Ireland Office is discussing this with stakeholders and will issue the guidance to the Commission, in time for the Commission starting its work, and has committed to placing a copy of the guidance in the Library of each House of Parliament.</p>
