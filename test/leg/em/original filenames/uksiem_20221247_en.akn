              <p>As noted in section 2 of this Explanatory Memorandum, this instrument is made under section 8 of EUWA. Section 8(8) of EUWA states that no regulations may be made under section 8 of EUWA after the end of the period of two years beginning with IP completion day. IP completion day was 31 December 2020, so the power to make regulations under section 8 of EUWA will lapse on 31 December 2022. </p>

              <p>While, in compliance with section 8(8) of EUWA, this instrument will be made prior to 31 December 2022, Part 2 of this instrument (which amends the 2003 Regulations) will not come into force until 1 April 2023. It has proved necessary to have a later coming into force date to ensure that the changes coincide with the start of the industry reporting year, which runs from 1 April to 31 March. This approach ensures that industry will not face unnecessary costs and administrative burdens as a result of the change and was supported by the majority of stakeholders as well as Ofgem (the UK energy regulator) in their responses to the public consultation (see section 10 of this Explanatory Memorandum). It also gives industry increased notice of the change and allows electricity suppliers to adapt their procedures and guarantees of origin (“GOO”) purchasing strategies appropriately.  </p>

The GOO Regulations therefore constitute retained EU law under section 2(1) of EUWA. </p>

              <p>GOOs are certificates used by electricity suppliers to demonstrate that a portion of supplied electricity is renewable or from a high-efficiency cogeneration (or CHP). In Great Britain, GOOs for renewable electricity (“REGOs”) and CHP (“CHP GOOs”) operate under separate schemes<authorialNote marker="5"><p> Northern Ireland operates its own schemes with separate regulations under which Ofgem and Secretary of State for Energy and Industrial Strategy issue renewable energy and CHP Northern Ireland GOOs respectively.</p></authorialNote>.</p>

              <p>In Great Britain, CHP GOOs are issued by the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy and can be used by electricity producers to increase transparency, so that customers for electricity can differentiate between electricity generated by high-efficiency cogeneration (or CHP) and electricity produced using other techniques. CHP GOOs do not by themselves imply any right to public support. Indeed, they are not and have not been used in the UK as the basis for providing public support for CHP (the CHPQA scheme administrates government support for CHP).</p>

This instrument remedies this deficiency in Great Britain by removing the obligations to recognise GOOs issued in an EU member State and by removing references to such GOOs being recognised in Great Britain.</p>

As this instrument addresses deficiencies in the 2003 Regulations arising from the UK’s withdrawal from the European Union, the consultation sought views on timings for implementation/ending non-mutual reciprocity only. A strong majority of those who responded (over 70%) chose 1 April 2023 as their preferred implementation date.</p>

            <p>The Minister of State for Climate, Graham Stuart, has made the following statement regarding use of legislative powers in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018:</p>
            <p>“The Guarantees of Origin of Electricity Produced from Renewable Energy Sources and High-efficiency Cogeneration (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2022 should be subject to annulment in pursuance of a resolution of either House of Parliament (i.e. the negative procedure)”. </p>
            <blockContainer>
              <num>16.1</num>
              <p>This is the case because this instrument does not fall into the category of regulations identified in paragraph 1(2) of the Schedule 7 to the European Withdrawal Act 2018 as requiring approval in draft by resolution of both Houses of Parliament. This instrument amends the Electricity (Guarantees of Origin of Electricity Produced from Renewable Energy Sources) Regulations 2003 and the Guarantees of Origin of Electricity Produced from High-efficiency Cogeneration Regulations 2007 following the UK’s withdrawal from the EU as set out in Section 7, Policy Background, of this Explanatory Memorandum. We do not consider that there is any reason why they should not be subject to the negative resolution procedure.</p>

            <p>The Minister of State for Climate, Graham Stuart, has made the following statement regarding use of legislative powers in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018:</p>
            <p>“In my view the Guarantees of Origin of Electricity Produced from Renewable Energy Sources and High-efficiency Cogeneration (Amendment) (EU Exit) Regulations 2022 does no more than is appropriate”. </p>
            <blockContainer>
              <num>17.1</num>
              <p>This is the case because this instrument only removes provision for a reciprocal arrangement between the UK and the EU which no longer exists, i.e. the mutual recognition of GOOs. The GOO Regulations will otherwise continue to have effect in the same way as they did prior to the making of this instrument.</p>

            <p>The Minister of State for Climate, Graham Stuart, has made the following statement regarding use of legislative powers in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018:</p>
            <p>“In my view there are good reasons for the provisions in this instrument, and I have concluded they are a reasonable course of action”. </p>
            <blockContainer>
              <num>18.1</num>
              <p>These are that EU has ceased to recognise UK GOOs as a result of the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, so it is appropriate for designated authorities in Great Britain to cease recognising EU GOOs in line with the UK government’s public commitments. This instrument does not impose any new policies, liabilities, or obligations on any relevant persons. The policy rationale for the changes is set out in Section 7, Policy Background, of this Explanatory Memorandum.</p>

            <p>The Minister of State for Climate, Graham Stuart, has made the following statement(s):</p>
            <p>“The draft instrument does not amend, repeal or revoke a provision or provisions in the Equality Act 2006 or the Equality Act 2010 or subordinate legislation made under those Acts.” </p>
            <p>The Minister of State for Climate, Graham Stuart, has made the following statement regarding use of legislative powers in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018:</p>
            <p>“In relation to the draft instrument, I, Graham Stuart, have had due regard to the need to eliminate discrimination, harassment, victimisation and any other conduct that is prohibited by or under the Equality Act 2010.”</p>

              <num>19.1</num>
              <p>The revocation made by this instrument does not raise any issues relevant to the public sector equality duty under section 149(1) of the Equality Act 2010 because they are minor and technical and do not impose new policies, liabilities, or obligations on any relevant persons.</p>
