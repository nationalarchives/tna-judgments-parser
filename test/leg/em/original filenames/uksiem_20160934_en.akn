            <p>The Localism Act 2011 provided a statutory regime for neighbourhood planning.

But these Regulations are the first use of the specific power at sub-paragraph (2)(c) of that paragraph to prescribe a date by which the referendum must be held.</p>

            <p>Chapter 3 of Part 6 of the Localism Act 2011 (“the 2011 Act”) created the neighbourhood planning regime in England mainly by inserting new provisions into the 1990 Act and the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 (“the 2004 Act”) (<i>see</i> Part 1 of Schedule 9 and Schedules 10 and 11 of the 2011 Act, for the provisions inserted into the 1990 Act, and Part 2 of Schedule 9 of the 2011 Act for the provisions inserted into the 2004 Act).</p>

            <p>Before a neighbourhood development plan or neighbourhood development order (including a community right to build order) can be made by a local planning authority, it must be voted on by the local community in a referendum. Where the neighbourhood area has been designated as a business area there must be an additional referendum for the businesses. A relevant council (defined at paragraph 14(3) of Schedule 4B to the 1990 Act) must make arrangements for the referendum or referendums to take place in so much of their area as falls within the referendum area.</p>

            <p>Once a local planning authority has decided, following an independent examination of a proposal for a neighbourhood development plan or order (including a community right to build order), that the proposal should proceed to referendum, the Government is keen to ensure that the referendum takes place as quickly as possible.  Delays in holding the referendum date can cause frustration for communities.</p>

          <num>7.2</num>
          <content>
            <p>These Regulations prescribe a time period of 56 working days within which the referendum must be held in most cases.  Where the neighbourhood area is designated as a business area, where more than one relevant council must arrange a referendum, and areas where the local planning authority responsible for neighbourhood planning is not the relevant council responsible for arranging the referendum (such as in National Parks or Mayoral Development Corporations), a longer period of 84 working days applies. These time periods are intended to allow sufficient time for the local authority to prepare the required Information Statement and other documents prescribed under regulation 4 of the 2012 Regulations, including time for liaison between authorities in cross-boundary area and where the local planning authority is not the relevant council.</p>

        <paragraph>
          <num>7.3</num>
          <intro>
            <p>There are three exceptions to where the prescribed date does not apply.  First, where the local planning authority and the neighbourhood group agree a date for the referendum to be held that is later than the prescribed date.  This may be, for example, because there is an event that the neighbourhood group wishes to align the referendum with to help encourage turnout. Secondly, where there is another poll due to be held within three months of the prescribed date, and the neighbourhood planning referendum can take place on the same day (whether or not combined with that poll).  This may enable the relevant council to make cost savings, for example by using the same polling station for both polls.  It may also help encourage turnout.  Thirdly, where there are legal challenges to the decision to hold a referendum. Although the prescribed date does not apply in this case, it is for each relevant council to decide, in the light of their own legal advice where necessary, whether to proceed with the referendum.</p>

            <p>The Department  formally consulted on a number of reforms to the regulations governing neighbourhood planning from 18 February 2016 to 15 April 2016 (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/implementation-of-planning-changes-technical-consultation"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/implementation-of-planning-changes-technical-consultation</u></a>). There were over 800 responses to the consultation of which 362 commented on the proposal to prescribe a date by which a referendum must be held.  Just under half of those respondents represented local planning authorities and around a quarter were from parish councils.</p>

          <num>8.2</num>
          <content>
            <p>The consultation document proposed a time period of 10 weeks (in most neighbourhood areas) and 14 weeks (in business areas.  In these Regulations the time periods have been expressed as working days and adjusted slightly to align with the “referendum period” under regulation 4 of the 2012 Regulations.</p>

        <paragraph>
          <num>8.3</num>
          <content>
            <p>Over two thirds of local authorities supported the time periods proposed in the consultation and the proposed circumstances where the prescribed time period would not apply. Some consultees suggested other situations in which the longer time period should apply, and these have been taken into account in these Regulations. There was very strong support from parish councils, house builders and professional bodies.  A report of the consultation is being prepared and will be placed in the Library of each House of Parliament and on the Department for Communities and Local Government website (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/department-for-communities-and-local-government</u></a>).</p>

            <p>Neighbourhood planning is a voluntary activity; it is for individual organisations – parish councils or community organisations or businesses – to choose to produce, lead or participate in the production of a neighbourhood development plan or neighbourhood development order (including a community right to build order).  There is no new additional direct cost to businesses or civil society organisations arising from the reforms.</p>

            <p>Funding has been identified to support those local authorities that incur additional burdens as a result of the duties imposed under the 1990 Act and 2004 Act in relation to neighbourhood planning.  We do not consider that our reforms are introducing a requirement for additional administration or expenditure by relevant councils. They are required to arrange a referendum in any event and these Regulations simply prescribe a date by which the referendum must be held. It will still be possible to combine polls that are due to take place within a reasonable period of the date prescribed in these Regulations. Therefore our current arrangements for meeting any new burdens are sufficient.</p>
