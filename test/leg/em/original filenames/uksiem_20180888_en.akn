            <p>Section 1 of the Act established the Statistics Board, whose function it is to promote and safeguard the production and publication of official statistics that serve the public good (section 7 of the Act). Under section 6(1)(a) of the Act, all statistics produced by the Statistics Board, government departments, the Scottish Administration, a Welsh ministerial authority, a Northern Ireland department and other Crown bodies are “official statistics”. This Order is made under section 6(1)(b) and (2) of the Act, which allows orders to be made to specify statistics produced or to be produced by other persons or descriptions of persons as official statistics.</p>

            <p>This Order is made under section 6(1)(b) and (2) of the Act and is the fifth use of this order-making power by a Minister of the Crown. The last such use of the power was in May 2013 when the Official Statistics Order 2013 (“the 2013 Order”) was made. The 2013 Order had in turn been amended by S.I. 2013/2329, S.I. 2014/549 and S.I. 2017/1250, each removing one body (namely the National Lottery Commission, Competition Commission and Independent Police Complaints Commission respectively) and the third also adding one (namely the Independent Office for Police Conduct). The 2013 Order is revoked by this Order. This Order updates the list of (non-Crown body) producers of important, national-level statistics which the Minister for the Cabinet Office considers should be specified as official statistics.</p>

The Official Statistics (Scotland) Order 2008 (S.S.I. 2008/131, amended by S.S.I 2010/448 and S.S.I. 2012/196) specifies the wholly Scottish devolved statistics produced by certain persons as official statistics. Similarly, the Official Statistics (Northern Ireland) Order 2012 (S.R. 2012 No. 2) specifies the wholly Northern Ireland devolved statistics produced by certain persons as official statistics. The terms “wholly Scottish devolved statistics” and “wholly Northern Ireland devolved statistics” are further used in section 11 of the Act. </p>

This includes any wholly Welsh devolved statistics they produce or will produce. Separately, the Official Statistics (Wales) Order 2017 (S.I. 2017/1142 (W. 284)) specifies additional wholly Welsh devolved statistics as official statistics.</p>

            <p>From December 2007, the Act established the Statistics Board (a non-ministerial department which has chosen to operate under the name “UK Statistics Authority”) to promote and safeguard the production and publication of official statistics that serve the public good. The definition of official statistics in the Act allows flexibility to add or remove non-Crown bodies from the Statistics Board’s remit by order. This Order provides an updated list of bodies whose statistical activities will be monitored, scrutinised and reported on by the Board.</p>

            <p>This Order specifies the statistics produced, or to be produced, by the persons listed in the Schedule as official statistics. It revokes the 2013 Order and revises the list of persons set out in the Schedule to that Order. Bodies included in the list are those which produce, or will produce, national-level statistics which (a) inform the public about the social or economic position of the country, (b) are likely to be used to judge government performance or targets or (c) the government considers it is otherwise important that the public has particular trust in.</p>

Further, there would be one body whose entry did not reflect its new legal name.

            <p>An order under section 6(1)(b) and (2) of the Act may be made by any Minister of the Crown, but the Government thinks the most efficient use is made of Parliamentary time, and that the legislation is clearer and more accessible if, in general, a Cabinet Office Minister makes such an order on a regular basis, producing a consolidated list of bodies including those sponsored by other government departments.</p>

            <p>As required by section 6(3) of the Act, the Statistics Board has been consulted on this Order. The formal consultation took place in May 2018. The Board confirmed by letter dated 15 May 2018 that it was content for the Government to proceed the proposed Order.</p>

            <p>Bodies that have been newly included in the Order have been consulted. That consultation has been carried out by the statistical Head of Profession (or the statistical team) in each relevant Government department contacting those bodies which are sponsored by that department. The bodies listed in the Order which were also listed in the 2013 Order were consulted at the time they were first added to the list and so have not necessarily been consulted again for the purposes of this Order.</p>

            <p>The Statistics Board published its Code of Practice for Official Statistics in January 2009, and updated it in February 2018, with the Code of Practice for Statistics. Producers of official statistics – including those bodies specified in this Order – are expected to follow the Code as a matter of good practice. Producers of National Statistics (that is those official statistics which the Statistics Board designates as “National Statistics” under section 12(2) of the Act) are required to follow the Code in full in relation to those statistics. It is the responsibility of the Board to maintain, update and enforce this Code.</p>

            <p>The impact on the public sector is expected to be negligible because the organisations newly named in the Order will have to make only very small changes to their operations – if any – in order to comply with greater scrutiny from the Board. The costs associated with these changes will also be negligible.  </p>

            <p>This instrument is intended to allow the Statistics Board to fulfil its duties, in particular with regard to improving public trust in official statistics. The Government expects to update the list of (non-Crown body) producers of official statistics by order as required. In doing so the Government will take advice from the Board and will also consider comments on the scope of the Board’s remit made by other bodies (for example comments made by Parliament as part of its scrutiny of the Board’s activities).</p>
