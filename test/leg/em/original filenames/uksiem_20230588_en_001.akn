            <p>The instrument amends four retained EU Regulations, all of which are retained direct minor EU legislation, relating to aviation safety (in particular initial and continuing airworthiness, balloons and sailplanes). The amendments implement revised standards and recommended practices (“SARPs”) adopted by the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) in accordance with the Convention on International Civil Aviation (“the Chicago Convention”) and introduce other measures to improve the regulation of aviation safety.</p>

            <p>Regulation (EU) No 2018/1139 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2018 on common rules in the field of civil aviation and establishing a European Union Aviation Safety Agency (“the Basic Regulation”) as amended by S.I. 2019/645 establishes a framework and essential requirements in respect of aviation safety regulation.  In particular, it provides for the implementation of the SARPs contained in the Annexes (as amended from time to time) to the Chicago Convention. </p>

            <p>The Basic Regulation, as retained in UK law, contains regulation making powers for the Secretary of State to make and amend detailed regulations in respect of aviation safety to ensure compliance with the essential requirements set out in the Annexes to the Regulation and to meet the general objectives of the Regulation. This instrument is made in exercise of the regulation making powers set out in Articles 17 and 19 (airworthiness), 23 (pilots), 62 (certification, oversight and enforcement) and 127(3) (regulations) of the Basic Regulation.</p>

                <p>This Regulation establishes the requirements for the approval of organisations responsible of the design or production of aeronautical products (aircraft, engines or propellors) and parts. It also establishes the type certification (design approval) requirements for products and parts and the release to service of individual products and parts that are newly produced. </p>

              <num>7.2</num>
              <content>
                <p>The instrument amends the Regulation to require organisations designing or producing products or parts to implement a safety management system (“SMS”). A SMS requires a systematic approach to managing safety, including the necessary organisational structures, accountability, responsibilities, policies and procedures. This implements the international standards established in Annex 19 to the Chicago Convention. While the retained EU legislation already sets out requirements for the management systems of these organisations, these do not fully meet the Annex 19 requirements for SMS. Organisations in most other areas of aviation are already required to have SMS, but the Annex 19 deadline, of November 2013, has been missed in respect of design and production organisations and aircraft maintenance organisations. Prior to EU exit, it was the responsibility of the EU commission to introduce legislation meeting this requirement. The development of amendments to EU requirements to address the deficiencies was largely complete at the time of EU Exit, but the legislation was not adopted at EU level until late in 2021, and so was not retained in UK law. Since we left the EU, we want to ensure we comply with ICAO standards so have been working to move to compliance on this, but we have had to make prioritisation decisions regarding regulatory changes, so are bringing this forward now.</p>

                  <p>An alleviation from the requirement for all new parts released to service under a CAA Form 1 by an approved production organisation. This will apply where the Civil Aviation Authority (“the CAA”) determine that a part does not have an impact on safety. It will allow replacement parts to be produced or maintained by non-approved organisations and should lower costs for industry without compromising safety.</p>

                <p>The instrument amends the Regulation to extend the deadline by which balloon pilots with licences issued under the Air Navigation Order 2016 (“the ANO”) have to hold a Balloon Pilot Licence issued under the Regulation. The CAA is undertaking a post-EU Exit review of private pilot licensing which may result in significant changes to licensing requirements. Delaying the applicability of the requirement will remove the possibility of existing licence holders having to change their licences several times within a short space of time. In light of this, the instrument amends the Regulation to establish a new deadline of 31st December 2025 for obtaining a licence issued under the Regulation. </p>

            <p>The changes made by this instrument, other than the minor changes set out in paragraphs 7.8 to 7.11, arise from work on the implementation of ICAO SARPs and general safety enhancements undertaken by EASA while the UK was a member of the EU. This involved two rounds of consultation. The UK fully participated in the development of the requirements and supported the position reached after the consultation had taken place. A consultation on the changes to the retained legislation has not taken place as the views of the aviation industry, which are generally supportive, were already known through the EASA consultation. </p>

            <p>The changes outlined in paragraphs 7.8 to 7.11 have not been subject to consultation. However, the CAA has consulted on the principle of simplifying the private pilot licensing system, including balloon and glider pilot licensing and this is generally supported.  The report of that consultation can be found at <a href="https://consultations.caa.co.uk/corporate-communications/ga-pilot-licensing-training-phase-1/"><u>https://consultations.caa.co.uk/corporate-communications/ga-pilot-licensing-training-phase-1/</u></a>. </p>

            <p>The Department for Transport (DfT) has not published an impact assessment in relation to the introduction of safety management systems in Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 and Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014. This is because the direct impacts on business have been assessed at under £5m per year and light-touch internal analysis has been conducted instead, the findings of which are presented below. </p>

            <p>It is estimated that the changes mentioned in the paragraph above have an Equivalent Annual Net Direct Cost to Businesses (EANDCB) of £0.04 million. It has been assessed that businesses will face transition costs as a result of the need to provide initial training to all employees, provide further training to nominated postholders, and undertake Exposition/Handbook updates. Ongoing costs for businesses will result from the additional work hours required to comply with SMS requirements. Government will face ongoing costs as a result of the requirement to fund the CAA’s oversight of SMS. Over a 10-year appraisal period, a total net present cost of £2.8 million is estimated.</p>

            <p>In relation to the other requirements introduced by the amendments to Regulation (EU) No 748/2012 and to Regulation (EU) No 1321/2014, which set out the requirements for the continued airworthiness of aircraft and aeronautical products, DfT has not published an impact assessment, as the direct impacts on business have been assessed at under £5m per year. Many of the potentially affected organisations already satisfy the requirements of the policy, as they are required to under the conditions of their third-party European approvals. For the remaining organisations, we estimate that the policy has an EANDCB of £0.21 million and therefore falls within the £5 million De Minimis Threshold. There is deemed to be no material risk of the realised cost exceeding the threshold, as the identified costs are substantially below this level, and there are no areas of uncertainty that could cause these costs to fluctuate by the orders of magnitude required.</p>
