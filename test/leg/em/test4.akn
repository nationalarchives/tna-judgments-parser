            <p>A SCT is a series of images representing the 3D pattern of layers of conducting, insulating and semiconducting material that make up a semiconductor product (for example circuit boards). The functions of semiconductor products depend to a large part on these patterns and they are relatively easy to copy.</p>

            <p>The European Commission considered that semiconductor technology was essential for the Community's industrial development. In 1987 the Council Directive 87/54/EEC <authorialNote marker="1"><p> <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31987L0054&amp;from=EN"><u>https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:31987L0054&amp;from=EN</u></a> </p></authorialNote>provided a legal framework for the protection of topographies of semiconductor products.

            <p>In the UK, the law treats SCTs as a form of unregistered design right. The Regulations set out how Part 3 (Design Right) of the Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988 shall be applied to SCTs. They were made under s2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972. In addition, the WTO TRIPS agreement requires members to protect these products.</p>
