          <content>
            <p>The Common Fisheries Policy (“CFP”) imposes a common approach to the sustainable management of fisheries across the EU and its waters. A number of statutory instruments made in 2019 under powers in the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 made amendments to EU CFP legislation that was scheduled to become ‘retained EU law’ on exit day. The amendments were intended to ensure the retained CFP legislation would operate effectively upon the UK’s withdrawal from the EU. Following ratification of the EU withdrawal agreement, EU CFP legislation will now become retained EU law at the end of the Transition Period and this instrument is required to ensure retained EU law operates effectively from that point.</p>

            <p>The Government remains committed to maintaining existing standards of effective fisheries management. This instrument is required to ensure that after the end of the Transition Period there is immediate continuity in regulation, and the same environmental standards are met. In accordance with the provisions of section 8 of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, all amendments to the CFP have arisen as a result of the UK’s departure from the EU and therefore the amendments do not represent any changes in policy regarding fisheries management. Over time, the fisheries administrations will amend retained EU law in order to implement their own policies.</p>

          <content>
            <p>Fisheries management is largely devolved to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland in relation to their vessels and their waters. Therefore, where provisions place obligations on EU member States to do something, these references are mostly changed to “a fisheries administration”, which is a term defined in amendments made by the Common Fisheries Policy (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 that applies to all of the retained CFP Regulations.</p>

            <p>The definition ensures that “a fisheries administration” means the Secretary of State, a devolved fisheries administration or the Marine Management Organisation, and “a devolved fisheries administration” means the Scottish Ministers, the Welsh Ministers or, in Northern Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs. This definition has the effect of preserving the status quo, so that the administration which currently carries out the function in question, or which exercises the power in question, continues to do so. New functions which have not previously been exercisable at member State level have been transferred in accordance with the joint decision-making framework agreed with the Devolved Administrations to complement the current position. </p>

            <p>In addition to amending retained EU law, this instrument also amends previous EU exit statutory instruments in consequence of the ratification of the EU withdrawal agreement. In particular, the EU withdrawal agreement contains provisions which apply elements of EU legislation directly in the UK after the end of the Transition Period. EU exit statutory instruments made prior to the EU withdrawal agreement were drafted on the basis that such EU legislation would form part of retained EU law. However, the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020 ensures that there will not be duplication of retained EU law and EU law which applies directly by virtue of the EU withdrawal agreement. As such, the amendments made in this instrument in consequence of the EU withdrawal agreement revoke previous deficiency corrections to retained EU law in this area as the retained EU law will no longer be created by operation of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.</p>

            <p>This instrument is being made using the power in section 8 of, and paragraph 21 of Schedule 7 to, the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 in order to address failures of retained EU law to operate effectively or other deficiencies arising from the withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union. In accordance with the requirements of that Act the Minister has made the relevant statements as detailed in Part 2 of Annex A to this explanatory memorandum.</p>

The amendments made by the instrument will ensure UK vessels are subject to largely the same rules they are now.

            <p>This is appropriate because: the power to amend the data collection work plan which sits under the data collection framework regulation should be exercisable administratively rather than by statutory instrument (as set out in Annex B to this explanatory memorandum). The data collection work plan itself is not a statutory instrument and the amendment power contains a safeguard to ensure that the document cannot be amended in a manner which is inconsistent with the legislation it sits under, as well as an obligation to publish any amendments.</p>

                  <p />
                  <p>In relation to the seabass fishing management measures in Article 10, this instrument amends the time periods for the fishing restrictions and derogations as these are written into the EU text specifically for 2020 with a transitional provision in Article 54 which states that the provisions continue into 2021 until replaced by next year’s quota regulation. As the UK will not be subject to next year’s quota regulation, the relevant provisions will instead be extended by this instrument to apply in 2021 in the same way they applied in 2020.

This list is an EU-wide list whereby the specific surveys are split across the various member States (often including individually split surveys and cost-sharing arrangements). The Decision, however, makes it clear that it is each member State’s individual data collection work plan which sets out the surveys that a member State will be responsible for. As such, this instrument amends the Decision to remove the EU-wide list of mandatory research surveys and the thresholds and instead confirm that the relevant surveys are those specified in the UK’s data collection work plan. </p>

                  <p>The amendments replace references to ‘Union waters’ and ‘fisheries’ with ‘UK waters’ etc. These ensures that surveys are required to be carried out within UK waters, and on UK fishing boats fishing within and outside of UK waters where appropriate.  </p>

                  <p>It deletes previous deficiency corrections to the 2017/2019 data collection multiannual programme as this Commission Implementing Decision was revoked by the EU and replaced with the 2020-2021 multiannual programme amended above.</p>
                  <p />
                  <p>It updates previous amendments to the data collection framework regulation (2017/1004) to complement the amendments made to the new data collection multiannual programme – the amendments which provide for the relevant research surveys and thresholds to be those set out in the data collection work plan.</p>
                  <p />
                  <p>It also adds new provisions to the data collection framework regulation which were previously added to regulation (EU) 508/2014 (the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund “EMFF” Regulation).  The provisions in question are provisions which provide the Secretary of State with the power to amend the data collection work plan (with the consent of the devolved administrations where necessary).  These were previously amendments to Article 21 of the EMFF Regulation but following the EU withdrawal agreement there will no longer be a retained EU law version of the EMFF Regulation to amend.  As the data collection work plan will continue to be used outside the framework of the 2014-2020 EMFF, the most appropriate place to put these amendment powers is in the data collection framework regulation itself.  As the data collection work plan is not a statutory instrument, the power to amend it will be an administrative rather than a legislative power.</p>

                  <p>This instrument makes a number of amendments to a previous EU exit statutory instrument (2019/739) as follows:</p>
                  <p />
                  <p>An amendment is made to change references to ‘exit day’ to ‘IP completion day’ which has the legal meaning of 11pm 31st December 2020 as found in section 39(1) of the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020.</p>
                  <p />
                  <p>It amends the original deficiency corrections to the Common Fisheries Policy Regulation (1380/2013) to correct an error in the original definition of ‘British fishery limits’ which was inserted into the Regulation. This is required because the previous definition only set an outer limit and not an area of the sea; and, secondly, on the assumption that it would be interpreted as the sea within BFL, it does not exclude Isle of Man territorial waters from scope.  The replacement definition made by this amendment resolves both of these issues.</p>
                  <p />
                  <p>Amendments are made to the original deficiency corrections to the Control Regulation (1224/2009) to account for the fact that Article 45 of the IUU regulation (2008/1005) was revoked but, in error, corresponding references to it in the control regulation were not. Similarly, an amendment is made to the original deficiency corrections to the CMO Regulation (1379/2013) to account for the fact that Articles 30 and 31 have been revoked but, in error, a reference to these Articles was not.</p>
                  <p />
                  <p>Part 9 of the previous EU exit statutory instrument is revoked by this instrument in its entirety. Part 9 contained the original deficiency corrections to the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund “EMFF” Regulation. Following the ratification of the EU withdrawal agreement, the EMFF Regulation and associated provisions will no longer form part of retained EU law. This is due to Article 138 of the EU withdrawal agreement which provides that the relevant EMFF legislation will continue to apply directly in the United Kingdom to govern the wind down of the 2014-2020 EMFF programme. As such, this instrument revokes all previous deficiency corrections to the EMFF suite of legislation as there will no longer be retained EU law in this area to amend. For the same reason, this instrument also revokes a number of entries in the Schedule to the previous EU exit SI.

Whereas previously the amendments made changes to the 2015 Regulations in consequence of deficiency corrections made to the retained EU law, now those deficiency corrections will be revoked so those consequential changes should also be undone.  Furthermore, as the EMFF Regulation is being repealed and replaced at the EU level on 1st January, the cross reference in the 2015 Regulations for the purposes of the MMO grant making power is amended to ensure there is no ambiguity and that the purposes for which grants can continue to be made are those set out in the EMFF Regulation as it has effect immediately before IP completion day. </p>

In particular, they made amendments in relation to the aspects of the common provisions regulation which govern the EMFF.  This instrument amends the previous EU exit amendment Regulations to remove deficiency corrections which relate to the EMFF now that the EMFF aspects of the common provisions regulation will not form part of retained EU law.  This instrument does not remove the other previous deficiency corrections made to the common provisions regulation in relation to funding for rural development because those provisions will be treated differently due to other provisions contained in relevant rural development legislation.</p>

                  <p>This previous EU exit amendment SI is amended to alter the powers available to create, or amend existing, discard exemptions from the landing obligation (‘discard plans’).  The original approach to these powers was for each of the fisheries administrations to be able to exercise them independently within their area of competence.  However, following further consultation with the devolved administrations, it was agreed that there would be benefits if the Secretary of State also had the ability to exercise this power for the whole of the UK (provided the devolved administrations consent where the exercise of the power would fall within devolved competence). As such, this instrument amends the previous deficiency corrections to maintain the previous powers but also add in this additional UK-wide power for the Secretary of State.</p>

                  <p>Omitting Chapter 8 of Part 5 also removes previous deficiency corrections which relate to the EMFF for the reasons set out above.</p>

                  <p />
                  <p>The first amendment corrects an error, where an entire provision was deleted when only the part which specifies a minimum mesh size for the Skagerrak and Kattegat should have been deleted.</p>
                  <p />
                  <p>A further amendment takes the same approach as above with the discard plan powers. The powers in question here also relate to discard exemptions from the landing obligation.  As above, whereas these powers were originally created in the deficiency corrections to be exercisable by the fisheries administrations individually, they are amended to allow the Secretary of State to exercise them (to make amendments to the (or create a new) North Sea discard plan (currently 2019/2238)) for the whole of the UK with the consent of the DAs where necessary.  This mirrors the change made to the Common Fisheries Policy and Aquaculture (Amendment etc) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019. </p>
                  <p />
                  <p>Additionally, an identical amendment will allow the Secretary of State to make amendments to the (or create a new) North Western Waters discard plan (currently 2019/2239) for the whole of the UK with the consent of the DAs where necessary, again as per the similar changes made elsewhere.</p>
                  <p />
