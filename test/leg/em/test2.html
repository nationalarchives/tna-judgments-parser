                           (or Scottish or Welsh Ministers), whilst helpful, some Universal Credit claimants
                           will still find it very difficult to find the funds to pay their next set of childcare

                           to the childcare provider, made by the Secretary of State for upfront childcare costs,
                           where the claimant is taking up paid work or increasing their working hours. The funds
                           received as part of the Universal Credit award can then be set aside and used to help
                           pay the next set of childcare costs making it easier for the claimant to get into
                           the Universal Credit childcare costs payment cycle. </p>
