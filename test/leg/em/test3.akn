            <p>Under Section 51 (9) of the 2007 Act the Lord Chancellor must consult the Lord Chief Justice and the Judicial Appointments Commission before making an order under section 51(1). There has been statutory consultation, as required under Section 51 (9) of the 2007 Act, with the Lord Chief Justice and Judicial Appointments Commission. The Lord Chief Justice had no comments on the Order. The Judicial Appointments Commission had no comments on the Order. This consultation occurred between 21 March 2023 and 12 April 2023. A draft of the Order and of the Explanatory Memorandum were shared and discussed with officials in the Judicial Office and the Judicial Appointments Commission.</p>

          <content>
            <p>In March 2022 informal consultation took place on a broader proposal to extend judicial eligibility to all judicial offices in England and Wales with the Lord Chief Justice, the Judicial Appointments Commission, the Legal Services Board, the Bar Council, the Law Society and the Chartered Institute of Legal Executives. As a result of the views expressed, the Lord Chancellor decided to pursue a more limited approach to extending eligibility at this time, as per this Order. This will allow CILEX Fellows more opportunities to gain experience for senior judicial office by entering the judiciary through a wider range of offices than they currently are able to.</p>
