            <p>The purpose of this instrument is to provide for the Energy Bills Discount Scheme for Non-Standard Cases in Great Britain and Northern Ireland (“the Scheme”). The Scheme will provide support for the electricity and gas costs of eligible non-domestic customers of unlicensed gas and electricity supply, including businesses, charities, and public bodies such as schools and hospitals. Support will be provided in respect of energy consumed between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024. The Scheme is a grant scheme, delivering support through “scheme agreements” that incorporate published “Scheme Terms”. These regulations supplement those terms and support the operation and delivery of the Scheme.</p>

              <p>In most cases, customers, or those providing them with energy, will need to apply to participate in the Scheme. Those eligible for the additional support provided to organisations operating in energy and trade intensive industries (ETIIs), and heat networks with domestic customers, will also need to apply. However, the Scheme works by allowing claims to be made in respect of energy costs already incurred and the support will be backdated to 1st April 2023. </p>

              <p>The instruments do impose new duties on unlicensed energy suppliers. However, the department has engaged regularly with those likely to be affected and provided advanced notice of what they will be required to do in consequence of the instruments coming into force. The department therefore regards the coming into force date as reasonable, particularly in view of the imperative to provide support to non-domestic customers as soon as possible. </p>

            <p>This instrument forms part of the package of five SIs relating to the Energy Bills Discount Scheme (EBDS), replacing the Energy Bill Relief Scheme (EBRS) which ended on 31 March 2023. These instruments enable continued energy bill support to the non-domestic licensed and unlicensed gas and electricity supply markets and to non-domestic customers in Great Britain (GB) and Northern Ireland (NI) between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024.</p>

            <p>The suite of SIs includes The Energy Bills Discount Scheme Regulations 2023 and the Energy Bills Discount Scheme (Northern Ireland) 2023. These ensure that support (a scheme benefit) is passed from suppliers to their customers for non-domestic licensed gas and electricity supply in GB and NI.</p>

            <p>The EBDS (GB) and EBDS (NI) are made under sections 9 and 11 of the Energy Prices Act, which allow the Secretary of State to make provision for and in connection with reducing the amount that would otherwise be charged for licensed non-domestic electricity and gas supply, and for making payments to suppliers in respect of those reductions. Paragraphs 5 and 6 of Schedule 6 to the Act provide that those powers are time limited, in that they may only provide for the reduction in charges for energy supply for a total of two years (from 1 October 2022). Audit and compliance functions may continue beyond this date to ensure that public funds have been used appropriately. Instruments made under the Act may only apply to charges for energy consumed that take place during a period of six months or less (up to four such consecutive periods in total). EBDS takes us up to the end of the third of the four successive periods. Support under EBDS will be provided for a year (divided in two six-month periods), reflecting the limits in the Act.</p>

            <p>The Energy Bills Discount Scheme Pass-through Requirement Regulations 2023 and The Energy Bills Discount Scheme Pass-through Requirement (Heat Suppliers) Regulations 2023 ensures that support, i.e., a scheme benefit, is passed from intermediaries, with the latter focussing on intermediaries that are heat suppliers, to end users for non-domestic licensed gas and electricity supply in GB and NI. The EBDS (Heat Suppliers) Regulations 2023 modify. The Energy (Northern Ireland) Order 2003 (S.I. 2003/419 (N.I. 6)) to provide a complaints process for heat network customers in relation to the requirement on heat suppliers to pass on benefits received from EBRS for non-domestic customers in NI. The role of the General Consumer Council for NI will be similar to its complaints handling for gas and electricity customers.</p>

              <p>The Act addresses the negative social, economic and other impacts of the current unprecedentedly high energy prices and enables the delivery of EBRS and future iterations in GB and NI. EBRS was launched on 1 October 2022 as a temporary six-month measure to support non-domestic customers through the winter of 2022/2023. It provided relief (a scheme benefit) to eligible non-domestic customers (including businesses, the voluntary sector such as charities, and the public sector such as schools and hospitals). This relief (a discount for licensed suppliers’ customers, a grant for customers of unlicensed suppliers) was linked to the wholesale element of a customer’s gas and electricity bills.</p>

            <content>
              <p>The EBDS strikes a balance between supporting businesses between 1 April 2023 and 31 March 2024 and limiting taxpayers’ exposure to volatile energy markets. The EBDS will provide all eligible businesses and other non-domestic energy customers with a discount on high gas and electricity bills with its baseline scheme. It will also provide businesses in sectors with particularly high levels of energy use and trade intensity and domestic end users on heat networks with a higher level of support.  The baseline and ETII parts of the scheme were forecast by the OBR at Budget 2023 to be worth £0.5bn, with further support for Qualifying Heat Suppliers estimated at £0.4bn.</p>

              <p>Section 19 of the Energy Prices Act also enabled the Secretary of State to impose pass-through requirements on persons to whom energy price support was provided by regulations, or “intermediaries”. This ensured that end users who received and paid for their energy consumption via an intermediary, for example the tenant in a tenant and landlord relationship, would also receive a scheme benefit from EBDS.  </p>

              <p>Relevant intermediaries are any individual or organisation that is party to an electricity and/or gas contract and passes on the costs of the energy supplied under this contract to an end user of the energy supplied. This would also cover intermediaries supplying a product (or service) where contractually a component of the price relates directly to the use of energy. Intermediaries may include but are not limited to landlords, sublets, student accommodation managers, local authorities (for council housing), site owners (for park homes), marinas if using shore power (for boat homes), electric vehicle charging operators and other residential building managers.  </p>

            <content>
              <p>The regulations are important to ensure that end users of energy benefit from Scheme support and to set out the expectations on intermediaries and processes they should follow to ensure that this happens. These regulations also provide customers with a mechanism by which they can dispute what their intermediary has or has not done. Changes have been made to the regulations to allow the continuation of support under EBDS. These instruments ensure that the pass-through requirements on intermediaries are still applicable under EBDS. </p>

              <p>Heat networks may be EBDS Non-Standard Customers, but where this is the case, they will also be relevant intermediaries, as they purchase energy through commercial contracts and then use that energy to supply heating and hot water to domestic and non-domestic customers. The Heat Suppliers Regulations require heat networks that benefit from the higher heat network EBDS discount to pass on that benefit to their customers.</p>

              <p>The Energy Bill Relief Scheme Regulations 2022 and the Energy Bill Relief Scheme (Northern Ireland) Regulations 2022 provide for EBRS, which provided support between 1 October 2022 and 31 March 2023, to eligible non-domestic customers, who received their energy from licensed suppliers. Those regulations established who was eligible for the scheme and set out detailed requirements for suppliers to calculate and distribute scheme benefit (‘a discount’) to eligible non-domestic customers. They also set out rules that applied to different types of non-domestic customers and energy supply and provided powers for the Secretary of State to intervene as needed. These instruments also provide further detail on supplier reporting, auditing of suppliers and ensuring that obligations on licensed suppliers can be enforced. Government acted to protect British businesses from the spiralling costs of energy by implementing various energy support schemes.</p>

The legislation under EBRS sets out in further detail who is captured under the definition of a relevant intermediary, what must be taken into account in determining and calculating a just and reasonable amount and the obligations on the intermediary to provide this information to the end user. The legislation also sets out the dispute mechanism available to the end user if they wish to dispute what the intermediary has or has not done. The EBRS regulations set out that the relief should take into account (as appropriate) the end user’s usage and amount paid for their energy consumption as well as whether the intermediary itself is consuming and paying for its own energy or for common services provided.</p>

              <p>The differences between EBRS and EBDS account for the changes that have been from the EBRS to the EBDS NSC Regulations. This includes reflecting that the pass-through amount provided should be calculated in line with the end user’s contract type. For example, under EBDS, customers who are in Energy and Trade Intensive Industries (ETIIs) and heat network customers, are entitled to more support. It also includes provisions to ensure that where, under the schemes, the Secretary of State redetermines the amount a supplier is entitled to, the pass-through amount reflects this determination. It also amends the EBRS NSC Regulations to take account of the revised EBRS Scheme Terms published on 24th April 2023, which expand eligibility under EBRS to include the cohort of non-standard customers who receive their energy via wire or pipe. They will be able to apply retrospectively for support under EBRS for the period between 1 October 2022 and 31 March 2023.</p>

            <p>These instruments do not relate to withdrawal from the European Union nor trigger the statement requirements under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018. The GB Scheme does not engage Article 10 of the Windsor Framework (and provision is made to ensure that is the case). The ETII element of the Scheme as it applies in Northern Ireland engages Article 10 of the Windsor Framework (where the organisations participating in the Scheme trade in goods). Approval from the EU Commission was therefore sought under the Temporary Crisis and Transition Framework for State Aid measures to support the economy following the aggression against Ukraine by Russia. That Framework is due to remain in place until 31 December 2023. The Northern Ireland Regulations (under which ETII operators are certified for the purposes of the Scheme) makes provision to ensure that support is only provided if in accordance with Article 10 of the Windsor Framework.</p>

            <p>A HM Treasury-led Review of EBRS took place which determined support levels beyond March 2023. Government had made it clear that the levels of support under EBRS were time limited, and the discount level has been reduced. A Call for Evidence was undertaken between 17 November 2022 to 20 January 2023 in order to understand the situation of companies who were ineligible for EBRS support. Alongside the establishment of the Scheme, the Secretary of State is expanding the scope of EBRS for Non-Standard Cases. As a result, a group of customers that were not originally eligible for EBRS support (and will be eligible for EBDS support from the outset) will now be able to claim it retrospectively. In particular, this includes those who receive their energy via wire or pipe. The Call for Evidence, which received 17 responses, was used to inform the revised EBRS NSC policy. Informal consultations have taken place with energy suppliers, and some end users to test the methodology for applying the discount used in this instrument.</p>

          <content>
            <p>The impact of this instrument in itself on business, charities or voluntary bodies is minimal. It does not affect the energy price support to which customers are entitled or set out the requirements for obtaining support under the Scheme – all of which is governed by the Scheme Terms. In addition, the obligation on intermediaries to ensure that support they receive as intermediaries is passed on to the end users, and to provide information about pass-through to them involve minimal administrative costs for these bodies in ensuring fixed and variable charges, statements of accounts, rental charges and other forms of charging customers are adjusted to reflect the impact of EBDS. We consider that the benefits of customers receiving lower energy prices resulting from EBDS pass-through will significantly outweigh these administrative costs to intermediaries. For example, it will offer increased certainty for investment and employment decisions and thus avoid firm closures and redundancies. More detail on the benefits is provided in the accompanying Impact Assessment document. </p>

            <p>The impact on the public sector is deemed to be minimal. Some public sector bodies, such as local authorities, may be classed as intermediaries. Civil courts will be impacted if end users decide to claim pass-through of scheme benefits as civil debts from intermediaries.</p>

            <p>To minimise the impact of the requirements on small businesses (employing up to 50 people), the approach taken is to provide guidance to relevant intermediaries, including small businesses, to help them understand and implement the requirements under these instruments. Small businesses who are eligible for Energy and Trade Intensive Industry (ETII) support are required to register with the department. For Non-Standard Cases, the approach taken the energy provider will be invited to apply to the scheme on its customers’ behalf. The provider will apply for the correct amount of support to reflect e.g. customers’ ETII status, and pass on that support, once received from the department, to customers in one of the ways permitted under the Scheme Terms, which may include a discount or rebate. In exceptional circumstances where the energy provider has failed to make an application, the customer may apply directly to (and receive support directly from) the department as outlined in the Scheme Terms. All businesses are treated in the same way irrespective of size to reduce the administrative burden on small businesses. </p>

            <p>The basis for the final decision on what action to take to assist small businesses is to provide support under the Scheme (for eligible small businesses who receive their energy from unlicensed suppliers) that is comparable with the discounts they would receive under the Main Scheme Regulations if they were supplied by a licensed supplier. Micro-business that are on domestic tariffs will receive support through the Energy Price Guarantee scheme. Those on non-domestic tariffs that are supplied gas and electricity by a licensed supplier will receive support under EBDS. </p>
