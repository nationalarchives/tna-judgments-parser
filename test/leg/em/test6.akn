          <p>The above instrument formally discontinues the prison of Cornton Vale and was made by the Scottish Ministers in exercise of the power conferred upon them by section 37(1) of the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989. The instrument is subject to negative resolution procedure and comes into force on 6 June 2023. The discontinuance order is the formal legal act required to reflect that a prison has ceased to operate. </p>

          <p>HMP &amp; YOI Stirling has been built on part of the HMP &amp; YOI Cornton Vale site and is scheduled to open in May 2023, and it will become operational in June 2023. HMP &amp; YOI Cornton Vale closed to prisoners in March 2023 and all prisoners were relocated to other SPS sites. Although the prison will already be closed to prisoners by the time this Order comes into force, this Order means that this property can no longer be used as a prison.</p>
