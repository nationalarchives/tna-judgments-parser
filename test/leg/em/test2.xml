            <p>This instrument makes changes to the Universal Credit Regulations 2013<authorialNote marker="1"><p> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/376/contents"><u>https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2013/376/contents</u></a></p></authorialNote> (S.I. 2013/376). Under those regulations, a claimant can have an amount included in their Universal Credit award in respect of childcare costs if they meet the relevant entitlement conditions for that additional amount.</p>

            <p>Regulation 2 of The Universal Credit (Childcare) (Amendment) Regulations 2023 (this instrument) amends regulation 34 of the Universal Credit Regulations 2013. That regulation sets out how the amount in respect of childcare costs is calculated for the purposes of the Universal Credit award. The amendment provides for certain payments made by the Secretary of State (which have previously been left out of account) to be taken into account in determining the charges for childcare costs paid by the claimant. </p>

              <content>
                <p>The Universal Credit Regulations 2013, specifically the current provision in regulation 34, does not allow Universal Credit claimants to receive payment of the Universal Credit childcare element for any amount that is being met or reimbursed by an employer or some other person or is covered by “other relevant support”.</p>

              <content>
                <p>“Other relevant support” means payments out of funds provided by the Secretary of State or by Scottish or Welsh Ministers in connection with the claimant's participation in work-related activity or training.</p>

              <content>
                <p>The Secretary of State can make provision to assist claimants with upfront childcare costs and currently this is done via the Flexible Support Fund, a non-recoverable discretionary fund that Jobcentre staff can use to remove barriers claimants face when moving into work or progressing in work. Regulation 34, however, means that, when claimants receive funds for upfront childcare costs from the Secretary of State (or Scottish or Welsh Ministers), whilst helpful, some Universal Credit claimants will still find it very difficult to find the funds to pay their next set of childcare costs.</p>

              <content>
                <p>This instrument introduces a change that addresses this issue by allowing Universal Credit claimants, who are responsible for a child, to claim back up to 85% of a payment to the childcare provider, made by the Secretary of State for upfront childcare costs, where the claimant is taking up paid work or increasing their working hours. The funds received as part of the Universal Credit award can then be set aside and used to help pay the next set of childcare costs making it easier for the claimant to get into the Universal Credit childcare costs payment cycle. </p>

                <p>Currently the Universal Credit Regulations 2013 provides for the amount of Universal Credit in respect of childcare costs to be capped at £646.35 for one child or £1108.04 for two or more children, per assessment period.  These amounts have not changed, as a standalone measure, since 2006.</p>
