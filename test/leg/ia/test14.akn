                <p class="ia-table-text">BIS/EHRC research found that 77% of mothers had experienced at least one discriminatory/possibly discriminatory experience in work, and 11% of mothers felt forced to leave their job. A Women and Equalities Select Committee (WESC) inquiry concluded that there were unacceptable levels of discrimination in the workplace, including significant issues when mothers returned to work. One form this discrimination can take is employers making women redundant when they are pregnant, on maternity leave or when they return to work. </p>
                <p class="ia-table-text" />
                <p class="ia-table-text">Currently women on maternity leave have some additional limited protection from redundancy above other affected employees.  Their employer is required to offer them an alternative suitable role, not just invite them to apply (as for other affected employees).  </p>
                <p class="ia-table-text" />
                <p class="ia-table-text">However, the existing legislation is complex (with protections afforded by Equality Act 2010, the Employment Rights Act 1996 and MAPLE 1999).  And current provision does not offer any additional protection during pregnancy itself or the return to work period.  Government intervention is required to (i) simplify arrangements so they are better understood by employers and employees, and (ii) extend the protected period so pregnant women and those who have recently returned to work have safeguards against redundancy (as one possible form of discrimination) during these vulnerable periods.</p>

          <p>In 2016, BIS and EHRC commissioned research to investigate the prevalence and nature of maternity and pregnancy discrimination in the workplace. The research found that 77% mothers surveyed had experienced at least one discriminatory or possibly discriminatory experience at work, and 69% had experienced two or more such experiences. 11% of mothers surveyed felt forced to leave their job, either by being dismissed, made compulsorily redundant or because they were treated so poorly that they felt they had to leave. If we scale up this research to the general population this could mean up to 54,000 women a year. Discrimination against pregnant women and mothers was found to have increased since 2005, when similar research was conducted by the Equal Opportunities Commission.</p>

Only workplaces with at least 5 staff members were sampled.

          <p>The research highlighted inconsistencies between employers’ awareness of legal rights, their responsibilities and women’s experiences in the workplace. 70% of employers reported high levels of awareness of female employees’ rights, but when questioned further possible bias against pregnant women emerged. 70% of employers believed that women should declare their pregnancy during recruitment stage, and 25% of employers thought it was acceptable to ask a woman about their plans to have children during the recruitment process. Furthermore, half of mothers surveyed felt their pregnancy/maternity had negatively impacted their career. These findings raise the question of whether employers’ awareness of rights is sufficient to ensure non-discriminatory behaviour. It is unlawful for an employer to discriminate against a woman because of her pregnancy under the Equality Act 2010. If an employer does ask in an interview whether someone is pregnant or plans to have children, this is considered strong evidence that the employer is in breach of the laws against sex discrimination found in the Equality Act 2010.</p>

          <p>Employment law relating to pregnancy and maternity and redundancy is covered by the Equality Act 2010 and the Employment Rights Act 1996.The Equality Act sets out a ‘protected period’ during which women who are pregnant or have recently given birth are explicitly protected from discrimination. During the ‘protected period’ a woman is protected against discrimination that arises due to her pregnancy; any illness related to her pregnancy, or absence because of that illness; being on compulsory maternity leave; or seeking to take, taking or having taken ordinary or additional maternity leave.</p>

          <p>Regulation 10 of the Maternity and Parental Leave etc. Regulations 1999 (MAPLE) takes this protection a stage further for the period of maternity leave. It states that if it is not practicable by reason of redundancy for an employer to continue to employ a woman on maternity leave, the employee is entitled to be offered (not just invited to apply for) a suitable available vacancy with her employer (or an associated employer). This gives the woman priority over other employees who are at risk of redundancy, even if the other employees are better qualified for the job. This protection applies <u>only</u> whilst the woman is on maternity leave.</p>

          <p>In response to the findings of the BIS/EHRC research, the Women and Equalities Select Committee (WESC) launched an inquiry into pregnancy and maternity discrimination. The inquiry built on the existing evidence base, drawing on evidence presented by a large range of stakeholders including Maternity Action, Citizens Advice, and Unite<authorialNote marker="4"><p> WESC (2016), Report: Pregnancy and Maternity Discrimination at <u>https://publications.parli ament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmselect/cmwomeq/90/90.pdf</u> </p></authorialNote>. Maternity Action reported there had been a “significant increase in rates of pregnancy discrimination in the past decade” based on increases seen between the 2005 survey and 2014/15 and their experience of offering advice to pregnant women and mothers. Maternity Action found in 2005, 30,000 women lost their jobs as a result of pregnancy discrimination. Their findings in 2015 showed that 54,000 women lost their jobs (either dismissed; made compulsorily redundant, where others in their workplace were not; or treated so poorly they felt they had to leave their job) as a result of pregnancy discrimination. Citizens Advice provided figures<authorialNote marker="5"><p> In total, Citizens Advice helped 6,358 people in 2014/15 with, this number rising to 6,725 in 2015/16 on specific maternity rights and pregnancy discrimination issues. For pregnancy discrimination figures, the number of people it helped rose from 1,551 in 2014/15 to 1,923 in 2015/16. Similarly, the number of people it helped with maternity rights (maternity leave, contractual maternity pay, other maternity rights and redundancy during maternity leave) rose from 5,256 in 2014/15 to 5,324 in 2016/17.</p></authorialNote> that showed the number of people it helped with specific maternity rights and discrimination issues increased between 2014/15 and 2016/17 and that there was a wider unmet need for advice and support to women experiencing pregnancy and maternity discrimination. WESC concluded that there were unacceptable levels of discrimination and significant issues around a new mother’s return to work. Employers frequently put mothers at risk of redundancy on their first day back from maternity leave, according to Your Employment Settlement Service Law<authorialNote marker="6"><p> WESC (2016), Report: Pregnancy and Maternity Discrimination. </p></authorialNote>.  WESC recommend extending redundancy protection to apply throughout pregnancy, maternity leave and for six months afterwards. </p>

          <p>The Taylor Review of modern employment practices recommended consolidating the legislation and guidance for protections against pregnancy and maternity discrimination.

          <p>Given the recommendations to consolidate legislation, the Government has considered how best to achieve a consistent approach in extending redundancy protection. The Government published a consultation on extending redundancy protection pregnant women and new parents, which questioned whether similar protections should be given to parents returning from adoption and shared parental leave, as these groups take extended periods of leave for similar purposes. These parents may also experience discrimination and redundancy based on their absence from work for childcare and should not remain disadvantaged.</p>

          <p>WESC also highlighted the need for greater enforcement of measures to prevent maternity and pregnancy discrimination during redundancy, raising the concern that currently the burden of enforcement predominantly rests with women. Those making a discrimination claim at Tribunal must demonstrate unfavourable treatment, and the burden to provide evidence is on the individual. Under MAPLE regulations, the requirement is on the employer to demonstrate that no suitable alternative job is available. Providing greater consistency of protection during maternity/adoption/shared parental leave and into a period of return to work, would help reduce the burden on parents seeking to make a claim at tribunal.</p>

          <p>In addition to the legislative proposal, the Government has also pursued non-statutory approaches to tackle maternity discrimination. Government has worked with bodies such as Acas and EHRC to ensure that pregnant employees and new mothers have the information they need to challenge unacceptable or bad practice. We have updated and consolidated guidance on the GOV.UK website and have taken steps to signpost that advice and guidance at appropriate stages using other interactions with pregnant women and new mothers – such as through DWP’s MAT B1 form and the NHS’s Start for Life programme.  </p>

          <p>The 2019 consultation achieved over 640 responses, with almost 540 seeking an extension to the time limits to tribunal cases which are treated separately to the main consultation questions. Of the 105 responses directly related to the consultation document, 78% were from individuals, 11% from employers, 2% from Trade Unions and 3% from industry/employer groups. The responses also achieved variation in terms of sector represented, with 47% in the private sector, 27% in the public sector and 11% in the charity sector (the remainder did not specify). In addition, BEIS ran a number of roundtable and workshop discussions with both employers and individuals.</p>

          <p>However, a non-statutory approach cannot address the specific issue with unevenness in redundancy protections afforded to pregnant women and new parents. The consultation also indicated that 26% of respondents felt the steps were “not very or not at all effective” in informing pregnant women and new mothers of their employment rights (further 31% didn’t know) and there was a similar picture reported to the question on whether the steps had been effective in informing employers of their obligations.</p>

          <p>The Government responded to this consultation in July 2019. In the response, government highlighted that over three quarters of respondents to the consultation agreed that the redundancy protection currently provided when someone is on maternity leave should be extended into a period of return to work. Responses were also generally positive on the benefits for both individuals and employers. Nearly three quarters of respondents felt that six months was appropriate. When answering the question about when redundancy protection should start, over two thirds of respondents agreed that this should be from the point when an employee informs their employer. Consultation responses were clearly in favour (over 80%) of providing similar redundancy protections to other groups returning to work having taken extended periods of leave for similar purposes to maternity leave. Adoption leave and Shared Parental Leave were considered most similar to maternity leave.</p>

Limited information exists on how effective similar proposals have been in other countries, making it difficult to argue there is a specific amount of time for which the protection should last. However, the consultation found that three months would simply delay the point at which an employer sought to make a new mother redundant and twelve months was thought too long a period for these purposes and would represent an unjustified burden on businesses seeking to deploy their staff most effectively. </p>

          <p>Unlawful pregnancy and maternity discrimination remains prevalent in the workplace, as evidenced by the BIS/EHRC research and WESC inquiry. Under the current legislation (MAPLE), new mothers on maternity leave are protected from redundancy and are entitled to be offered (not just invited to apply for) a suitable available vacancy with her employer (or an associated employer) if at risk of redundancy. This offers protection to address one form of discrimination, but it currently applies only whilst the woman is on maternity leave.</p>

Employers are currently not incentivised to provide sufficient employment protection for pregnant and new parents and are likely to prioritise their costs and bottom line. </p>

          <p>There is an unacceptable number of pregnant women and mothers each year that are estimated to be affected by redundancy discrimination. The 2016 BIS and EHRC research estimated that 1% of all mothers report being made redundant whilst pregnant and 2% on return from maternity leave.  We estimate that this means each year there are roughly 2,500 pregnant employees, 5,000 new mothers, and a small number of new adoptive parents and partners on return from Shared Parental Leave who are made redundant (with no alternative or lower position offered)<authorialNote marker="9"><p> See paragraph<b> </b>57 for further details on how this has been calculated.</p></authorialNote>. While it is difficult to directly compare redundancy rates (and discrimination) with other groups in the labour market (as data is limited regarding redundancy outcomes) there are strong equity reasons for protecting this group. For example, we know that pregnant women and new parents face challenges in balancing work with pregnancy and family life more generally. Parents may need to reduce hours of work (or other forms of flexible working), take on less responsibility or<b> </b>take more leave to deal with appointments and childcare etc. Crucially, there is clear evidence that the employment participation and pay gap for women begin to open up around the age of childbearing and never close (sometimes referred to as the ‘motherhood penalty’) – this relationship has been shown to be causal<authorialNote marker="10"><p> Blundell, R., Dias, M.

Direct comparisons with earlier surveys (2006 or 2009) are not possible due to methodological changes, but the latest survey findings suggest the experience of unfair treatment has not decreased.

The percentage of employees in small and micro businesses (businesses with up to 50 employees) was estimated to be 28.5%, 14.1% of employees were estimated to work in medium businesses (with 50-249 employees), and 57.5% of employees were estimated to work in large businesses. We now have data from the Parental Rights Survey, which is specific to parents, which estimates that 39% of mothers work in small businesses (fewer than 50 staff), 18% work in medium size businesses (50-249 employees) and 37% work in large employers (250+ employees). Given this data indicates a significant proportion of target population work in both small and medium businesses, the policy response must apply to firms of all sizes or it will be inadequate in addressing unlawful behaviour and discrimination across the labour market.</p>

          <p>By strengthening the legislative framework around redundancies during pregnancy and for returning parents, these groups will face less discrimination, both directly and indirectly e.g. given existing protections around pregnancy, it is currently very rare for women to be dismissed solely because they are pregnant, as this is clearly unlawful. Employers may however make pregnant women redundant instead. This legislative change will reduce the number of these cases.

          <p>Tackling discrimination against pregnant women and returning mothers in the workplace addresses wider Government objectives of improving female career progression, and reducing the gender pay gap. Policy proposals to help women remain in the labour market may address large gender wage differentials in senior positions. IFS research<authorialNote marker="14"><p> Costa Dias, M., Joyce, R., Parodi, F. (2018), Wage progression and the gender wage gap: the causal impact of hours of work, Institute for Fiscal Studies. </p></authorialNote> found that the gender pay gap is relatively small on entry into the labour market, but widens when the first child arrives and by the time this child is 20 there is a 30% difference in average hourly wages between men and women. The IFS find that a key factor behind the differential is that mothers accumulate less work experience (and work experience is associated with wage growth) than fathers due to less time spent in work. Policies to help keep mothers in employment following the birth of their child may help to address divergences in the accumulation of work experience. </p>

          <p>There is a clear preference for this option.

            <p>Whilst Maternity and Adoption Leave are taken as a single block, SPL is designed to give parents flexibility. It can be taken in multiple blocks, for varying lengths of time, throughout the first year of a child’s life. Providing redundancy protection to partners returning from SPL is, therefore, more complicated than for adoptive parents and mothers. Giving an SPL parent 6 months redundancy protection following one week of SPL, say, would not be in the spirit of the policy. We propose a blanket 18-month period from child’s birth of redundancy protection for parents.  We are undertaking further consultations on the purpose of, need for and length of a qualifying period of relevant leave to ensure that the ensuing regulations provide appropriate protection.</p>

          <p>The protection period will start as soon as you tell your employer that you are pregnant. The protection continues to apply for the entire period of maternity leave as is currently the case through MAPLE 1999 – which can be up to 12 months. We plan to extend this further, for a period of 6 months of return to work. This means a total duration of up to 27 months. Given women are currently protected during Maternity Leave, the additional period of protection will be 15 months (9 months during pregnancy and then 6 months on return following Maternity Leave).</p>

          <p>Having considered multiple options on the length of protection, a blanket 18-month period following the child’s birth is considered sufficient time for new parents to re-establish themselves in the workplace and demonstrate their value to the employer. There is limited evidence on the effectiveness of similar proposals in other countries, but in Germany the redundancy protection period is 4 months. WESC recommended a protection period of 6 months. A blanket 18-month period of protection will ensure that most new parents are protected for at least 6 months. The average duration of Maternity Leave is estimated at 9 months, based on evidence from the Maternity and Paternity Rights Survey (2008), and the maximum duration is 12 months. </p>

          <p>We have cautiously assumed that, following the implementation of the policy, the percentage of businesses offering alternative positions at a lower level (73%) will remain the same as estimated in the 2016 research as we cannot directly calculate firms’ behavioural response. Firms may respond to the policy by ensuring they offer pregnant women/new parents suitable alternative positions (at the same or higher level). However, under MAPLE, it is already unlawful to not do this – those on maternity leave who are made redundant are entitled to be offered a suitable alternative vacancy. There is also little evidence available on how the improved advice and guidance may have improved employer behaviour in the meantime, so the 73% assumption remains the best available evidence and can be viewed as capturing the upper range of costs<authorialNote marker="26"><p> We have performed sensitivity analysis on this assumption and found that a change of 1p.p to 72% decreases recurring business costs by around £1.3m per annum.</p></authorialNote>.</p>

          <p>Following introduction of the policy, some employers may incur administrative costs from collecting evidence for a redundancy decision. These costs have not been estimated as we assume that in the counterfactual scenario businesses already collect such evidence. In the case of women facing maternity discrimination, under the Equality Act 2010 it is unlawful to treat women less favourably due to their maternity. In this case, redundancy may amount to unfair dismissal. Employers must follow a fair redundancy process, and good practice involves using objective criteria to select employees at risk of redundancy, or firms risk appeals against unfair dismissal and the potential of Employment Tribunal cases. This process would involve collecting evidence to justify the redundancy decision. Unfair selection criteria include pregnancy, maternity, paternity and parental leave and thus the same reasoning applies for pregnant women (who have even stronger protections under MAPLE), and for adoptive parents and parents who take SPL (who have similar protections under the Equality Act 2010).</p>

          <p>Under the current system, employers could still be justified in making pregnant women/returning mothers redundant for reasons unrelated to pregnancy and where it can be demonstrated that no suitable alternative position exists, e.g. where businesses faced the threat of bankruptcy and closure. Since this would still follow under the proposed policy, we attempt to carve out these cases, using data from European Restructuring Monitor (ERM)<authorialNote marker="27"><p> <a href="https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/emcc/erm/restructuring-statistics?field_value_group_by=restructuring_type&amp;field_value_country=9520&amp;field_value_sector=All&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;edit-submit=Apply"><u>https://www.eurofound.europa.eu/observatories/emcc/erm/restructuring-statistics?field_value_group_by=restructuring_type&amp;field_value_country=9520&amp;field_value_sector=All&amp;date_from=&amp;date_to=&amp;edit-submit=Apply</u></a> </p></authorialNote>, which provides information on the large restructuring events reported in national media across EU member states. The data shows that 31% of job losses can be attributed to bankruptcy/closure, offshoring or relocation<authorialNote marker="28"><p> Stripping out these cases leaves us with 69% cases (100% - 31%). We carve out these cases to avoid including cases where the employer could be justified in making redundancies for reasons unrelated to pregnancy and thus avoid overestimating the target population. </p></authorialNote>. We deduct the percentage of cases from the entire target population to arrive at a final figure below. One limitation with the data source is that the monitor almost exclusively reports on restructuring in medium and larger size firms. Whilst we do not have information for small firms, we would imagine that the percentage of jobs lost to bankruptcy or closure in these firms would likely to be higher, since small firms tend to have less complex organisational structures and are likely to incur job losses for more conventional reasons. The database has covered restructuring events since 2002 so is unlikely to be adversely impacted by the economic downturns. Moreover, the overall percentage of employees made redundant for legitimate reasons across all businesses could be higher, as there may be other legitimate reasons other than bankruptcy/closure, offshoring or relocation for redundancy.</p>

We then estimate the number of SPL partners in workplaces with more than 1 employee at 11,300 using the same approach as above. The proportion of SPL partners made redundant on return from SPL is assumed to be 2%; the same percentage used for mothers, in absence of further evidence. Applying this percentage to the figure of 11,300 gives the number of SPL partners made redundant on return from SPL, including voluntary redundancies (230). The share of SPL partners made redundant where no alternative or lower level position was offered is assumed to be 73%, as for mothers, in absence of further evidence. Multiplying 230 by this percentage gives a final estimate for the number of SPL partners who would be protected from redundancy on return from SPL, excluding voluntary redundancies (100). </p>

To qualify for adoption leave, an individual must be an employee. One parent is entitled to take adoption leave, and it is possible for the other parent to take SPL. For simplicity, we assume that a mother will take adoption leave and a father/partner will take SPL. This is based on evidence (HMRC Statutory Payments data) where females predominantly (75%) make up those in receipt of Statutory Adoption Pay. The take-up of adoption leave is conservatively assumed to be 100%, in absence of further evidence. To estimate the number of adoptive parents in employment, therefore, we multiply the female (with dependent child under 1) employment rate (77.5%) by the total number of adoptions each year resulting in an estimate of 2,700. We then carve out the self-employed and workplaces with only 1 employee to estimate the number of adoptive parents in workplaces with more than 1 employee at 2,500. The same assumptions are applied as mothers returning from maternity leave on the proportion of mothers made redundant on return from maternity leave and the proportion of mothers made redundant where no alternative/lower level position was offered. This gives an estimate of the number of adoptive parents made redundant on return from adoption leave, excluding voluntary redundancies. This number and break downs of the calculations are suppressed due to the size of the numbers.</p>

          <p>There are potentially multiple costs and benefits associated with this policy change. We have monetised the costs and benefits which are the most significant and directly linked to the policy. We also consider some 2nd and 3rd round impacts, these are discussed in the annexes. Monetised costs are divided into one-off (familiarisation) costs for businesses, and recurring costs to businesses, individuals and the Exchequer.</p>

          <p>Due to the policy, businesses will have to spend more time familiarising themselves with the new legislation. Businesses will already be broadly familiar with the policy as this legislation is an extension to existing legislation. Familiarisation with the legislation is assumed to consist of reading and understanding the legislation and informing staff within the organisation. We do not expect firms to provide additional formal training on this legislation, as the legislation only extends existing redundancy protection to new groups of employees. The full costs of familiarisation for redundancy protection under MAPLE were captured when the original policy was introduced.</p>

          <p>Through consultation we have tested our assumptions around familiarisation, including through discussions with the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD). We are unable to specifically evidence our assumptions with a published data source but are reassured that the pregnancy and maternity discrimination laws do not create significant familiarisation burdens on employers. Around 61% of private sector employers stated that these laws are “well drafted” and “easy to apply” in a 2016 CIPD survey on employment law burdens.  </p>

          <p>In large businesses, an HR Manager or Director is likely to be responsible for familiarisation. Using data from the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings 2021<authorialNote marker="35"><p> https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasEmployment Tribunal/occupation4digitsoc2010ashetable14</p></authorialNote> (ASHE), the mean hourly wage rate is £26.52 per hour. Applying an uprating of 21.8% to include non-wage labour costs results in a total rate of £32.30 per hour. In addition, in large firms we assume that 3 HR administrative assistants on £12.50 per hour will familiarise themselves with the legislation. After accounting for non-wage costs, the total rate is estimated at £15.22 for each assistant. For small firms, we assume the Managing Director/Owner will be responsible for familiarisation. The average wage of Managers/Directors/Senior official is £26.60 (rising to £32.40 after adjusting for non-wage costs). The table below shows the approach taken for estimating familiarisation costs.</p>

          <p>Firms who otherwise would have made a pregnant woman redundant will now contribute to Statutory Maternity Pay (SMP). This entitlement is equivalent to 90% of salary for the first six weeks of maternity leave, and £156.66 per week for the subsequent 33 weeks. Employers administer statutory pay on behalf of Government and small employers can recover 103% of statutory payments that they make to their employees from HMRC. This represents a benefit to small businesses of 3% of their Statutory Maternity Pay. Larger employers (defined as those with a National Insurance contributions bill of £45,000 or more) can recover 92% of Statutory Maternity Pay made to their employees, thus large employers face a cost of 8% of their Statutory Maternity Pay. Using Business Population Estimates we calculate an average contribution of 5.8% to Statutory Maternity Pay from employers.</p>

          <p>To qualify for Statutory Maternity Pay, employees must have worked continuously for the same employer for at least 26 weeks and earned on average £120 per week. Analysis of LFS micro data shows that 95.7% of female employees with a dependent child under 1 have worked for the same employer continuously for at least six months. For the earnings requirement we use ASHE 2021 data to estimate the percentage of female employees who earn at least £120 per week at 92%.</p>

          <p>We expect some savings associated with a reduction in the number of individuals seeking to enforce their rights through Employment Tribunal and Early Conciliation. The extension to the protected period will mean fewer pregnant women and returning parents will be made redundant. This avoids a source of potential employee-employer conflict, which may centre on the issue of fairness or on whether the correct process was followed. The sections below sets out the business, employee and exchequer benefits from this change. We have assumed that the protection period of 6 months on return to work gives parents sufficient time to re-establish themselves in work and will mean employers will not simply delay any redundancy decisions to a later point. </p>

          <p>The employer savings from a reduction in employment tribunal (ET) cases arise from the Director and senior staff time spent, HR time spent and the median paid costs for advice and representation. Based on the Survey of Employment Tribunal Applications (SETA) 2018, Directors spend 6.25 days on a case and HR staff spend 0.5 days on a case. Assuming 8 working hours in a day, we use ASHE 2021 median hourly wages (adjusted for non-wage costs) for Chief Executives, senior officials, HR managers and directors respectively to estimate the unit cost of time spent by Directors and senior staff and HR on an ET case. Combined with the median paid costs for advice and representation (£3,400, also SETA 2018), we estimate the unit employer cost of defending an ET case at £5,400. </p>

          <p>It is difficult to predict the business response to legislative change, and it is possible that changes will lead to redundancies elsewhere in the business (see Annex A for discussion on scenarios). In the absence of supporting evidence, we apply a factor of 50% to the eligible population to account for this uncertainty for our best estimate. We apply a factor of 0% and 100% respectively for low and high scenarios.

          <p>Following a similar strategy used to estimate these benefits for businesses above we attempt to calculate savings for individuals who no longer go to tribunal or early conciliation. The costs of a claimant going to ET arise from time spent on the case, costs of advice and representation, and travel and communication costs. Based on SETA 2018 evidence, claimants are assumed to spend 7.5 days on a case and 8 working hours per day. Applying the median hourly pay (£14.05) from ASHE 2021, we estimate an individual spends £840 per case. The median paid cost of advice and representation for a claimant is estimated to be £1,400, and an additional £28 for communication and travel costs (SETA 2018). In total, the unit individual cost of an ET hearing for claimants is therefore estimated at almost £2,300.</p>

We calculate the difference to derive the net benefit of Statutory Maternity Pay compared to Maternity Allowance to mothers.

          <p>As outlined above, for pregnant women no longer made redundant, we assumed that this entire group would have MA, which is less generous than SMP. These are both Exchequer costs (for SMP employers can reclaim the costs from Government). Under the proposed option, these women who are protected under the enhanced redundancy protection will no longer claim MA and instead be entitled to SMP. Therefore, we include the savings to the Exchequer from no longer incurring the costs associated with MA (the costs incurred from Statutory Maternity Pay are calculated separately).</p>

        <intro>
          <p>Economic theory suggests that when a business makes someone redundant, they do so because the costs of employing them outweigh the benefits. This means that businesses will incur labour costs from retaining pregnant women and/or employees returning from Maternity/Shared Parental/Adoption Leave, who would, in the absence of legislation be made redundant. However, it is difficult to reliably quantify this impact, particularly in marginal redundancy decisions, as it requires a number of theoretical assumptions which go well beyond the available evidence. For example, the following theoretical assumptions have to be considered: </p>

We have not attempted to estimate this benefit but arguably there is output value which mean the net impacts will be negative but close to zero in marginal redundancy cases.</p>

          <p>The analysis does not account for contractual Maternity Pay (termed Occupational Maternity Pay) or contractual Redundancy Pay i.e. where an employer has access to a policy which is more generous than the statutory scheme (an employer may change this policy and apply specific terms and conditions on access to these schemes). In some circumstances an employee may now benefit from a more generous maternity pay package (and the employer would face the associated costs for this) if they would otherwise be made redundant. Similarly, employees may miss out on more generous redundancy pay (and the employer would benefit from no longer having to pay them) as they are no longer selected for redundancy. As such schemes are discretionary and a matter of contractual law, they are outside the scope of this Impact Assessment.  </p>

            <p>Some employers and individuals saw this as a short-term cost which would be mitigated by the later benefits of greater retention and more productive workforce.

            <p>Smaller employers will have less discretion in choosing alternative staff for redundancy and retaining other workers which could have an associated cost. However, to meet the policy objective of tackling discrimination in the workplace against pregnant women and new parents, the redundancy protections must apply to all firms irrespective of size. Allowing small businesses to opt out of the policy would undermine the policy objectives, as it would signal that Government condones discrimination against pregnant women and new parents in small firms.</p>

          <p>Small and micro firms will face familiarisation costs, as summarised on page 17, but we estimate that small and micro businesses will spend less time on familiarisation than larger firms as they have fewer managers/employees to inform and are able to quickly filter information throughout the organisation.

          <p>The proposal is designed to have a positive impact on pregnant women and returning parents and therefore will benefit female and male employees falling into these groups. The policy covers those returning from Maternity, Adoption and Shared Parental Leave and therefore provides protection to fathers/partners and individuals in same sex relationships. We do not expect that stronger protections for pregnant women/returning parents to have a disproportionate effect on other groups. However, there may be some small negative impacts on other groups (i.e. those that are made redundant instead of returning parents in the ‘substitution’ scenario) or other workers if an employer attempts to deal with cost pressures by reducing worker benefits more generally (i.e. in the cost-offset scenario). The policy is unlikely to create barriers to equality in relation to an employee’s religion and belief, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, disability and race and their marriage/civil partnership status. </p>

            <p>Under scenario 1, in the counterfactual the employer would have made another employee redundant. This assumes that the protected individual has comparable value and skills to the other employee. This assumption will not hold for all firms, but a proportion of firms will fall under scenario 1. This assumption is more likely to hold for large employers, as they have a larger pool of candidates to select from. In these instances, the employer will be incentivised to find someone similarly skilled to the protected individual in order to minimise costs to the business. </p>

          <p>A small employer will have less discretion in choosing alternative staff for redundancy, so fewer small firms are likely to fall under scenario 1. If there are significant differences in skills, the employer may respond by not making another individual redundant. This behaviour is consistent with scenario 2.</p>

          <p>To evidence our assumptions on firms’ behavioural responses we draw on data from the Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS)<authorialNote marker="50"><p>http://nesstar.ukdataservice.ac.uk/webview/index.jsp?v=2&amp;mode=documentation&amp;submode=abstract&amp;study=http://nesstar.ukdataservice.ac.uk:80/obj/fStudy/7226&amp;top=yes</p></authorialNote>.  For those employers who had to make redundancies in the last 12 months, workplace managers were asked the main reason for redundancy. The table below provides the main reason for redundancy for the last two waves of WERS.</p>

          <p>The WERS data suggests that firms face several different contexts which could lead to redundancy and occur over different timeframes. Some are short-term redundancies due to a lack of demand or financial constraints. Others relate to strategic decisions, for example, re-structuring. </p>

          <p>We assume that firms under scenario 1 make redundancies due to short term pressures, and so would make another individual redundant. We estimate the proportion of these businesses by defining short-term reasons as: lack of demand for products/services, improved competitiveness/efficiency/cost reduction, and reductions in budget/cash limits. Using 2011 data, 55% of firms cite short-term redundancy reasons.</p>

          <p>The 2011 survey results may have been affected by the 2008 financial crisis, after which redundancies were made across the economy. A larger percentage of firms may have cited lack of demand as a main reason for redundancies than those would in the current environment. To avoid over estimating the percentage of firms following scenario 1, we consider the 2004 data, where 44% of firms cite short-term factors. For the central scenario we take the approximate midpoint and assume 50% of firms will follow scenario 1. The remaining 50% of firms fall under scenario 2. </p>

        <content>
          <p>The percentage of firms citing short-term reasons for redundancy may be larger, as these reasons are likely to be cited by the smallest firms with fewer than 5 employees. These firms are not covered by WERS. The WERS survey results are based on a stratified random sample from the Inter Departmental Business Register (IDBR), with the overall sample being representative of workplaces with at least 5 employees. Small firms are more vulnerable to scenarios such as lack of demand for products/services, for example, and are likely to respond with redundancies. The current sensitivity modelling may, therefore, be conservative in estimating the impacts on businesses.</p>

Any disincentives at recruitment stage are likely to exist for all women of child-bearing age. In addition, under the policy proposal, the protected parent will notify their employer during pregnancy, not at recruitment stage.</p>

Under MAPLE, parents are already protected against redundancy whilst on Maternity/Adoption/Shared Parental Leave. To calculate the additional labour cost to business of the policy, we estimate the labour costs across the remaining protection period. The length of additional protection for parents returning from maternity and adoption leave is 9 months, based on 9 months as the average duration of leave taken. The length of additional protection for SPL partners is 15.7 months, based on 10 weeks as the average duration of SPL taken (see paragraph 160). We assume that employers previously would have made returning parents redundant upon their return to work.</p>

          <p>For pregnant mothers, we assume they were made redundant after they formally tell their employer in writing they are pregnant (typically 20 weeks before the due date). Therefore, after the policy is implemented this results in an additional 20 weeks of labour costs for affected employers.</p>

          <p>We estimate the labour costs to business as the costs of paying eligible returning parents’ wages across the redundancy protection period. We calculate a weighted median weekly wage for women and men using ASHE 2021 data and weight this by the age of mothers and fathers for live births across Great Britain in 2019/20, yielding an estimate of £424.21 for the weekly wage costs for women, and £437.50 for men. This approach is shown in Table 10 for female wages. An adjustment factor<authorialNote marker="51"><p> Non -wage costs (20.6% ) Eurostat, April 2018</p></authorialNote> is also applied to reflect non-wage costs incurred by business. Wage costs are taken from ASHE 2021 provisional data<authorialNote marker="52"><p> <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/agegroupashetable6"><u>https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/earningsandworkinghours/datasets/agegroupashetable6</u></a> </p></authorialNote>.

For new mothers and adoptive parents returning to work, we follow a similar approach but only estimate labour costs for nine months of protection after they return from maternity/adoption leave. For partners returning from SPL, we estimate the labour costs for 15.7 months of redundancy protection. Wages are uplifted to account for the time away from work. Following the approach set out in Table 10 for each group of parents, we <b><i>estimate illustrative labour costs to employers of keeping mother employed at £89.5m per year. In our low-cost estimate (where all business fall under Scenario 1), businesses do not incur any labour costs and in our high cost estimate (where all businesses fall under Scenario 2) labour costs are £178.9m per year.</i></b></p>

          <p>Savings from not paying Statutory Redundancy Pay are discussed here as illustrative impacts but are not captured in the main economic assessment as it remains unclear whether the employee will be made redundant after the end of the protection period.

          <p>Under scenario 2, following the introduction of the policy, businesses will benefit from no longer paying Statutory Redundancy Pay to pregnant women and parents returning to work. Under scenario 1, those businesses who would have made someone else redundant still face these payments and thus will not experience these savings.</p>

          <p>Since these benefits only materialise in scenario 2, we apply a factor of 50% to the population eligible for Statutory Redundancy Pay for our best estimate. Statutory Redundancy Pay depends on length of service and the age of the employee during service. Employees are also required to have worked for at least two years with their current employer to receive the entitlement. </p>

          <p>The approach to calculating Statutory Redundancy Pay is cautiously an upper bound estimate as it is based on simple averages whereas, in practice, the calculation of Statutory Redundancy Pay will account for the number of years’ service at each age band and capped amounts relating to length of service, weekly and total pay amounts.</p>

        <paragraph>
          <content>
            <p>As discussed in the non-monetised costs and benefits section, there will be some output benefit associated with retaining pregnant women and/or employees returning from Maternity/Shared Parental/Adoption Leave, who would, in the absence of legislation be made redundant. However we assume that the benefit to the business of keeping someone employed, who would otherwise be made redundant, is less than the cost of employing them. We have not attempted to estimate this benefit as it requires a number of theoretical assumptions which go well beyond the available evidence, but arguably there is output value which mean the net impacts will be negative but close to zero in marginal redundancy cases.</p>

          <p>Extending the MAPLE protections into the return to work period means pregnant mothers will benefit from continuing to receive a salary before going on leave and during the redundancy protection period. Parents returning from Maternity Leave, Adoption Leave and Shared Parental Leave will also benefit from continuing to receive a salary during the redundancy protection period. The salary payments represent a direct transfer from businesses to individuals. We do not include a wage uplift in calculating the salary benefits, as non-wage costs are incurred by employers.</p>

          <p>The policy involves an 18-month window of redundancy protection for eligible parents, but under MAPLE parents are already protected against redundancy whilst on maternity/adoption/shared parental leave. To estimate the additional salary benefit over the remaining protection period, we estimate the duration of maternity, adoption and shared parental leave taken. We estimate the length of maternity and adoption leave taken at 9 months, based on evidence from the Parental Rights Survey (2018) on the average number of weeks of maternity leave taken. We estimate the length of SPL taken at 10 weeks, based on MWPS evidence on the average duration of SPL taken by men.</p>

          <p>For pregnant women now protected from redundancy the salary benefits are calculated for the 20 weeks before they go on maternity leave and the nine months upon return to work.

The median weekly earnings for males and females aged over 16, excluding overtime, are applied to the relevant eligible populations to estimate the total salary benefits.</p>

We calculate a weighted median weekly wage for women and men, weighted by the age of mothers and fathers for live births across Great Britain in 2019/20. The earnings estimates are used to estimate the individual benefits of wages over the redundancy protection period. Wages are uplifted to adjust for non-wage costs incurred by businesses, based on Eurostat data.</p>
