                <p class="ia-table-text">Criminal activity can be enabled and perpetuated by organisations. The limited ability to hold organisations criminally responsible for fraud in recent years has raised concern that parts of the law that hold organisations liable are not fit for purpose.  Following a review by the Law Commission, the government has decided to legislate to ensure there can be successful prosecution of organisations for economic crime, particularly fraud. </p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">The strategic objective is to reduce fraud. The failure to prevent fraud (FTPF) offence should encourage organisations to build an anti-fraud culture, in the same way that the failure to prevent bribery offence (introduced in 2010) has driven change in corporate culture. The government expects a reduction in fraud committed by people within organisations.</p>

The limited ability to hold organisations criminally responsible for fraud has raised concern that parts of corporate criminal liability law are not fit for purpose. This has created challenges in the successful prosecution of organisations for crime, particularly economic crimes.</p>

          <p>Under the law, an incorporated organisation or partnership is considered to have a distinct legal entity from its owners or officers and is considered a separate “legal person” in itself. As such, these organisations can be subject to criminal and civil liability. In the year to September 2020, there were over 5,000 convictions of non-natural persons, representing around 0.6 per cent of all convictions<authorialNote marker="4"><p> <a href="https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/corporate-criminal-liability/"><u>https://www.lawcom.gov.uk/project/corporate-criminal-liability/</u></a>  page 1 - Ministry of Justice, Criminal Justice system statistics quarterly, September 2020, Table Q5.1. The need for cautioned arises because, according to the Ministry of Justice, ambiguity in the status of small business owners can lead to individual defendants being recorded as corporations, and, by implication, vice versa (for instance, some corporations were recorded as having received sentences only available to natural persons, such as community or custodial sentences. Figures up to September 2020, as opposed to more recent figures, have been used because of the disruption caused to prosecutions due to COVID-19.</p></authorialNote>. These primarily relate to strict liability offences such as environmental, trading or health and safety offences. The government has recognised that the law must be improved to hold corporates accountable where their employees or other associated persons commit fraud. </p>

          <p>A defence would be available where ‘reasonable procedures’ for the prevention of fraud had been implemented by the organisation (thus mirroring the approach taken in the CF 2017 for failure to prevent the criminal facilitation of tax evasion), with provision that in some circumstances it may be reasonable for no such procedures to be in place. The statutory defence in BA 2010 (failure to prevent bribery) is ‘adequate procedures’; the standard of ‘reasonable procedures’ has been determined to be no more onerous than that of ‘adequate’ procedures. </p>

          <p>The offence will not have extra-territorial reach beyond the United Kingdom. The offence will only apply where the employee or associated person commits a relevant fraud offence under the law of part of the UK. This usually requires that one of the acts which was part of the underlying fraud took place in the UK, but for some offences, it is enough that the intended gain or loss occurred, or was intended to occur, in the UK. This is different from the ‘failure to prevent bribery’ offence, which applies if an organisation commits bribery outside the UK. This restriction will reduce the burden on organisations. </p>

          <p>The government is required to publish guidance on the procedures that organisations can put in place to prevent fraud. As an organisation’s defence depends on demonstrating that it has reasonable procedures, where applicable under the circumstances, it is likely that whether an organisation is compliant with guidance will be a benchmark for determining reasonableness. This guidance was not available when estimating the regulatory impacts on organisations. To estimate compliance costs it is assumed that the guidance would be broadly similar to guidance for the existing offences of failure to prevent bribery and failure to prevent tax evasion. </p>

          <p>Cost assessments of the different feasible civil options were not carried out, although the Law Commission did recommend that the implications for criminal justice costs should be examined if the civil route was selected. The large majority of costs are associated with implementing fraud prevention measures and these fall to businesses. It is likely that, in practice, these costs would be very similar to the costs presented in this IA, if the civil route had been selected.</p>

          <p>However, there can be perverse incentives to overlook fraud committed by others. There is a principal-agent problem which arises due to asymmetric information and is evident at several levels: the principal [shareholders] are unable to observe and monitor the actions of agents [managers] responsible for daily business activities. This creates an asymmetry of information, where managers may make decisions or pursue fraudulent actions for their own self-interest. By extension senior leadership may line manage staff who may also not act in keeping with corporate policy or engage in otherwise fraudulent conduct. </p>

          <p>However, in a micro, small, or medium company, it is expected to be easier to identify the perpetrator of a fraud than in a larger one. In 2022, the Law Commission noted that small organisations are more readily held to account using (then) existing corporate liability offences whilst large multi-national companies were able to evade action due to complex structures<authorialNote marker="21"><p> Section 3.69 to 3.72: “Corporate Criminal Liability: an options paper”, Law Commission 2022.</p></authorialNote>. The same discrepancy would also be expected to persist even after the introduction of the amendments to the identification principle<authorialNote marker="22"><p> The Law Commission report states “Even with a modest expansion of the identification principle this discrepancy would be likely to persist. If, for instance, the doctrine were expanded to allow identification on the basis of the culpability of a single senior manager , there will inevitably continue to be cases in which a small company would be convicted, but not a large company, because it would be inherently more likely that in the small firm senior managers would be closer to the level at which misconduct took place and therefore more likely to have the knowledge needed to fix the company with liability.” Note that this is exactly the amendment that was included in the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (sections 196 to 198).</p></authorialNote>. </p>

          <p>In smaller, less complex organisations, it is deemed more straightforward to prosecute and therefore the benefits of a failure to prevent fraud offence are significantly lower.

            <p>While the guidance set out the steps that organisations needed to take, the guidance does not set out the level of effort that organisations need to commit to. This means that the guidance alone does not allow the estimation of compliance costs for each step. Unfortunately, impact assessments or post-implementation reviews of other failure to prevent measures do not seem to exist, likely because both measures were introduced outside the better regulation framework<authorialNote marker="47"><p> The Bribery Act 2010 was introduced before the better regulation requirements were introduced under the Small Business, Enterprise and Employment Act 2015 (SBEE 2015); the failure to prevent tax evasion offence was introduced after SBEE 2015 but was introduced as a tax measure. </p></authorialNote>.

As the guidance for failure to prevent fraud offence was not published at the time of writing, no consultation on the assumptions was possible before submission of the IA to the RPC. Several steps were taken to mitigate the risk this presents, including drawing assumptions from comparable existing failure to prevent regulations, using sensitivity analysis and commitments in the post implementation review on the validity of the assumptions following the publishing of the guidance. </p>

          <p>For the cost scenarios it is assumed that transition costs incurred differently for organisations based on whether they have sufficient existing measures in place. For the high scenario, it is assumed that no firms have sufficient measures already in place and all firms incur familiarisation, risk assessment, communication, and training costs as transition costs. For the low and best scenarios, where a proportion of companies already have sufficient measures in place it is assumed that these companies deem themselves to have sufficient measures already in place and only undergo familiarisation and risk assessment costs as transition costs. Familiarisation and risk assessment costs are assumed to still be incurred as companies will still need to become familiar with regulation and undergo a risk assessment to ensure that their current anti-fraud measures are in fact sufficient. Further detail on the methodology can be found in Annex 2.</p>

          <p>The research on the impact of the Bribery Act 2010 clearly shows that compliance costs scale with organisation size<authorialNote marker="52"><p> Insight into awareness and impact of the Bribery Act 2010 Among small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs)<u> (publishing.service.gov.uk)</u>, page 29: <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a809f87e5274a2e8ab5134c/insight-into-awareness-and-impact-of-the-bribery-act-2010.pdf"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5a809f87e5274a2e8ab5134c/insight-into-awareness-and-impact-of-the-bribery-act-2010.pdf#page=32</u></a></p></authorialNote>.  This is likely because larger organisations are more complex and will require more labour and total time inputs to complete a task. In the analysis, this is reflected in larger project teams for larger organisations. The number of people in the team is also a function of the range of interests in the organisation that would be expected to be involved in the project. For example, to test systems against fraud it is not unreasonable to expect that project members would be drawn from: Finance, HR, Procurement, and IT functions.    The assumptions on project team size are given in Table 1. </p>

For the low and best scenarios, where a proportion of companies already have sufficient measures in place. It is assumed that those companies which deem themselves to have sufficient measures already in place undergo no ongoing costs. For the high scenario, it is assumed that no firms have sufficient measures already in place and all firms incur familiarisation, risk assessment, communication, and training costs as on-going costs.</p>

          <p>Ongoing risk assessment costs are calculated in the same way as they were for set-up. It is assumed that the risk assessment is refreshed annually but the costs of the refresh are much lower at 10 per cent of the set-up cost. This implies between 10 to 13 person hours each year to refresh the risk assessment in light of any events that have occurred during the year. It might also involve other tasks such as keeping central logs of training up to date. The cost is estimated to be £304 for large organisations and £374 for largest organisations. </p>

            <p>This comparison suggests that estimated <b>set up costs are</b> higher for large and largest organisations than for medium businesses in the research. This is explainable given that training accounts for a high share of the costs for the largest organisations and that employment is disproportionately concentrated in the largest organisations. These will therefore have much higher costs per organisation given that costs partly scale with employment.</p>

            <p>On-going costs for large organisations are less than the research suggests for medium organisations; however, average costs for the largest organisations are higher but are perhaps not as high as might be expected. This suggests that the on-going costs in this IA could be underestimating for large business. There is a possibility that is this is partly explained by the increase in average UK job tenure since the research was undertaken<authorialNote marker="71"><p> Employment by job tenure intervals - average job tenure OECD: <a href="https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TENURE_AVE"><u>https://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=TENURE_AVE#</u></a>   </p></authorialNote>. However, this is unlikely to explain the whole difference. Consequently, the scale of ongoing costs incurred by organisations will be directly considered as an evaluation question in the post implementation review.</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding this, given the absence of information to work from in assessing the costs to large and largest organisations, this analysis suggests that the IA cost estimates are a mostly reasonable attempt to capture the cost implications of this policy. However, the comparison also underlines the importance of obtaining data to understand the validity of this IA’s compliance cost estimates, especially on-going costs, in the first post-implementation review. </p>

          <p>Some public sector bodies such as Local Authorities and NHS Trusts will be affected by the measure. It has not been possible to ascertain the number of organisations that fall into the large and the largest categories and therefore in scope of the legislation. Therefore, the costs to the public sector are non-monetised in this analysis. The average costs per public sector organisation that falls under the legislation is expected to be similar to those experienced by the entities costed in this IA. It is expected that a number of these public sector bodies will have sufficient anti-fraud procedures already in place and therefore will not occur the full amount of additional costs as a result of this legislation. However, the proportion of public sector bodies which have these already in place is uncertain. The cost of this policy to public sector bodies will be specifically covered in the post implementation review. </p>

          <p>The main benefit of this legislation is the cultural change it is intended to create. This change is expected to result in a deterrent effect where increased awareness and corporate liability may deter would-be fraudsters. The threat of criminal liability will encourage organisations to put fraud-prevention measures in place which can reduce fraud as:</p>

            <p>The new offence allows for an organisation to be held responsible for failing to prevent fraud carried out by any employee or other associated person: Historically corporate criminal offences have applied only when the person considered to be the “directing mind” of the organisation has committed the offence. In large organisations, where junior management may historically have committed offences to inflate their teams’ performance to senior management, the scale of offences and subsequent losses may be considerable. A new failure to prevent fraud offence aims to incentivise organisations to stop these offences taking place and therefore is likely to reduce the level of fraud and associated losses.</p>

            <p>It can enable increased detection of fraudulent conduct. Staff awareness of fraud will increase their ability to detect fraud by others and reduce the temptation to conduct fraudulent activity themselves. The benefits rely somewhat on the cultural changes that are expected when most large organisations are in scope.</p>

          <p>Training costs are around 70 per cent of the total cost of this legislation in the central scenario. The assumptions used to estimate training costs were based on similar comparable to failure to prevent bribery training. The lack of existing guidance on the failure to prevent fraud offence means that there is a degree of remaining uncertainty around the training costs. This prevents training costs assumptions being tailored precisely to the legislation and the ability to test any assumptions with stakeholders. </p>

This is consistent with fee schedules on websites offering anti-bribery training, see: <a href="https://www.virtual-college.co.uk/courses/compliance/the-bribery-act-2010"><u>https://www.virtual-college.co.uk/courses/compliance/the-bribery-act-2010</u></a> </p></authorialNote>.

This shows that, a 10 per cent change in the training discount results in a 5 per cent change in the NPSV.  For the central scenario, if the training discount fee was only at 10 per cent the NPSV for the policy would decrease to <b>-£1,006.6m (PV 2024).</b> If the training discount rate is higher at 60 per cent then the NPSV increases to <b>-£785.1m (PV 2024).</b></p>

The main assumption is that all employees will be required to undertake training.  This assumption is deemed reasonable as organisations will not know who is likely to commit fraud. As the burden of proof is on the organisation to take all reasonable steps to prevent fraud, the analysis assumes that an organisation is likely to train all staff.</p>

          <p>Another important assumption in this assessment is around core team size. For the largest firms, this is assumed to be five full-time staff, with four assumed to be the core team size of large firms. In both cases these teams are managed by a project director who dedicates 20 per cent of their time to the project. This input from senior staff is based on the current Bribery Act 2010 guidance which states that processes should show “top level commitment”. The assumption on the level of staffing in the central scenario was provided by DBT therefore sensitivity analysis assesses the effect of core size on NPSV. </p>

          <p>Table 17 shows the effect on NPSV if firms of both sizes had increased or decreased the size of their core teams relative to the central scenario in the analysis. If the firms had a smaller core team size, to three staff for large firms and four for the largest firms, NPSV would increase to around <b>-£820.9 million</b> <b>(PV 2024)</b>. If firms had increased core team size, to six for the largest firms and five for large firms, NPSV would increase to <b>-£926.5 million </b><b>(PV 2024)</b> in the central scenario. </p>

In 2022, the Law Commission noted that small organisations are more readily held to account using (then) existing corporate liability offences<authorialNote marker="92"><p> This means the existing identification principle, prior to the amendments in the Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 (sections 196 to 198) at: <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/56/part/5/crossheading/attributing-criminal-liability-for-economic-crimes-to-certain-bodies"><u>https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2023/56/part/5/crossheading/attributing-criminal-liability-for-economic-crimes-to-certain-bodies</u></a> Prior to this amendment, a corporate could only be held responsible for an economic crime if the crime was committed by the “directing mind and will” of the company – something that was difficult to establish, particularly in large corporations with complex structures.</p></authorialNote> whilst large multi-national companies were able to evade action due to complex structures<authorialNote marker="93"><p> Section 3.69 to 3.72: “Corporate Criminal Liability: an options paper”, Law Commission 2022: <a href="https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloud-platform-e218f50a4812967ba1215eaecede923f/uploads/sites/30/2022/06/Corporate-Criminal-Liability-Options-Paper_LC.pdf"><u>https://s3-eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/cloud-platform-e218f50a4812967ba1215eaecede923f/uploads/sites/30/2022/06/Corporate-Criminal-Liability-Options-Paper_LC.pdf#page=55</u></a></p></authorialNote> and also noted that the same discrepancy would be expected to persist even after the introduction of the amendments to the identification principle<authorialNote marker="94"><p> The Law Commission report states “Even with a modest expansion of the identification principle this discrepancy would be likely to persist. If, for instance, the doctrine were expanded to allow identification on the basis of the culpability of a single senior manager , there will inevitably continue to be cases in which a small company would be convicted, but not a large company, because it would be inherently more likely that in the small firm senior managers would be closer to the level at which misconduct took place and therefore more likely to have the knowledge needed to fix the company with liability.” Note that this is exactly the amendment that was included in the Economic Crime and Corporate transparency Act 2023 (sections 196 to 198).</p></authorialNote>.  </p>

          <p>In smaller, less complex organisations, it is deemed more straightforward to prosecute and therefore the potential benefits of a failure to prevent fraud offence are significantly lower when applied to these SMBs.  At the same time, they would potentially face disproportionate implementation burdens if not exempt. Consequently, the government decided to restrict the offence of failure to prevent fraud to large organisations only. </p>

          <p>As discussed in paragraphs 53 to 54, the definition of large business used in the ECCT 2023 is different to the new definition in the “Medium sized business regulatory exemption assessment: supplementary guidance”. Using the latter definition would lead to all businesses with fewer than 500 employees from being exempt from the offence and would therefore be likely to significantly reduce the intended effects of the FTPF measure.</p>

          <p>Large organisations may put contractual clauses on small ones that provide services for them or on their behalf. This may result in small and medium and micro-businesses incurring some costs in relation to putting in place anti-fraud procedures. The associated costs are expected to be low, since the anti-fraud procedures would be restricted to measures designed to prevent the contractors (the small companies) from committing fraud that benefits the large organisation or its clients.</p>

          <p>There is a very small risk that large organisations in scope of this legislation are deterred from engaging with organisations that are out of scope of this legislation.  Large organisations in scope of this legislation could perceive those not covered by this legislation as more likely to pose a higher risk of fraud. This could result in large organisations passing up engagement with companies not covered by this legislation, which do not have to put fraud procedures in place, in favour of companies which are covered by this legislation where the perceived risk of fraud could be lower.</p>

          <p>Whilst the ECS is the best available evidence for estimating the proportion of organisations that have existing fraud prevention measures, there are four main risks arising from the use of ECS: (1) The ECS dates from 2020 and may be outdated despite being the most recent data available, (2) the results cover the full range of organisational sizes and may not be representative for the just the large and largest organisations that are in scope of this legislation,(3) that the proportion of companies that have anti-fraud measures and anti-fraud training in place are not accurate proxies from which to estimate low and central scenarios from and (4) the fraud prevention measures that some companies report having in the ECS does not cover fraud committed for the benefit of the organisation, therefore they do not accurately reflect the measures that would align with the guidance. The impact of these risks could be that the estimates of the low and best cost scenarios are not accurate. Consequently, sensitivity analysis has been conducted to demonstrate how the overall cost of implementing the FTFP could change if the proportion of companies that need to put in place sufficient measures varied from the scenarios. </p>

          <p>A significant risk is that the IA was finished before the guidance for the legislation has been produced and published. This means that there is a risk that there is a misalignment between the IA and the guidance. This risk is mitigated by drawing guidance from existing failure to prevent legislation- taking the assumption that the guidance for the failure to prevent fraud offence will be similar. However, there is a remaining risk that the guidance deviates from previous guidance for other failure to prevent offences. This risk has been mitigated by including additional sensitivity analysis to understand the impact of changes to the assumptions on the overall estimates. Additionally, the post implementation review will specifically evaluate the validity of the assumptions following the guidance being published and any impacts of this on the overall NPSV of this policy.</p>

          <p>This risk is compounded by the inability to test assumptions with stakeholders, as would usually be expected, due to the guidance not being published at the time of writing this IA. The risk presented by this was mitigated though transparency in the evidence and rationale behind the generation of the assumptions - that they have been drawn from existing failure to prevent offences. Alongside this, sensitivity analysis of has been undertaken to understand the impact on the overall NPSV of the assumptions deviating from the estimate used in the IA. Additionally, these assumptions will be tested in the post implementation review through assumption specific evaluation questions to understand the accuracy of those used in the analysis.</p>

            <p>The training costs are DBT internal estimates based on market costs and durations for comparable training courses. This includes a discount on the per person fee for large and largest companies. The size of the discount was based on providers offering courses for similar offences (for example, failure to prevent bribery). Some providers noted and provided indicative discounts for larger training cohorts.  As training costs are around 70 per cent of the total cost of this legislation in the central scenario. There is a risk that if the discount estimate is not reflective on the true discount being provided for training in large and largest organisations then there could be a significant impact on overall cost of this legislation to businesses. The risk is mitigated by undertaking sensitivity analysis to explore how the cost of the policy changes in the face of varying these assumptions and having specific evaluation questions on assumptions in the post implementation review to understand their validity.</p>

            <p>A main assumption for training costs is that all employees will be required to undertake training.  This assumption is deemed reasonable as organisations will not know who is likely to commit fraud. As the burden of proof is on the organisation to take all reasonable steps to prevent fraud, the analysis assumes that an organisation is likely to train all staff. However, the lack of guidance meant it was impossible to test this assumption with stakeholders. The risk is mitigated by undertaking sensitivity analysis to explore how the cost of the policy changes in the face of varying these assumptions.  Additionally, these assumptions will be tested in the post implementation review through assumption specific evaluation questions to understand the accuracy of those used in the analysis.</p>

          <p>There is a possibility that the there is an unintended impact on the behaviour of organisations that are already putting place sufficient anti-fraud procedures. There is a chance that this firms may further improve their behaviours so to maintain a higher standard of anti-fraud procedures than organisations. This is especially likely to be the case for organisations which market or pride themselves on having better anti-fraud procedures than others. In this case this may cause organisations to incur costs even when they already meet the procedures that would provide them sufficient defence in the event of prosecution.</p>

This may arise from organisations who fall under this legislation incurring the additional costs associated with the policy. This could be especially true for organisations just either side of the inclusion criteria, with organisations falling just below the thresholds and not incurring any costs gaining an advantage against competitors who fall above the threshold and do incur costs. However, it is very unlikely that the average cost to a business around the threshold are large enough to produce any meaningful competitive disadvantage for those who incur the costs. </p>

          <p>The FAME sizing data was sparse for the entity count so, the same approach was applied to size other organisations, that is to assume it follows the distribution of companies with staff. This is a reasonable assumption as data from the National Council for Voluntary Organisations (NCVO) shows that the size distribution of general charities is skewed in a similar way to companies<authorialNote marker="109"><p> <a href="https://www.ncvo.org.uk/news-and-insights/news-index/uk-civil-society-almanac-2021/profile/voluntary-sector-definition/"><u>https://www.ncvo.org.uk/news-and-insights/news-index/uk-civil-society-almanac-2021/profile/voluntary-sector-definition/#/</u></a>. For example, only 0.04 per cent of general charities had income exceeding £100 million and over 44 per cent had an income of less than £10,000. Voluntary organisation size categories in the NCVO data did not map readily to Companies Act 2006 thresholds hence the need for assumption was important. </p></authorialNote>.  </p>

Small, medium, and micro-businesses will be exempt and are out of scope of this policy. This is to reduce the compliance burden on smaller organisations, who will have fewer resources to enable them to understand and implement reasonable fraud prevention procedures.
