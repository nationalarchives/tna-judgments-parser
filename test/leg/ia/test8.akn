                <p class="ia-table-text">There is overwhelming scientific consensus that we are living with the effects of significant global climate change, driven predominantly by anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Global action is needed to mitigate the potentially catastrophic impact of climate change across the world, and to help secure the UK’s long-term economic security. Action to limit emissions would not happen at sufficient scale without government intervention, as the costs are not fully factored into private decisions. In 2019, the government amended the Climate Change Act to set a net zero target in law, for 2050. The UK has also committed to the 2015 Paris Agreement, which affirms the global ambition to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C.</p>

The Act requires this level must be set with a view to reducing emissions to net zero by 2050. The objective now is to set the level of the budget, with proposals on how the budget is met to be published as soon as reasonably practical thereafter.</p>

Emissions savings are valued using the High Carbon Value series, with the Central series tested as a sensitivity. High and low fuel costs and GDP projections are also tested as sensitivities. National damage costs are used to value air quality impacts. As a sensitivity, the impact of removing the wealth element of the social discount rate for emissions savings is tested. </p>

          <p>The Climate Change Act requires Parliament to set the level of the sixth carbon budget, covering the five year period 2033 to 2037, with a view to meeting the target of reducing the UK’s net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by at least 100% (“net zero”) by 2050. </p>

          <p>There is overwhelming scientific consensus that we are living with the effects of significant global climate change, driven primarily by anthropogenic GHG emissions. Unchecked this will lead to rising temperatures and sea levels, extreme weather, damaged ecosystems, and reduced productivity of crops. Coordinated global action is needed to substantially reduce GHG emissions and mitigate the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change on the environment and economies across the world. </p>

          <p>Setting long-term targets to reduce GHG emissions will also help to secure long-term economic security and prosperity, globally and in the UK. While there is inherent uncertainty around estimates of the long-term impact of climate change, at global level it is clear that the cost of inaction is much higher than the cost of action. Without government intervention individual efforts to mitigate climate change are unlikely to be sufficient.</p>

          <p>When setting carbon budgets, the government must take account of the advice of the Climate Change Committee (CCC). The CCC recommends the sixth carbon budget is set at 965MtCO2e, implying a 78% reduction in emissions from 1990 to 2035. The government has conducted its own analysis, based on our own analytical assumptions, which includes consideration of this recommended budget level. Our assessment of this overall budget level is separate from our consideration of the CCC’s policy recommendations to achieve the emissions abatement needed to meet the budget. The budget must also be set with a view to complying with the UK’s wider international obligations, and accounting for any representations of the Devolved Administrations.</p>

          <p>The Impact Assessment concludes that <b>the CCC’s recommended option for the sixth carbon budget level is the preferred option</b>, which best supports the UK’s policy objective to substantially reduce GHG emissions and brings significant benefits for society. This Impact Assessment does not put forward the government policies needed to meet the different sixth carbon budget options. It presents an illustrative assessment of possible pathways through the sixth carbon budget period to 2050, recognising the uncertainty whilst still allowing an assessment of the key costs, benefits, risks and opportunities of different budget levels. </p>

          <p>Apart from the “do nothing” option, the analysis assumes that all emissions pathways to 2050 meet existing UK commitments. This includes the UK’s Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) to reduce emissions by at least 68% by 2030 compared to 1990 (excluding IAS emissions), which is more ambitious than the fifth carbon budget covering 2028-32. The analysis also assumes emissions decline linearly from the end of the sixth carbon budget to reach the legislated target of net zero emissions by 2050. Not all costs and benefits presented are additional to current government ambition or policy plans, but this does not impact the<i> relative</i> difference in costs and benefits between options for the sixth carbon budget.</p>

          <p>Increasing ambition from Option 2 to 3 (CCC recommended level) has limited effect on land-use, agriculture, and engineered removals of emissions as feasible cost-effective abatement is already exhausted in these sectors in Option 2. Electrification over the sixth carbon budget period increases by around 13% in Option 3 compared to Option 2. However, high use of hydrogen for heating by 2050 still remains feasible with additional effort in other sectors (e.g., land use and transport) to offset slower decarbonisation in buildings (as widescale hydrogen heating is unlikely to be available by the mid-2030s). Sectors pushed further in Option 3, indicating higher marginal costs, include surface transport, fuel supply, industry, and buildings. The tightest budget level considered, Option 4, involves going even further in the transport, industry, fuel supply and buildings sectors, stretching technical feasibility and potentially leading to non-economical outcomes in transport.</p>

          <p>All options but ‘do nothing’ would require substantial additional effort across each sector of the economy, beyond existing government plans. Consumers and producers will need to change the technologies they use, and in many cases the up-front costs of low carbon technologies, such as heat pumps, are currently higher than the technologies they replace. Supply chains for low carbon technologies will need to be significantly scaled up and, in some cases, need to be demonstrated before they can move to wider-scale deployment. Government intervention will be needed to overcome a broad range of barriers, including technical, market, behavioural and socio-political. In addition to maximising market-led decarbonisation, strengthening regulation is likely to be necessary in some cases.</p>

          <p>The budget options are also compared against global average emissions in pathways that are aligned with the Paris Agreement’s climate change mitigation ambition. All options apart from ‘do nothing’ deliver emission reductions on a per capita basis that, if followed globally, would be consistent with the global ambition to keep the increase in global average temperature in line with the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal. Relative to Option 2, Options 3 and Option 4 would fare more favourably from a global climate leadership perspective by delivering faster emission reductions and resulting in lower cumulative emissions to 2050. Although there is uncertainty, the different trajectories lead to different outcomes, and looser pathways, all else being equal, will lead to higher global temperature, higher risks of extreme events or require greater reliance on GHG removal technologies in the long-term to meet the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal.</p>

          <p>This criterion quantifies as many costs and benefits as possible related to the level of the sixth carbon budget.  The long-lived nature of technologies means many of these costs and benefits occur before the sixth carbon budget period begins and endure after it has ended. Moreover, the level of the sixth carbon budget will have a large bearing on the overall pathway to net zero in 2050. The appraisal therefore considers costs and benefits over the period from 2020 to 2050. However, the cost-benefit analysis should not be seen as a full appraisal of the UK’s decision to achieve net zero by 2050. It is not exhaustive: it does not, for example, quantify potential industrial opportunities or transition risks, which will depend on how the budget is delivered, and wider co-benefits such as health outcomes.</p>

          <p>The majority of quantified benefits are emissions savings, with fossil fuel savings, air quality improvements and other natural capital impacts constituting the remaining benefits. Non-carbon benefits do not differ significantly between options. The large majority of costs are the additional capital costs (and associated financing) of low carbon technologies. Significant fuel savings are expected, offsetting 20% of additional capital costs. It is estimated that the net cost (excluding air quality and emissions savings benefits) of meeting the CCC’s recommend sixth carbon budget level will be equivalent to 1.6% of GDP in 2035.</p>

          <p>Options 2 to 4 have significantly positive net present values (NPVs), with quantified benefits more than offsetting the costs. Results are sensitive to modelling assumptions – most notably, the NPVs increase in a high Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) scenario and decrease if CCS were delayed. Less ambitious options have marginally higher NPVs than more ambitious levels, indicating that the marginal cost of abatement is higher than government’s current high carbon values. However, differences between options are small in percentage terms: for example, the NPV for Option 2 is £23bn higher than Option 3 in the core pathway, a difference of 9%.</p>

        <content>
          <p>There is considerable uncertainty around NPV estimates, especially while the policies to meet the budget are not confirmed. For example, tighter budget levels could have the potential to increase the rate of technology cost reductions (particularly those where cost reduction is driven by UK rather than global deployment), and also increase the value of additional exports of UK low carbon technologies. There is also, however, a possibility that the UK could benefit from cost reductions driven by technological deployment in other countries which choose to decarbonise faster, balanced against the risk that less action from the UK would slow global efforts and so result in higher costs for all.</p>

          <p>Increased climate ambition can foster innovation that increases domestic competitiveness and provides potential export opportunities for some sectors. But there will also be risks to competitiveness, particularly for sectors that are trade-exposed or carbon intensive, and these risks are greater if the UK's climate ambition continues to exceed that of trading partners. Other countries could also benefit from earlier UK investment and cost reduction in key technologies, which could help support global decarbonisation but presents potential risks to UK competitiveness that would have to be managed.  </p>

          <p>Considering all assessment criteria in the round, including specific factors set out in the Climate Change Act, <b>the proposed option for the sixth carbon budget level is 965MtCO</b><b>2</b><b>e, Option 3</b>. This option is the recommended level by the CCC and the preferred option of the Devolved Administrations. The high level of ambition supports the overall policy objective of mitigating the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change, while the more ambitious Option 4 could lead to non-economical outcomes. Option 3 is more challenging than Option 2 from a technical feasibility and delivery perspective, but the analysis shows it is technically feasible to achieve and has a strongly positive NPV. Option 3 is also in line with an ambitious contribution to global efforts towards meeting the Paris Agreement temperature goal and strengthens the UK position in pushing for higher ambition from other countries. Whilst the costs of this option are higher and the NPV is smaller than those of Option 2, these relative differences are within the uncertainty ranges and in the whole outweighed by the other assessment criteria.  </p>

The Climate Change Act requires Parliament to set the level of the sixth carbon budget, covering 2033 to 2037, by 30th June 2021.

          <p>The Climate Change Act specifies that the level of the sixth carbon budget must be set with a view to meeting the target of reducing net UK emissions by at least 100% (“net zero”) by 2050.The budget must also be set with a view to complying with the UK’s wider international obligations. The UK has also committed to the 2015 Paris Agreement, which affirms the global ambition to keep the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C. In setting the level of the sixth carbon budget the government must take into account the advice of the CCC and any representations of the Devolved Administrations. </p>

          <p>Once the sixth carbon budget is set in legislation, the Act requires the government to publish a report on the policies and proposals to deliver the budget (and those carbon budgets up to this point) ‘as soon as is reasonably practicable’ thereafter. As details of policies and proposals to meet the sixth carbon budget are still being finalised, this Impact Assessment considers, at a high level, the illustrative impacts of meeting different budget levels. It does not make specific assumptions on how the sixth carbon budget will be delivered, including the policy recommendations put forward by the CCC in their sixth carbon budget advice.</p>

          <p>The CCC is an independent statutory body that advises the UK and devolved administration governments on setting and meeting carbon budgets and preparing for climate change. Under section 34 of the Act the CCC must advise on: the level of each carbon budget; the extent to which the carbon budget should be met through reducing net UK emissions or through the purchase of carbon units from overseas; and the respective contributions that different sectors should make; and in doing so it must take into account certain matters specified under the Act (section 10).</p>

          <p>The CCC published its advice on the sixth carbon budget on 9th December 2020. It recommends that the sixth carbon budget be set at 965MtCO2e, implying a 78% reduction in emissions from 1990 to 2035. The CCC recognise that this target would achieve well over half of the required emissions reductions required from 2020 to 2050 in the next 15 years – implying an average annual reduction of 21MtCO2e between 2019 and 2035, compared to 13MtCO2e between 2035 and 2050. The CCC advise that the budget should be set on the basis of territorial UK emissions; inclusive of emissions from international aviation and shipping (IAS) and wetlands; and using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report Global Warming Potentials (see section 1.4 on accounting and scope). The CCC also advise that the budget should be met without purchase of international credits.</p>

          <p>While the CCC’s advice also makes recommendations on how to meet the sixth carbon budget level, this Impact Assessment does not set out how the sixth carbon budget will be delivered. The government will set out its own delivery plan with policies in line with its own priorities and assumptions. In modelling options, this analysis also makes different assumptions in some areas to the CCC – notably, the CCC’s analysis includes some changes in consumption patterns that are not modelled here. For example, this analysis does not assume a shift in people’s dietary patterns. The full portfolio of policies to deliver the budget level is not decided at this stage, though the analysis does give a sense of the challenge.</p>

          <p>The fifth carbon budget was set in 2016, before the 2050 target was changed to net zero in 2019. The CCC have advised that, while their recommended trajectory to net zero in 2050 implies emissions will have to fall more quickly than required by the existing carbon budgets (i.e. the fourth and fifth, covering 2023-27 and 2028-32), it is not necessary to amend the existing budget levels in legislation. The CCC consider that the advised sixth carbon budget level, combined with the UK’s NDC (which commits the UK to reducing emissions by at least 68% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels<authorialNote marker="4"><p> NDC excludes IAS emissions: /www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-uks-nationally-determined-contribution-communication-to-the-unfccc</p></authorialNote>) would set the UK on the path to net zero, but it is for the government to decide whether the existing budgets should be amended. </p>

          <p>The government does not consider it necessary to amend the level of any existing carbon budgets in legislation. The 2030 NDC and the proposed sixth carbon budget put the UK on track for net zero by 2050 and will necessarily entail overachieving on the 5th carbon budget. This analysis assumes that the UK will achieve the reduction in emissions needed to meet its 2030 NDC. The level of each of the first five carbon budgets are shown in the table below.</p>

          <p>There is overwhelming scientific consensus that we are living with the effects of significant global climate change, driven predominantly by anthropogenic GHG emissions. Unchecked this leads to rising temperatures and sea levels, extreme weather, damaged ecosystems, and reduced productivity of crops. Coordinated global action is needed to rapidly reduce GHG emissions and reach net zero, and so mitigate the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change on the environment and economies across the world, while ensuring that action also supports wider environmental sustainability, such as water quality and availability of raw materials. </p>

          <p>Setting long-term targets to reduce GHG emissions will also help secure long-term economic security and prosperity, globally and in the UK. While there is inherent uncertainty around estimates of the long-term impact of climate change, it is clear that at the global level the cost of inaction is much higher than the cost of action, as set out in the Stern Review<authorialNote marker="6"><p> Stern, N. (2007). <i>The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review</i>. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. doi:10.1017/CBO9780511817434</p></authorialNote> and the Impact Assessment for the Climate Change Act. GHG emissions are a global externality and emitters do not directly face the consequences of their actions or take these consequences fully into account when taking decisions. This is because climate change is global in both its causes and consequences; its impacts are long-term and persistent; there are few markets for GHG emissions and there are substantial uncertainties and risks over their economic impacts. As a result, without government intervention individual efforts to mitigate climate change are unlikely to reduce emissions on a sufficient scale.</p>

Three options have been selected to reflect an appropriate range of budget levels that are consistent with the 2030 NDC target and the 2050 Net Zero target. They include the CCC recommended budget level (Option 3), a higher budget level (Option 2) that is in line with the CCC’s ‘headwinds’ scenario and a lower budget level that is in line with the CCC’s ‘widespread innovation’ scenario (Option 4). All three options are compared to a ‘do-nothing’ baseline scenario based on the latest BEIS energy and emissions projections (see paragraph 33) (Option 1).</p>

          <p>This Impact Assessment assesses options using a holistic assessment framework that fulfils the requirements of the Climate Change Act across five assessment criteria. Section 10(2) of the Act requires the Secretary of State to take into account a non-exhaustive list of relevant matters when coming to a decision on setting a carbon budget. Of these matters, several can be quantified in detail, and are taken into account as part of consideration of criteria (1) – (4) below. Other matters are harder to quantify, and so are considered as ‘wider impacts’ in criterion (5). For completeness and to ensure compliance with the statutory framework, criterion (5) works through all of the section 10(2) factors, even where some have also been considered under earlier criteria. </p>

          <p>This criterion draws on both whole-system modelling and sector-specific evidence to identity different pathways that meet the UK’s 2050 Net Zero target. This ensures that the decision on the sixth carbon budget is not taken in isolation but in context of the UK’s long-term climate change target. Using the results of the long-term pathways and additional evidence on delivery challenges, this criterion assesses the extent to which least-cost technology mixes under the different carbon budget levels are consistent with least-cost mixes in 2050. It also considers the extent to which different options imply reliance on uncertain technologies or maximum feasible technology build rates.</p>

          <p>The accounting basis for the sixth carbon budget does not need to be finalised in law until 2039, when the 2037 annual statement of emissions will be published. Depending on future accounting decisions, carbon accounting regulations may be required to establish the applicable accounting framework. When assessing the different options for the sixth carbon budget level, this Impact Assessment has made assumptions about the specific scope and accounting framework for emissions as set out in the sections below.</p>

          <p>However, the international science behind measuring emissions is continually evolving and the assumptions made here do not therefore preclude future decisions that are still to be made on emissions accounting at both domestic and international level. If future accounting decisions turn out to differ from the assumptions made in this Impact Assessment, this would not automatically lead to a change in the budget level.  However, the Climate Change Act allows for legislated carbon budget levels to be amended if the government believes that, since the budget level was originally set, there have been significant changes affecting the basis on which the previous decision was made (Section 21 of the Climate Change Act).</p>

          <p>When setting previous carbon budgets, Impact Assessments followed a net accounting framework that constructed the total carbon budget as a sum of two individual components: i) emissions covered by the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS), known as “traded sector” emissions (around one third of all UK emissions); and ii) emissions outside the EU ETS known as “non-traded sector” emissions. When the UK was part of the EU ETS, the UK share of EU ETS allowances was used to calculate “traded sector” emissions, and emissions in the “non-traded sector” were measured as actually emitted.</p>

          <p>The UK has now left the European Union and is no longer a part of the EU ETS. A UK Emissions Trading Scheme, which is currently standalone, has been established in its place (although electricity generators in Northern Ireland continue to participate in the EU ETS). The CCC have made their recommendation to set the sixth carbon budget level on a territorial basis, i.e., accounting for all actual emissions occurring within the UK. This Impact Assessment assesses the carbon budget options on the same basis. This does not preclude any future decisions on the UK ETS or future carbon accounting regulations.</p>

          <p>The UK’s performance against its climate change targets is measured in terms of tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents (tCO2e). Emissions of each greenhouse gas covered by the Climate Change Act are expressed in CO2e, recognising the different global warming potentials (GWP) of the different gases. The IPCC have proposed an updated set of GWPs in their Fifth Assessment Report (AR5)<authorialNote marker="8"><p> AR5 Synthesis Report: Climate Change 2014, https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar5/syr/</p></authorialNote>, affecting the GWP of methane, nitrous oxide, and some F-gases. This update changes the CO2e of these gases, but there is still uncertainty around whether those values will be adopted internationally with or without carbon-cycle feedbacks. In either case, the values are different from the GWPs used in the current UK GHG inventory and it is expected that the updated values or even a subsequent update will be in place by the time of the sixth carbon budget period.</p>

          <p>To reflect this and ensure that the sixth carbon budget can still be met after these potential changes, the Impact Assessment uses the higher AR5 GWP values, i.e., those with carbon-cycle feedback. Compared to the GWP used in the current UK inventory, this affects the GWP of methane. This does not preclude a decision on which AR5 GWP values will be adopted internationally. The CCC’s advice on the sixth carbon budget follows the same approach. </p>

          <p>Overall, assumptions used in this Impact Assessment for peatlands emissions are about 4-5 MtCO2e per year higher than the estimates included in the GHG inventory 1990-2019 (the main differences being a different set of assumptions for forest soils). Taking a higher estimate in this analysis ensures that the sixth carbon budget can be met even in a scenario where peatland emissions are slightly higher than the assumptions currently considered as the most accurate. A similar approach was taken by the CCC in its analysis.</p>

          <p>The Climate Change Act allows the potential for the purchase of International Carbon Units (ICUs) to count against meeting carbon budgets. The Act places a statutory duty upon government to set a limit on the quantity of ICUs that can be used to meet a carbon budget. This ICU credit limit, which caps the net amount of ICUs that can be credited to the net UK carbon account for that budgetary period, must be set in legislation 18 months ahead of the start of each budget. The level of the credit limit provides the extent to which abatement in other countries can be procured in place of abatement in the UK where more cost effective or otherwise beneficial. The CCC recommends “that ICUs should not be used to meet the sixth carbon budget, though they may be useful policy tools or appropriate ways to go beyond the carbon budgets to support global decarbonisation efforts”. Noting that any purchase of ICUs is a decision for the future, this analysis only considers domestic action to meet the sixth carbon budget. This does not preclude any future decisions on the use of ICUs.</p>

          <p>There are also localised equalities impacts arising from the adverse effects of climate change, although we cannot identify these for the different budget options considered. As an example, health impacts can disproportionately impact different demographics in society, including those with protected characteristics. Research has found the worst levels of air pollution are experienced by those living in the 10% most deprived areas in the UK, regions which have a higher proportion of Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) populations.<authorialNote marker="27"><p> UK notification to the European Commission to extend the compliance deadline for meeting PM10 limit values in ambient air to 2011, Racial equality impact assessment (England) (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110710192634if_/http://www.endsreport.com/docs/20090820a.pdf"><u>https://web.archive.org/web/20110710192634if_/http://www.endsreport.com/docs/20090820a.pdf</u></a>)</p></authorialNote></p>

          <p>Making the transition to net zero in the UK could also impact those with protected characteristics disproportionately, for instance if emerging green jobs were concentrated in sectors that currently have poor diversity, or changing household bills or taxes were to particularly impact specific groups. In transitioning to net zero and bringing forward policies in future, government will need to consider ways to ensure it is representative of people with protected characteristics, while minimising any potential negative impacts.</p>

            <p><u>Strengths and limitations</u>: a particular advantage of UKTM is that it identifies the least-cost technology pathway for a given set of assumptions, taking account of interactions across energy supply and end-use sectors over time. The model is therefore useful for identifying which technologies could be essential, or important in the long run for achieving a low cost, low carbon system and the appropriate sequencing of abatement opportunities. However, there are a number of limitations to the modelling: </p>

            <content>
              <p>The model does not directly take account of opportunities or risks to costs and meeting future targets resulting from uncertainty around technological, economic, social, institutional, and environmental factors, or potential benefits and upside risks from technology deployment reducing costs (e.g. learning by doing), including from global action. To assess the uncertainty around these factors various technology scenarios and sensitivities have been analysed, see further detail in section 2.2.</p>

              <p>Not all costs and benefits are accounted for in the model. In particular, there are likely to be additional barriers beside cost and technical build rates that could constrain the realisation of options that UKTM analysis suggests may be important in 2035 or 2050. These barriers are considered separately in section 2.3. Potential industrial benefits and risks (e.g. market opportunities from developing and deploying low-carbon technologies or transition risks) are not captured in the model and are therefore considered separately.</p>

Given the uncertainty around these assumptions, for the purposes of this Impact Assessment, four net zero pathways have been developed representing different technology availability and resource conditions.  Each sixth carbon budget option, presented in section 1.7, is tested against a range of alternative futures for key technologies and resources:</p>

The emissions picture in 2050 is fairly stable despite the range of uncertainties tested due to the relatively limited solution space to get to net zero.  In all pathways the near full decarbonisation of all end-use sectors and deployment of negative emissions technologies at scale will be required by 2050 based on assumptions about the future performance and availability of key technologies.</p>

          <p>When tested, the 2050 least-cost technology mix is not sensitive to the relatively narrow bound of sixth carbon budget options (Options 2-4) considered in this Impact Assessment. Tighter budget levels do not lock-in higher cost solutions, while looser budgets do not restrict achievement of the 2050 least-cost mix. The impact of varying the budget is mainly to shift the distribution over time of decarbonisation effort and costs between the sixth carbon budget and subsequent budgets. For this reason, all subsequent figures, unless otherwise stated, are consistent with Option 3. The costs and benefits of alternative sixth carbon budget options are assessed in detail in section 2.5. </p>

          <p>The cost-optimal technology and energy mix is more affected by the uncertainty arising from technology and resource availability than by the choice of the sixth carbon budget level. All pathways at least double current electricity generation by 2050 and rely on substantial hydrogen production and biomass use. However, the final energy mix is highly variable depending on the modelling assumptions. The table below summarises the modelled range of energy use. </p>

          <p><b>Electrification </b>of transport, certain industrial processes and some heat for buildings is crucial in all scenarios by 2050. However, the extent of electrification in 2050, and therefore electricity demand, varies depending on the modelling assumptions. The highest level of electrification is seen in the CCS delay pathway because technology delay in CCS limits the scope for hydrogen from CCS-enabled domestic production. As a result, hydrogen from CCS is replaced by greater amounts of electrolysis which has additional electricity requirements even if surplus generation from variable renewables is used. The lowest level of electrification is seen in the high resource pathway due to greater hydrogen use in the buildings sector. </p>

          <p>Given the pivotal role of<b> </b>electricity in delivering net zero emissions, the modelling suggests a fully decarbonised power system by 2050 (with small amounts of residual emissions reflecting CCS capture rates below 100%). There is inherent uncertainty over what that system will look like. Modelling for the Energy White Paper has shown that there is no single optimal technology mix for 2050 with many capacity mixes being able to meet different carbon emissions levels at relatively low cost. The power sector needed will depend on the level of demand, and the cost and availability of low-carbon technologies, particularly low-cost clean hydrogen.</p>

          <p>Based on the modelled core pathway, in 2050 the majority of <b>hydrogen</b> is used in shipping and industrial processes, with some also used for HGVs, electricity production and to provide heating in buildings. The extent to which hydrogen is used across the economy depends on the availability of technologies used in its production and their relative cost and efficiency, which is subject to considerable uncertainty (e.g. CCS performance, availability of renewable electricity and biomass). In the high resource pathway, widespread use of hydrogen in buildings’ heating is modelled, leading to higher levels of hydrogen demand. The high CCS pathway also sees a relative increase in hydrogen use (e.g. for industrial fuel switching) as a result of higher capture rates reducing the emissions intensity of CCUS-enabled hydrogen production.<authorialNote marker="35"><p> UKTM hydrogen cost assumptions are based on the assumption that a new hydrogen grid is built and costs for decommissioning or repurposing the gas grid are not included. If this is more or less costly than assumed in the modelling, findings from the UKTM modelling presented here could understate or overstate the role for hydrogen in meeting 2050 targets.</p></authorialNote></p>

          <p>In the core pathway, hydrogen is supplied through a mix of methane reformation with CCS, biomass gasification with CCS (BECCS) and electrolysis, with a smaller role for waste gasification. In the CCS delay pathway, lower capture rates, delayed CCS availability and high renewable electricity deployment lead to more electrolysis and less methane reformation with CCS, while the converse happens in the high CCS scenario.  In the high resource pathway, there is substantially higher demand for hydrogen due to widespread use in heat; the additional demand is mostly met through methane reformation with CCS due to cross-cutting constraints on other resources such as biomass. Across all pathways, the role of BECCS is particularly uncertain as it depends on the availability of biomass and the benefits of using biomass in hydrogen production relative to use in other sectors such as industry and electricity generation. </p>

          <p>A further area of considerable uncertainty is the availability and use of sustainable <b>biomass</b>. Based on modelling assumptions, substantial availability of biomass (consistent with 53kha/yr planting rates in the core pathway) is required by 2050 to enable negative emission technologies (bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage or BECCS), though use of biomass on the pathway to 2050 is less certain. Much of this land would be in competition with afforestation and the combined rate of land use change presents a risk to natural capital, as set out in section 2.6. Biomass and biomass products are used in industry, electricity generation, hydrogen production and in heating buildings and also transport (primarily aviation). There are considerable uncertainties around the development and costs of biomass to 2050 (including domestic production and availability of imports). Hence, the model may be over-reliant on biomass to meet emissions constraints. </p>

          <p>The modelling indicates that there is a potential residual <b>role for fossil fuels</b> even in 2050, albeit much reduced. The share of fossil fuel products in final energy consumptions is expected to reduce from around 80% today to less than 20% in 2050 and is only prevalent in the hardest to abate sectors of the economy. Residual oil/petroleum use is primarily in the aviation sector, while natural gas use is limited to CCS enabled technologies (e.g. production of hydrogen and combustion for electricity generation).</p>

If the UK were to keep options open to accommodate the different potential outcomes in 2050, then by 2035 the UKTM modelling suggests that for any given level of the sixth carbon budget there should be:</p>

          <p><b>Tightening the sixth carbon budget progressively</b> from Option 2 to Option 3 has limited to no effect on land-use, agriculture, and removals emissions as feasible cost-effective abatement is already exhausted at the looser budget level. Electrification increases by around 12% in Option 3 compared to Option 2 under the core pathway, requiring more low carbon generation capacity. Option 3 does not rule out hydrogen for heating as a long-term option, but a hydrogen pathway for buildings would require additional decarbonisation options in buildings (such as heat pumps) or additional effort in other sectors (e.g. land use and transport) to account for widescale hydrogen heating being less available by the mid-2030s than electrification.</p>

          <p>The tightest budget level considered, Option 4, involves going even further in the transport, industry, fuel supply and buildings sectors.  In particular, the cost-optimal pathways for this sixth carbon budget level imply a large acceleration in the decarbonisation of domestic transport which is likely to be very challenging and costly from a delivery perspective (i.e. the rate of adoption exceeds the natural stock turnover of cars and vans). Furthermore, there is some evidence that the tightest sixth carbon budget level considered would imply greater use of hydrogen and biomass in the transport and electricity sectors than the model suggests is optimal over the long-term leading to un-economical investments if taken forward. </p>

          <p>Taken together, the UKTM pathways evidence suggests that all the sixth carbon budget options are technically feasible and are consistent with a range of low-cost pathways to 2050, but the tightest option could lead to non-economical outcomes. The CCC recommended level (Option 3) is consistent with bringing forward electrification in heating and transport, and fuel switching in industry that the model suggests is needed long-term. The model chooses a smoother, slightly less costly, deployment trajectory of the same technology mix under the looser option (Option 2).</p>

          <p>In terms of the<b> fuel mix, </b>more frontloaded decarbonisation results in more rapid electrification and consequently electricity demand in 2035 is higher for the tighter sixth carbon budget options. The role of hydrogen in the sixth carbon budget period in the modelled UKTM scenarios is increasingly important. The main roles for hydrogen in the model during this period are to provide fuel switching in industry, fuel for heavy goods vehicles, ammonia production for shipping, and a potential low-carbon source of flexible electricity generation. In the high resource pathway this is augmented by increased hydrogen demand for heating buildings. </p>

          <p>More frontloaded decarbonisation increases the burden on the electricity and hydrogen sectors.  Detailed power sector modelling suggests that it is feasible to get to the grid intensity implied by the UKTM pathways, however the optimal mix of generating technologies will depend on their relative cost and availability. Without hydrogen generation for peaking demand, most core low-carbon generation technologies would have to deploy near their maximum technical potential. A further key area of uncertainty is energy from waste, which by 2035 is expected to make up a large share of power sector residual emissions. The availability of hydrogen generation can reduce the burden on other technologies, but the technical challenge remains significant. In all the pathways, apart from CCS delay, hydrogen supply in 2035 is predominantly from methane reformation with CCS, as BECCS technology is not assumed to deploy at scale until the mid-2030s, and electrolysis will not have scaled up by that time due to the cost of electrolysers and availability of renewables. This indicates that blue hydrogen is needed to provide scale in the short to medium term, before lower emissions technologies become available and cost-competitive at scale. </p>

        <content>
          <p>Across the sixth carbon budget options it is generally more cost-effective to deploy biomass in industry, hydrogen production and electricity generation than to use it for heating buildings and transport.  Balancing supply with demand considerations and avoiding sustainability issues will be an important consideration in policy development in this area. Under all carbon budget levels, the UKTM modelled least-cost technology mix includes more biofuels in aviation in 2035 than in 2050. This is only one illustrative view of the emissions pathway for aviation. For example, synthetic fuels, not modelled due to lack of robust data on the implications for the energy system, could be an alternative fuel source in the transition if they prove to be cost-effective.</p>

          <p>To establish the implications of higher/lower than expected <b>economic growth</b> on the core pathways, UKTM has also been run with two additional economic growth scenarios that model a +/-0.25 percentage point per year uncertainty range around the OBR’s July 2020 short-term upside and downside scenarios and the March 2020 long-term forecasts. The overall sensitivity implies a +10% or -9% increase or decrease in the level of GDP by 2035. These scenarios include no structural changes in the UK economy, but it should be acknowledged that structural changes could also affect UK emissions, particularly in sectors subject to high levels of global competition, e.g. industry.</p>

          <p>Generally, higher economic growth scenarios lead to higher decarbonisation costs, due to the additional infrastructure needed to meet higher energy demands over the transition and some more expensive technologies in the long run. There is a significant impact on supply side sectors due to the need to meet higher levels of demand and fuel switching (e.g. demand for clean electricity in 2050 is 20% higher in 2050). The reverse applies to lower growth scenarios. </p>

          <p>To test the implications of higher and lower <b>fossil fuel prices</b> the core pathways were also run with BEIS’s 2019 high and low fossil fuel price assumptions.<authorialNote marker="43"><p> BEIS 2019 Fossil fuel price assumptions. https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/fossil-fuel-price-assumptions-2019</p></authorialNote> Lower fossil fuel prices lead to higher overall energy demand and moderately higher decarbonisation costs, because the value of fossil fuel use savings are reduced. Conversely, higher fossil fuel prices lead to lower demand and decarbonisation costs because the resource savings from switching away from fossil fuels are higher. The impact on the share of emissions across end-use sectors and the technology mix is more variable than under central fossil fuel prices for all carbon budget levels. This highlights the importance of fossil fuel price assumptions for the consideration of the cost-effective pathway (e.g. transport emissions under low fossil fuel prices are higher due to a reduction in the cost-effectiveness of fuel switching and higher underlying transport demand).  </p>

          <p>In summary, the UKTM pathways evidence suggests that all the sixth carbon budget options are technically feasible, and Options 2-4 are consistent with a range of least-cost outcomes in 2050. All options apart from the do-nothing option (Option 1) meet the net zero target. Analysis suggests that tighter budget levels are more stretching across all sectors and that Option 4 (the tightest option) could lead to non-economical outcomes. </p>

          <p>The UKTM model addresses the technical feasibility of reaching the sixth carbon budget levels but does not consider non-technical barriers to policy delivery. This Impact Assessment is policy agnostic and therefore does not analyse barriers to specific policies that may be required to deliver the carbon budgets. Instead, this section presents a qualitative and illustrative discussion of some of the expected barriers in each sector. </p>

          <p>This section mainly considers the delivery implications of the sixth carbon budget, but it is also the case that the level of the sixth carbon budget will influence the deliverability of the 2050 net zero target. Whilst all the modelled budget options apart from the do-nothing option meet net zero, successful delivery of a tighter sixth carbon budget level would help de-risk the net zero target compared to a looser option. </p>

          <p>Since the policies required to meet the sixth carbon budget levels are as yet undecided, it is not possible to analyse the difference in the level of barriers of the sixth carbon budget levels considered in this Impact Assessment. However, it is expected that the marginal policies used to meet tighter sixth carbon budget levels will be more challenging. </p>

          <p>Across the considered sixth carbon budget levels, except the do-nothing option, all sectors will need to pursue policies that have some barriers to delivery. Consumers and producers will have to change the technologies they interact with and use, and in many cases the up-front costs of low carbon technologies, such as heat pumps, are currently higher than the technologies they replace. Supply chains for low carbon technologies will need to be significantly scaled up and, in some cases, key technologies will need to be demonstrated ahead of their wider-scale deployment. In almost all cases, widespread government intervention will be needed to overcome these barriers. </p>

          <p>In the <b>agricultural sector, </b>there are significant behavioural barriers. Most technical abatement options (such as installation of drainage systems, integrating grass and herbal leys, slurry covers) involve significant upfront costs, while installing and using the technologies is potentially disruptive for farmers. However, the main technologies do not require significant development, and supply chain issues are not expected. Where policy options involve land management change, there will be trade-offs and competition with other competing demands on land use.</p>

          <p>In the <b>buildings sector </b>there are significant barriers of all types. Emissions abatement requires a significant proportion of homeowners, tenants, landlords, businesses and the public sector to install and use low-carbon heating systems as they replace existing fossil fuel heating systems. Higher building fabric costs, disruption and awareness are all issues. Though most of the technology options are known, supply chains for key technologies, such as heat pumps, will need to be significantly ramped up to meet needs. Workforce constraints will be an issue without intervention. A hydrogen scenario for buildings decarbonisation would present different and significant barriers; research and development is required to guarantee safety and feasibility, and large scale infrastructure build and new regulation would be needed to create new markets at the necessary scale.</p>

          <p>In the <b>power sector</b>, high levels of government intervention and legislation will be required. The supply chains and skilled workforces to support them will need to be significantly scaled up on existing levels, which will require government incentives. Most of the required technology is mature, but there are some areas, such as energy storage, hydrogen generation and flexibility technology, that need development and innovation. Frontloading electrification and a higher level of ambition in the power sector increases the burden on the power sector. This level of ambition will impact costs; faster progress now may put us onto a pathway to a more expensive electricity system in 2050, due to the mix of technologies that it is possible to deploy quickly. The sixth carbon budget will also impact the level of low carbon build, with increases likely to be required across all key low carbon technologies. This will create a significant delivery risk. The increased ambition required under the sixth carbon budget must also be achieved whilst maintaining high levels of security of supply, given that electricity is a necessity in a modern industrial economy and key to decarbonising other sectors. Such a high build rate of low carbon technologies could create capacity adequacy and system operability issues that will need to be overcome. </p>

          <p>In the <b>land use sector</b>, there are significant barriers of all types. Afforestation and peatland restoration will require significant behaviour and culture changes by farmers and landowners, for which there is little financial incentive without government intervention. The need to take peatland out of agricultural production may face public opposition. Most necessary technology is mature, but lowland peat restoration will require innovation. Availability of scarce land is a significant barrier to afforestation and peat restoration, given competing land needs. Infrastructure and workforces for peat restoration will need to be scaled up. Overall, the delivery risk in the land use sector should not be underestimated given that the likely needed planting rates for afforestation and biomass for all sixth carbon budget levels are nearly an order of magnitude greater than current rates and, in the main, require incentives/regulations to facilitate planting on private land (i.e. land that government is not in control of). Furthermore, such an acceleration is likely to require significant trade-offs with water availability, landscape and biodiversity. For afforestation, the abatement profile and maximum level is dependent on the nature of the woodland planted and method of establishment; as a consequence, there are likely to be trade-offs between carbon abatement and nature recovery commitments made in the 25 Year Plan for the Environment.  </p>

          <p>In the <b>waste sector</b>, there are some barriers, particularly relating to changes in behaviour. Engagement and adoption of new behaviours will be required from producers, local authorities and consumers as packaging is improved and reduced and waste collection is improved by ensuring a consistent set of dry recyclable materials is collected from all households and businesses and offering weekly food waste collections. Additional market capacity may be needed, and some government intervention is likely required. </p>

          <p>In the <b>transport sector</b>, there are major barriers of all types. Encouraging take up of electric vehicles is a major challenge, with particular difficulties around current higher vehicle costs, and charging practice and times. Most car and van technologies are mature, whilst many alternative technologies for HGVs, hydrogen trains, advanced biofuels, sustainable aviation fuels and low-carbon shipping are in development or need to be demonstrated before they can be deployed at scale. Significant cost reductions and / or government intervention will be required to enable widespread deployment of these technologies, and achieve any necessary behaviour change by businesses and consumers. Production will need to scale up very significantly, especially for charging infrastructure, alternative fuel infrastructure and batteries, with the latter depending on scarce resources. For biofuel solutions, competition for land use and biomass feedstocks could be challenging. Regulatory measures are expected to be needed.</p>

Consumers and producers will need to shift towards lower carbon intensity, for which carbon pricing or other financial incentives will be needed. Markets need to be scaled up and workforce upskilling or retraining may be required. Where fuel switching to hydrogen is expected, significant infrastructure and supply chain development will be necessary for widespread take-up.</p>

          <p>There are also significant barriers to <b>hydrogen supply</b>, distribution, storage and use. Low carbon hydrogen production and end-use technologies have not been demonstrated at scale in a commercial setting, and hydrogen is more expensive than existing fossil fuel technologies in most end-use sectors. Widespread use of hydrogen will require hydrogen distribution and storage infrastructure to be built, and CCUS-enabled hydrogen production will also depend on the development of CO2 transport and storage networks. A new regulated market for hydrogen will also need to be established. Uptake of hydrogen would require sustainable behaviour adoption across end-use sectors, where users will have to change from fossil fuel to hydrogen appliances.</p>

          <p>The UK was previously included in the EU’s joint intended NDC under the Paris Agreement. In December 2020 the UK submitted its own economy wide NDC which commits to reducing GHG emissions by at least 68% (excluding IAS emissions) by 2030 on 1990 levels. The level of the NDC is consistent with advice from the CCC and the UK’s commitment to reach net zero emissions by 2050. The CCC has stated that an NDC of at least 68% ‘would constitute a decisive commitment to a net zero emissions trajectory, consistent with the Paris Agreement’, which ‘would place the UK among the leading countries in climate ambition.’ In line with common NDC practice, the UK’s NDC target does not include international aviation and shipping. All options under consideration in this assessment assume this target is met, except for the counterfactual scenario.</p>

          <p>All other factors being equal, global emissions pathways associated with lower global temperature rises tend to imply faster emissions reductions and earlier timings of global net zero. That is, 1.5°C pathways generally require faster and deeper action than well below 2°C pathways. For instance, the IPCC SR1.5 concludes that in model pathways that limit global warming to 1.5°C with no or limited overshoot, global CO2 emissions decline by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030 (40-60% interquartile range), reaching global net zero around 2050 (2045-2055 interquartile range); in pathways that limit global warming to well below 2°C, global CO2 emissions decline by about 25% from 2010 levels by 2030 (10-30% interquartile range) and reach global net zero around 2070 (2065-2080 interquartile range). It is also worth noting that the assessment models used to derive these pathways tend to be global cost-optimisation models, suggesting that early action (or frontloaded) pathways tend to be more cost-effective at a global level than delayed action (or backloaded pathways).</p>

          <p>Current international commitments under the Paris Agreement (i.e. aggregate Nationally Determined Contributions) do not put the world on track to meet the Paris temperature goals. According to the UNEP Emissions Gap Report 2020, current aggregate NDCs as of November 2020 would lead to a temperature increase of at least 3°C by the end of the century, signalling the need for a significant step-up in climate change mitigation ambition if the Paris temperature goal is to remain within reach. The report estimates a global emissions gap in 2030 of 12-29GtCO2e between the more ambitious end of current aggregate NDCs and Paris-compatible emissions scenarios. The UNFCCC’s Interim NDC Synthesis Report found limited progress on NDC ambition from updated NDCs submitted up to the end of 2020.</p>

          <p>There is no single internationally accepted standard methodology for measuring or assessing whether a country’s emissions reduction target represents an appropriate contribution towards the Paris temperature goal. This Impact Assessment therefore investigates a range of potential interpretations by considering the following dimensions:</p>

          <p>This section compares emissions implied by the different sixth carbon budget options with the average reductions required by the world as a whole to meet the Paris temperature goal. This is one of the approaches that was used by the CCC as the basis for their recommendation of a 2050 UK net zero target, which was adopted by Parliament in 2019. The approach was also complemented and expanded in the CCC’s advice on the sixth carbon budget level and UK NDC. The CCC suggests that the recommended budget level is “broadly aligned to global pathways for the Paris Agreement, including the 1.5°C goal” and that “any slower reductions to 2035 would bring into question whether the UK could be credibly considered to be pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C”.</p>

          <p>Apart from ‘do nothing’, all options deliver emission reductions on a per capita basis that, if followed globally, would be consistent with the global ambition to keep the increase in global average temperature in line with the Paris Agreement temperature goal. Relative to Option 2, Options 3 and 4 would fare more favourably from a global climate leadership perspective by delivering faster emission reductions, resulting in lower cumulative emissions to 2050 and in emissions per capita levels in 2035 that are marginally closer to the upper end of the 1.5°C ambition. Although there is uncertainty, the different trajectories lead to different outcomes, and looser pathways, all else being equal, will lead to higher global temperature, higher risks of extreme events or require a risky greater reliance on GHG removal technologies in the long-term to meet the Paris Agreement’s temperature goal.</p>

          <p>This section includes an assessment of what UK action could be considered cost-effective, fair and equitable under different global warming scenarios and interpretations of how to allocate effort shares in global emissions reductions. A cost-effective allocation scenario assumes that global emission abatement costs are minimised at any point in time given a global emissions target and derives what could be considered an economically efficient UK share of global emissions reduction efforts. Equity-based allocations instead consider other factors, such as differing levels of economic development and historical emissions between countries.</p>

          <p>Effort-sharing approaches can be used to frame domestic emission reduction levels in the context of global climate action but should not be interpreted as providing a firm indication of what that level should be. There is no internationally agreed methodology to derive a country’s equitable or fair contribution towards mitigating climate change. The results of equity-based allocations will depend on value judgements about the relevant importance of different fairness principles. Similarly, a purely cost-effective effort allocation does not differentiate between countries’ national circumstances.</p>

          <p>Moreover, effort-share approaches narrowly focus on different ways of allocating a global mitigation burden amongst countries and fail to capture other important wider economic and equity considerations. For instance, they do not capture the extent of potential damages of climate change impacts, which are likely to vary significantly across countries. They also fail to capture any potential wider economic opportunities and benefits from net zero transitions, including the potential for development of low-carbon jobs, technological innovations and relative competitive advantages or co-benefits to health from mitigation.</p>

          <p>Effort-share analysis considers only domestic abatement. When framing domestic action in the context of global climate change mitigation efforts, it is also important to note that the potential for the development of global carbon markets under the Paris Agreement cooperation frameworks and the provision of international climate finance provide further instruments for coordinating global action beyond domestic emission reduction targets. In addition to domestic emission reduction commitments, the UK is also currently supporting low carbon growth in developing countries. The UK’s International Climate Finance (ICF) helps developing countries mitigate and adapt to the impacts of climate change, reduce deforestation and pursue clean economic growth. At the United Nations Climate Action Summit, the Prime Minister committed to double the UK’s ICF to at least £11.6bn between 2021 and 2025. This represents a doubling of the UK’s commitment to spend at least £5.8 billion on tackling climate change from 2016 to 2020. </p>

          <p>The percentage reductions for the sixth carbon budget options presented above (e.g. table 4) cannot be compared to the percentage reductions in table 13, as they are based on different accounting assumptions. For example, when put on a comparable basis, Option 3 for the sixth carbon budget level implies a reduction of c. 84% on 1990 levels on the same accounting basis as table 13. After adjusting for those accounting differences, in 2035, modelled sixth carbon budget options imply emission reductions that are more ambitious than if global mitigation efforts were shared across countries/regions in the most cost-effective way. They are less ambitious than if efforts were shared with historical contributions to emissions taken into account. They are within the range of reductions implied by effort allocations based on forward looking convergence on common emissions performance metrics.</p>

          <p>It is worth noting that the analysis implicitly assumes that the global emissions abatement target will be met under each effort-sharing approach only if all countries adhere to the same effort-sharing allocation. Also, the metrics do not necessarily imply emission reductions that are consistent with the UK’s long-term net zero target. These equity approaches therefore provide a guide for what an appropriate contribution from the UK would be to the global emission reduction, not all of which should necessarily be delivered through domestic emissions cuts.</p>

          <p>Alongside these commitments, countries have been encouraged to come forward with more ambitious NDCs ahead of COP26, as required by the Paris Agreement. Whilst NDCs required ahead of COP26 propose emissions reduction targets for 2030 and so are not directly comparable to the years covered by the sixth carbon budget, they present a benchmark for international comparison of climate ambition and commitments. Countries will be required to bring forward commitments covering the period after 2030 by 2025. Despite NDCs becoming increasingly transparent, it is difficult to directly compare targets between different countries due to national circumstances. Uncertainties remain over the sectors and gases that targets cover as well as differences in the accounting rules for LULUCF emissions. Countries can also report NDCs using different metrics and base-years. The table below summarises the emissions reduction targets adopted by the G20 countries.</p>

          <p>In summary, the analysis shows that Option 1, the do-nothing option, is not consistent with the UK’s overall international climate change ambition. All options apart from ‘do nothing’ deliver emission reductions on a per capita basis that, if followed globally, would be consistent with the ambitions of the Paris Agreement. Relative to option 2, options 3 and 4 would fare more favourably from a global climate leadership perspective by delivering faster emission reductions and resulting in lower cumulative emissions to 2050.</p>

          <p>The baseline is based on emissions projections as outlined in paragraph 33 and does not meet the 2030 NDC or 2050 Net Zero target, both of which act as constraints on emissions separately from the sixth carbon budget decision. Hence, not all costs and benefits presented in this section are additional to current government ambition or policy plans. However, the relative difference in cost and benefits between the different sixth carbon budget options are not impacted by this.</p>

Costs of hassle and disruption associated with the transition are not included. Some power sector costs are taken from the BEIS Dynamic Dispatch Model (DDM) and Distribution Network Model (DNM), which provides a more sophisticated cost estimate of the power sector than UKTM.</p>

High carbon values have been used (similar to the CCC’s analysis) with the existing central value tested as a sensitivity. This reflects the fact that the current central carbon values, which are under review and are set on a target consistent basis, are likely to undervalue greenhouse gas emissions given that they are consistent with the UK’s old decarbonisation target of 80% reduction in emissions by 2050. </p>

          <p>In addition to carbon savings, benefits covered include fuel savings and natural capital improvements such as air quality benefits. Air quality impacts are monetised in line with the national values of the most recently air quality damage costs. Natural capital costs and benefits are particularly uncertain as their impacts are local. Since the specific policies to meet the sixth carbon budget are not yet known this analysis only provides a general assessment. Costs and benefits are discounted according to Green Book guidance of 3.5% p.a. with air quality impacts subject to a lower 1.5% p.a. health discount rate. As a sensitivity, this lower discount rate is also applied to emissions savings.</p>

          <p>The appraisal period is 2020 to 2050, reflecting that achieving the sixth carbon budget depends on action taken in earlier carbon budget periods and, likewise, future carbon budgets will depend on action taken during the sixth carbon budget.  The appraisal period does not represent the full period over which there will be costs of mitigating emissions or benefits from the UK’s contribution to climate change mitigation. However, the analysis did not show that costs and benefits beyond 2050 would be significantly different across the sixth carbon budget level options.</p>

          <p>Table 15 shows the net present values of the sixth carbon budget options for each pathway. All net present values are significantly positive. The ordering of the pathways is common across budget levels, with high CCS the pathway with the highest NPV and CCS delay the pathway with the lowest. Of the technology assumptions analysed, results are most sensitive to changes in availability and efficiency of carbon capture and storage. </p>

          <p>This shows that the absolute impacts of the sixth carbon budget will depend on how the level is achieved. However, the relative impacts of the considered levels are not substantially impacted by the technology pathway. Therefore, the remaining analysis in this section focuses on the core pathway to illustrate the impacts of the different budget options, the main purpose of this Impact Assessment.</p>

          <p>Less ambitious sixth carbon budget levels have higher NPVs than more ambitious levels, indicating that the marginal cost of abatement is higher than the (high) carbon values. The differences between options are substantial in absolute terms, but smaller in relative terms: for example, the NPV for Option 2 is £23bn higher than Option 3 in the core pathway, but this is a difference of only 9%, with cost benefit ratios of 1.49 and 1.41 respectively.</p>

          <p>Table 16 shows the composition of the net present value across Options 2-4. The great majority of benefits are emissions savings benefits, with fuel savings, air quality improvements and other natural capital impacts constituting the remaining benefits. Annex A.5 provides a more detailed breakdown of the environmental impacts considered. Non-carbon benefits do not significantly differ between levels. </p>

          <p>The vast majority of costs are additional capital costs, illustrating that the transition to net zero is primarily capital intensive. This is the case across all sixth carbon budget options. For the CCC level, additional operational costs amount to under 5% of total additional costs. Significant fuel savings are expected, offsetting 20% of additional capital costs. </p>

          <p>In net cost terms and considering only the core pathway, accounting for capital costs, operational costs, and fuel savings, we estimate that the cost of meeting the CCC's recommended sixth carbon budget level will be equivalent to 1.6% of GDP in 2035. The comparable cost of meeting the Net Zero target would be 1.8% of GDP in 2050. This is within the envelope of 1-2% of GDP that has previously been estimated as the cost of meeting the UK's decarbonisation targets.</p>

          <p>The sensitivities shown above do not render any of the net present values negative, except that the tightest budget level (Option 4) has a negative NPV under the current central carbon value series. GDP growth and fuel prices have little impact on the relative NPVs of the three options, and change the NPVs by at most 19%. The positivity of NPVs is robust to optimism bias; in order for the net present value to be negative, additional system costs for the CCC level would have to rise by 41%.</p>

          <p>The carbon values used to quantify the benefits of emissions reductions, and the reduction of the environmental discount rate to 1.5% both have a significant impact on the differences between the NPVs of the three levels, as well as their absolute size. Using a lower carbon value series (i.e. the current central series) causes NPVs to fall very significantly (by 94% for the CCC level) and the difference between the CCC and looser levels increases by £13bn, to £36bn. This reflects that decreasing carbon values makes abatement relatively less valuable and thus ambitious budget levels less attractive. Carbon values would need to be 61% higher than current high series for the CCC level to replace the looser level as the option with the highest NPV.</p>

          <p>The environmental discount rate sensitivity removes the wealth element of the 3.5% discount rate for carbon savings by uplifting the carbon values by 2% annually. This reflects the potential insensitivity of the value placed on the environment to GDP growth, and results in future emissions reductions being valued at a higher rate. This significantly increases the magnitude of carbon benefits and reduces the difference between the CCC level (Option 3) and the looser level (Option 2) from £23bn to £7bn. The proportional difference between these two NPVs becomes very small, falling from 9% to 1%.</p>

          <p>The Climate Change Act requires that scientific knowledge be considered when setting carbon budgets. Climate science underpins the UK’s 2050 target to reach net zero emissions. This target was advised by the Climate Change Committee as an appropriate share of global action to reach the Paris Agreement goal of “holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels, pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to below 1.5°C”.  Aside from do nothing, all the sixth carbon budget options analysed here are consistent with IPCC estimates of the emissions reductions required to meet this target.</p>

          <p>However, there are large and persistent uncertainties around both the sensitivity of global temperatures to greenhouse gas emissions and the costs of adapting to varying temperature rises. These uncertainties tend to be greater in relation to higher levels of warming and greenhouse gas emissions, since we know less about global climates that are more dissimilar to todays. Worst case scenarios, in which global warming occurs quicker and with more consequences than we expect, are real and dangerous possibilities. Aversion to these tail risks, as well as the central projection, is a crucial pillar of the scientific argument for decarbonisation. Global emissions should therefore be reduced and stabilised at net zero as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p>Total greenhouse gas emissions over time determine the UK’s contribution to climate change. The levels of the sixth carbon budget that are analysed here imply only minor differences in future UK cumulative emissions which, because UK emissions are only a fraction of global emissions, means these differences have a very small impact on global emissions. However, given the potential impact of high UK climate ambition on other countries’ policies and climate ambition, especially in the context of the UK’s presidency at COP26 in 2021, more ambitious targets could meaningfully contribute to global efforts towards net zero (see section 2.4).</p>

These costs are highly uncertain and depend on the success with which global climate ambition is raised, emissions reductions are delivered and the UK is prepared for the impact of future climate change through, for example, using climate change risk assessments to inform infrastructure investment.</p>

          <p>The carbon values used in the appraisal in section 2.5 do not represent the social damage cost of carbon. Rather they are based on a target-consistent approach, using estimates of the abatement costs that will need to be incurred to meet specific emissions reduction targets. Thus, damage and adaptation costs are not directly considered. Due to the complexity of calculating costs of adaptation, a national assessment on adaptation costs in the UK does not exist. However, it is clear that the UK is already experiencing the impacts of climate change and the latest UK climate projections show an increased chance of warmer, wetter winters and hotter, drier summers along with an increase in the frequency and intensity of extremes<authorialNote marker="52"><p>50 https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/pub/data/weather/uk/ukcp18/science-reports/UKCP18-Overview-report.pdf</p></authorialNote>.</p>

          <p>Increased demand for decarbonisation technologies and policies that incentivise low-carbon innovation or penalise high-carbon technologies can foster innovation that increases domestic competitiveness and global comparative advantage for some UK industries, providing potential export opportunities. But there will also be risks to sectors and industries susceptible to competitiveness impacts, particularly those that are trade-exposed or carbon intensive. Where UK firms lose market share to international firms with lower environmental standards, there is a high risk of carbon leakage. There is little empirical evidence of this occurring in the UK as yet, but risks may increase as further policy is implemented. Vulnerable firms may include, for example, those for whom energy is a significant proportion of the cost base or a key differentiator in costs of production with competitors. Decarbonisation of these sectors could require additional investment which, in many cases can increase operating costs, though these costs can be offset at least in part by greater levels of energy efficiency.</p>

          <p>Historically, the UK’s approach to mitigating competitiveness impacts and carbon leakage risk has been through issuing free allowances under the EU ETS. This approach has been carried over to the UK ETS, and possible changes to free allowances are currently under review. BEIS also provides compensation to certain energy intensive industries for the indirect emission cost due to the UK ETS and some sectors receive a reduction in energy consumption tax via Climate Change Agreements. The eventual impact of decarbonisation on firms at risk will depend on future policy development, particularly relating to the UK ETS.</p>

          <p>The magnitude of competitiveness effects in international markets are dependent on global climate ambition as well as domestic policy. If the UK continues to have a world leading climate ambition, competitiveness effects may be larger. However, if other countries, particularly the UK’s trading partners, increase their industrial decarbonisation ambition in line with the UK’s, and face similar additional costs, then competitiveness effects will be smaller. Similarly, where the UK’s path to net zero creates export opportunities for UK businesses, the size of these will depend on the actions of the rest of the world. High global climate ambition will result in a large market for decarbonisation technologies but may also result in more global competition in those markets. </p>

          <p>The overall impact of the sixth carbon budget decision on households will depend on future policies.  However, compared to the do nothing option, decarbonisation would likely add upward pressure to electricity prices and heating costs, but lower transport fuel costs (reflecting the greater efficiency of EVs) based on current market and policy structures. Future transport and heating costs, if electric, may form a significant part of a household’s electricity bill. These have not been considered in detail below due to a lack of certainty in the supporting policy framework. Precise bill impacts for individual households will also depend on several additional factors including consumer characteristics, fuel choices and policy eligibility.</p>

          <p>Over the sixth carbon budget period retail electricity prices are generally higher for the CCC’s recommended budget option compared to the baseline. An increase in Contracts for Difference (CfD) support costs and transmission costs linked to increased renewable deployment largely drives higher retail prices. Lower wholesale prices due to higher renewable generation slightly offsets this increase. However, the increase in household retail electricity prices is less than 5% for most pathways.</p>

Aligned with the scope of this Impact Assessment set out in section 1.4, the emissions intensity of the UK economy in 1990, as measured through territorial emissions was 683tCO2e/GDP£2019m, with an energy intensity as measured through final energy demand of 1333MWh/GDP£2019m. In comparison, the emission and final energy intensity of the UK economy is forecasted to be around 146tCO2e/£GDP2019m and 545MWh/GDP£2019m respectively in 2035, in the do-nothing baseline. </p>

          <p>The precise impact of the sixth carbon budget level on each of these elements will depend on what energy policies are implemented as a result of the carbon budget level. However as highlighted in section 2.3, delivering any level of the sixth carbon budget will require a substantial increase in electrification (which rises for tighter sixth carbon options) and the simultaneous deep decarbonisation of electricity supply which carry their own security of supply risks and system operability issues. Electrification, along with other measures considered as part of the technology mix, has the potential to reduce demand for gas, coal, oil and transport fuels which could improve security of supply by diversifying away from primarily imported fossil fuels. </p>

          <p>There are likely to be significant positive and negative impacts to natural capital from meeting each of the sixth carbon budget options. Impacts will largely be determined by the specific policies chosen to meet the sixth carbon budget level and may be localised or time bound. In-depth exploration of the natural capital impacts of specific policies and policy mixes for the sixth carbon budget will need to be undertaken to ensure trade-offs are managed and impacts mitigated. The following paragraphs summarise likely impacts for each natural capital pillar. Further details are found in Annex A.5.</p>

          <p><b>Land Use trade-offs</b>: the rapid and unprecedented rate of land use change resulting from implementation of the more stringent afforestation and biomass scenarios (up to 103 kha/yr) represents a high risk to natural capital. It is likely that there would need to be trade-offs impacting food production, biodiversity, landscape and water resources to accelerate to and maintain such levels of land use change. Given that local community objection to planting schemes is already common, acceleration on this scale would also be expected to meet negative public reaction.</p>

          <p>Recommending a budget level for the sixth carbon budget requires the consideration of all five assessment criteria in the round, including taking into account specific factors set out in the Climate Change Act, as well as the advice of the Committee on Climate Change and the representations of the Devolved Administrations.</p>

          <p>Considering all assessment criteria in the round, including specific factors set out in the Climate Change Act, the proposed option for the sixth carbon budget level is 965MtCO2e, Option 3. This option is the recommended level by the CCC and the preferred option of the Devolved Administrations. The high level of ambition supports the overall policy objective of mitigating the potentially catastrophic effects of climate change, while the more ambitious Option 4 could lead to non-economical outcomes. Option 3 is more challenging than Option 2 from a technical feasibility and delivery perspective, but the analysis shows it is technically feasible to achieve and has a strongly positive NPV. Option 3 is also in line with an ambitious contribution to global efforts towards meeting the Paris Agreement temperature goal and strengthens the UK position in pushing for higher ambition from other countries. Whilst the costs of this option are higher and the NPV is smaller than those of Option 2, these relative differences are within the uncertainty ranges and in the whole outweighed by the other assessment criteria.  </p>

            <p>The model only takes account of a subset of the full costs and benefits of meeting a given carbon budget level.  In addition, only technical factors are taken into account in the roll out choices (costs, maximum build rates etc.).  Behavioural or other practical considerations that might make certain pathways undesirable or difficult to achieve are not accounted for. In addition, the modelled solution will delay roll out of the more expensive options required for as long as is technically possible, given the assumed maximum deployment rate and overarching emissions constraint. This result is due to the discounting of future costs and because costs are then incurred for a shorter time period, as the modelling ends in 2060. </p>

            <p>The results for each run of the model take no account of risk or uncertainty. The pathways modelled by UKTM are therefore only least-cost and achievable if all of the underpinning assumptions turn out to be correct over the whole period. It is unlikely in practice that all technologies would achieve the costs and performance assumed and that the availability and maximum build rate assumptions could all be achieved. This aspect also contributes to the model delaying the roll out of more expensive options, as it does not factor in the risk that some of these options may not be fully viable, and the impact this could have on achieving the UK’s 2050 emissions target. </p>

            <p>The level of detail in UKTM varies across different sectors and, as with any model, is a simplified representation of the real world.  Because it does not fully reflect the diversity in technology options and user choices it may understate the diversity of technologies that could contribute to achieving meeting targets at least-cost. UKTM does not include behavioural measures, such as transport modal shifts or increased household recycling.   </p>

          <num>•</num>
          <content>
            <p>Sectors where the majority of emissions are not related to energy use, such as agriculture, are modelled in less detail in UKTM than in sector-specific models. Other sectors are generally more granular in UKTM in terms of the number of technology options but less detailed in terms of the factors that affect variation in costs.  For instance, UKTM takes no account of variation in heat network costs due to geospatial factors, instead applying an average cost per unit of capacity.  Competition for use of land, including diverting it from other uses such as agriculture, is also likely to be an issue in the higher biomass availability scenarios but these interactions are not taken into account within UKTM. It is important to note that UKTM does not price risk, or directly factor in uncertainty.  Therefore, each solution that UKTM finds is dependent on every assumption about each technology (e.g., cost, maximum build rate, maximum availability) coming true. UKTM effectively states the latest decision points to start mitigation actions, in a deterministic world under perfect foresight. </p>

          <p>Analysis of effort sharing of global emissions reductions has been conducted using BEIS Global Carbon Finance model – GLOCAF. The model allows the user to evaluate the impacts of different global emission reduction targets, burden sharing regimes, as well as various specifications of the carbon market design. It covers the years 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040 and 2050.</p>

          <p>At the heart of GLOCAF is a model of global carbon markets. It compares the supply of carbon abatement or International Carbon Units (driven largely by MAC curves) to the demand for mitigation, (determined by the difference between BAU and regional targets). The model finds the market clearing carbon price where the demand for carbon permits matches their supply for each market. This is done through an iterative process around the carbon price. These curves are constrained by trade restrictions around, for example, supplementarily (the requirement for a certain part of a target to be met domestically) and/or participation.</p>

Predicting exactly how land use will change in order to meet future demands for food, energy, resources, housing, recreation, biodiversity, waste, nature and emissions abatement, is challenging even where policy levers are established.

          <p>Such levels of land use change could impact how we produce our food, urban developments and nature, with knock-on effects for other land use types and agriculture. Land use will be under pressure for conversion to lower carbon land uses and management regimes. For example, there are competing demands for different types of natural carbon dioxide removal technologies such as tree planting, biomass or peatland restoration. This will involve trade-offs between different grades of land, conversion to other uses, and environmental values such as biodiversity and landscapes, in order to meet population needs and targets.</p>

Demand for land use change may have negative impacts on access to green space, recreation and amenity value, and therefore mitigating actions and trade-offs should be considered when determining the suite of policies for reaching the sixth carbon budget.

Overall, achieving the sixth carbon budget will reduce emissions of several air pollutants as climate change and air pollution are strongly related and have many of the same contributing emission sources. The sixth carbon budget will have impacts in areas such as transport, buildings (related to energy efficiency measures, heat pumps etc.), and switching from fossil fuel combustion to wind and solar power will significantly reduce emissions of NOx, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), NMVOCs and SO2.</p>

            <p>Ammonia emission from the production of biogas and biomethane using anaerobic digestion. Reducing ammonia emissions is a priority because it is detrimental to ecosystems, reduces biodiversity and impacts peatlands’ ability to store carbon; when in the atmosphere, it can deposit more nitrogen onto soils, plants and freshwaters than they can cope with, as well as impacting human health by contributing to the formation of fine particulate matter. It will also result in significant irreversible biodiversity declines in particular ecosystems. Therefore, mitigating technology to reduce emissions is necessary, at any level of the sixth carbon budget that relies on anaerobic digestion plants, in order to meet the UK’s legally binding ammonia reduction target for 2030. Mitigation technology will also help achieve CC targets, as well as biodiversity targets set out in the 25 Year Environment Plan and the Leader’s Pledge for Nature.</p>

          <p>Ongoing consideration of the potential impacts of air pollutants at a local scale is needed. While overall emissions reductions is an overall indicator of progress in air quality, it is not an effective indicator in reducing the impacts of pollution which are influenced by the local concentrations of pollution in closer proximity to sensitive ecosystems or centres of population. Although modelling suggests that in the main, with the exceptions cited above, air pollutant emissions will be lower at a national scale, it is possible that place-based hotspots of ammonia, particulates or the secondary pollutant ozone could be inadvertently generated. If more localised concentration increases of these pollutants occurs, this will result in unintended human health, ecosystem, and therefore economic impacts.</p>

          <p>Whilst many policies reduce water demand, some low carbon technologies are water-intensive and large-scale implementation could mean unsustainable demand. For example, nuclear power, CCS and hydrogen production require high levels of water input for cooling and electrolysis respectively. Further, although land management and some productivity options are likely to have positive impacts on water quality by reducing nutrient leaching and sedimentation through reduced soil erosion, overall intensification of agricultural production is likely to create additional water quality and usage pressures, including for the marine environment. Furthermore, the impact, in many cases local, of the proposed afforestation/biomass planting rates on water resources/availability needs to be noted, given the higher water use of trees, particularly fast-growing and productive woodland, over other land covers. Additionally, innovative options such as Anaerobic Digestion can have negative impacts on water quality if not handled carefully, particularly through the increase of nutrients on the overall available land bank.</p>

          <p>The Welsh Government view is that the UK’s sixth carbon budget should be set at the level recommended by the CCC (Option 3), considering it an important part of being consistent with Wales’s proposed new targets and carbon budgets, while noting the influence the UK can have internationally as it hosts COP26.</p>

          <p>Wales supports the CCC position on carbon accounting, most notably the inclusion of IAS emissions, in line with the approach already taken in Wales. It is also of the view that the fifth carbon budget should be reset in law to align with the CCC’s recommended pathway to net zero in 2050, and the NDC level in 2030.</p>

It is considering advice from CCC on what would be considered Northern Ireland’s fair and equitable contribution to achieving UK net zero, which will guide the development of future climate change legislation.</p>
