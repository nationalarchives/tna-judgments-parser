The problem under consideration is the need to raise fees to cover costs. In addition, the fees need to be set in such a way as to comply with "Managing Public Money" principles.  Government intervention is the only means available for raising income for the Insolvency Service, if this it not possible the deficit would continue to be funded by the Department of Business, Innovation and Skills and ultimately by taxpayers. </p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">(0) Do nothing – The insolvency fees in the next financial year would remain unchanged. Even allowing for continued efforts of cost reduction, with current caseload levels and the anticipated decline in future case numbers, the gap between case administration fees and the cost of carrying out official receiver work would mean that deficits would persist.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">Option 1 is the preferred option.

          <p>The costs of administering bankruptcies and compulsory liquidations are recouped from deposits payable to enter the insolvency process and charges against assets realised in insolvency cases. The Insolvency Service is has been incurring operational deficits due to continuing falls in the number of individuals entering bankruptcy and companies going into compulsory liquidation. Although the Insolvency Service continues to reduce costs, for example a reduction in staff costs of £32m and estate costs of £5m between 2010/11 and 2014/15, falling case numbers mean there is a higher share of fixed costs per case, which cannot be easily or quickly remedied. Even with ongoing programmes to reduce estates and staff costs, the steep fall in case numbers means there remains a deficit, which is funded by BIS/the taxpayers.  </p>

          <p>The Enterprise Act 2002 modernised the financial regime of the Insolvency Service by simplifying the fee structure and ensuring increased transparency and was preceded by an extensive consultation exercise. A Regulatory Impact Assessment was prepared for the Enterprise Act 2002. The changes proposed by this instrument are designed to maintain the principles of the financial regime introduced by the principal Order of the Act and in particular, that fees are set to match cost. Therefore no public consultation is proposed in respect of these fees increases. These changes are only to take place in England and Wales.</p>

          <p>The number of bankruptcy cases has reduced significantly in the last few years. In 2008 there were 67,428 bankruptcy cases, and by 2014 the number had reduced to 20,322. Numbers are still falling. Overhead and staffing reductions have not been able to keep pace with the steep decline in case load resulting in a higher fixed cost per insolvency case. The Insolvency Service has significantly reduced costs,<b> </b>and continues to do so through a portfolio of projects that have delivered, at 31 March 2014, total savings realised of £7.1m compared to 2011–12 baseline data. However there still remains an operational deficit which will persist if no action is taken. There is a need for increases to certain insolvency charges to better balance costs and fees, which will work alongside the Insolvency Service’s efficiency plans, to prevent a deficit in 2016/17</p>

          <p>At present, after the petition deposit is paid, the cost of administering the case (the administration fee) fee is recovered from assets realised by the Official Receiver, with any surplus funds being distributed to creditors. But it is often the case that there are insufficient assets to cover the administration fee. Indeed analysis of Insolvency Service case data indicates that around 50 per cent of cases do not have any assets from which a payment toward the administration fee can be made. Where there are insufficient or no assets, the administration costs are covered by a separate Secretary of State (SOS) fee, charged on those cases with sufficiently high asset levels. This means that there is cross-subsidisation between insolvency cases to cover costs. </p>

          <p>The economic rationale for government intervention in insolvency and bankruptcy cases is that it is necessary to ensure a collective approach is taken by creditors when dealing with those companies in financial distress in response to the ‘prisoner’s dilemma’ faced by creditors. That is, in the event of a default, each creditor will have the incentive to be the first one to collect the assets of the insolvent. This approach will force the debtors to sell the assets piece by piece in order to pay each creditor in turn. However, creditors collectively might be able to get more if they took a coordinated strategy to divide and sell the assets or re negotiate loans and debts. </p>

          <p>Managing the insolvency process comes at a cost, both to the courts<authorialNote marker="3"><p> Debtors petition cases are due to become an administrative rather than a court based procedure in April 2016</p></authorialNote> from making bankruptcy and insolvency orders and to official receivers from dealing with cases. These costs should normally be covered by creditors who are the direct beneficiaries from the overall coordinated insolvency process, and HM Treasury rules set out in Managing Public Money, require fees to be set to cover costs. However the operational deficit in official receiver cases means this is not the case at present and that the tax payer is subsidising the cost for creditors. Government intervention is necessary to restore the balance of payments from the tax payer to creditors. </p>

          <p>The Secretary of State Fee is a cost recovery mechanism that is charged on bankruptcy and compulsory liquidation cases with significant assets. A proportional amount of the assets realised within different bands is taken as a fee up to a cap of £80,000. The fee is designed to subsidise the cost of other cases where the realised assets were insufficient to meet the administration costs of the case. The current bands were introduced for Insolvency Orders made after 6 April 2010. </p>

The appraisal period for this policy is 10 years but no forecasts are available on the level of income after 2016/17 so the £1.4m increase in 2016/17 has been projected to remain flat for the remainder of the appraisal.

          <p>The new SOS fee bands will reduce the money taken by the Insolvency Service from cases where the costs of administering them are fully cost recovered. Cases with relatively small levels of assets will receive the greatest benefit with more assets paid to creditors. Analysis of administrative data held by the Insolvency Service estimates that when taken the average SOS fee is around £1,450 and that following the changes to the fee banding creditors will benefit by between £2 and £3m less being taken in fee payments. The increased returns to creditors are an economic transfer from the insolvency service to creditors.</p>

          <p>The higher deposits will cost bankruptcy creditors around £0.26m per year. HMRC is the largest single creditor in many insolvencies, the impact upon this Department is included as part of the costs upon creditors. Internal Insolvency Service statistics<authorialNote marker="8"><p> Insolvency Service statisticians analysis of Insolvency data</p></authorialNote>  show that HMRC is a petitioning creditor in 40 per cent of bankruptcy cases, this would mean HMRC paying an additional £75 in creditor bankruptcy cases or £0.11m per year in additional costs to petition. Around a further 5 – 10% of cases come from local authorities who based on forecasted case load would have to pay an additional £0.01 to £0.03m. </p>

          <p>A company petition can be initiated by creditors, directors or the company itself so the extra cost of the petition will be shared amongst these petitioners. Creditors account for the majority of other petitions with companies and directors on their own account, accounting for less than 5 per cent. Therefore the cost to creditors from higher company petition deposits is likely to be £0.24m. Of this HMRC is the petitioner in the majority of cases (around 56 per cent) meaning they will incur an additional cost of approximately £0.13m. </p>

After accounting for companies and directors on their own account petitioners, based on current forecasts it will cost creditors an additional £0.5m creditor bankruptcy petitions and company winding up petitions, while creditors are likely to be paying between £2 and £3m less in SOS fee payments. </p>

        <intro>
          <p>Reducing the cross subsidisation requires that the cost per case be reflected in the fee charged. The significant number of cases with zero assets means that to cover the costs of administering these cases more payment is required to initiate proceedings. The Insolvency Service is taking three steps to reduce the cross subsidisation of official receiver cases:</p>

          <p>The payment of the deposit is deducted from the cost of the administration fee so even cases with no assets to realise will pay more towards the cost of administering the case.

          <p>The greater increase in deposits versus the administration fee means a greater share of the cost of administering cases is paid at the commencement of a case and a reduced need to rely on asset realisation from the estate to pay the remaining administration fee. This reduction in cross subsidisation is shown in Table 8.</p>

The average SOS fee from across company and bankruptcy cases is estimated to be £1,450<authorialNote marker="9"><p> Based on 2010/11 asset realisations </p></authorialNote>. Following the changes to banding and using the current caseload forecasts it is estimated that the average SOS fee will decrease to £1,328. The lower level of the fee means more of the income required by the Insolvency Service to administer the cases would be coming from each case and not relying as heavily on cases with significant assets to cross subsidise those with minimal or no assets.</p>

          <p>Creditors and others may be unwilling to pay the increased costs to petition individuals for bankruptcy or to put companies into compulsory liquidation. Evidence from recent fee changes (Annex A) shows that there may be a weak relationship between fee changes and case numbers, meaning cases may drop by more than forecasted due to the increase in petitioning costs. But we do not believe this effect will be large due to pre-existing trends having the bigger impact on case numbers.</p>

This is only an estimate and the numbers could rise or fall. There is a fixed cost element to the activity of the Insolvency Service, so if there are a significantly fewer cases there may have to be a proportionally higher increase in fees, spread across the fewer number of cases.

          <p>The changes to fees and deposits are not the result of any change in regulatory scope and are the result of lower case numbers leading to higher fixed cost per case. The changes to the SOS are required to reduce the cross subsidisation of cases and ensure compliance with Managing Public Money principles. The changes will result in a net benefit to creditors as the cost of increased deposits will be less than the assets returned to creditors via reduction in the SOS banding. In accordance with the Better Regulation Framework, these measures are not within scope of one-in, two-out as they relate to changes in fees and charges that are not related to any change in regulatory scope.</p>

          <p>The overall costs of higher petition deposits were estimated to be around £0.51m. The IA showed that just over half of this cost will be incurred by large public bodies such as HMRC and Local Government. Large businesses, banks and debt recovery agencies will incur a significant amount of the remaining costs to creditors from these changes meaning small and micro business creditors are only likely to incur a small share of the additional costs.  </p>

          <p>The changes to the SOS fee will mean a reduction in the amount paid and all other things equal higher amounts of assets available to be paid to creditors. The distribution of funds to creditors follows a prioritisation set out in statute. The groups include secured creditors (often banks), preferential creditors such as former employees, floating charge holders (again usually banks) and unsecured creditors including HMRC and other businesses. The benefits from the lower SOS fees are likely to be greater for creditors that are higher up the prioritisation scale. Secured creditors and floating charge holders are often large businesses as are HMRC and Local Government. Small and micro business creditors are therefore likely to receive a small share of the benefits of the lower SOS fee. </p>

          <p>Previous deposit increases occurred in June 2011 and April 2014 and are highlighted in table 9. It is difficult to definitively say that deposit increases will not impact on case numbers but there does not appear to be strong effect as pre-existing downwards trends appear to account for much of the changes in case numbers  and in the case of compulsory liquidations caseload increased following the fee increase. Therefore we tentatively conclude that the increases in November 2015 deposit changes will not have a significant negative effect on case numbers.    </p>
