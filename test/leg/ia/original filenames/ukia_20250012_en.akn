          <p>Tuition fees are the amount of money paid by students to HE providers to cover the costs of teaching. Tuition fees for students with home fee status enrolled at an English HE provider were introduced for the 1998/99 academic year and originally fixed at £1,000. </p>

          <p>The maximum tuition fee limit for students with home fee status enrolled on a full-time undergraduate course at a HE provider in England was raised to £3,000 in 2006/07 and then to £9,000 in 2012/13 as part of wider reforms to increase funding into the English HE sector and place it on a more financially secure and sustainable footing<authorialNote marker="1"><p> HM Government White Paper (2011), found here <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/31384/11-944-higher-education-students-at-heart-of-system.pdf"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/31384/11-944-higher-education-students-at-heart-of-system.pdf</u></a> </p></authorialNote>.

Tuition fees are paid directly to the provider by the Student Loans Company (SLC)<authorialNote marker="4"><p> The SLC is a non-departmental public body that administers loans and grants on behalf of the Department for Education to eligible students enrolled on a HE course.</p></authorialNote> in three instalments (per academic year) with the value of the loan then repaid by the student once they are earning above the relevant minimum repayment threshold, which is based upon the amount they earn. This system ensures that HE tuition is free at the point of access for students taking out the full loan, and that the upfront cost of study does not act as a barrier to participation.</p>

        <content>
          <p>The teaching of UK domiciled undergraduate students at Approved (fee cap) providers in England is funded by a combination of income from tuition fees paid by the student and top-up funding called the Strategic Priorities Grant (SPG). The SPG is allocated to HE providers via the Office for Students (OfS), the independent regulator for HE in England, and is used to help fund the teaching of higher cost courses and students. Approved providers are not eligible for SPG funding.</p>

        <content>
          <p>The cost of HE is shared between the student and the taxpayer, and the balance of contributions has changed over time<authorialNote marker="7"><p> Cost sharing is a fundamental economic principle of the HE funding and student finance system, reflecting the fact that both the student and taxpayer benefits from their co-investment in HE. The student benefits as a HE qualification gives them better career prospects and opportunities to the extent that they are more likely to be in sustained high skilled employment earning higher salaries over the course of their working life compared to someone who does not go to HE. The taxpayer also benefits due to the wider economic and societal gains that are generated by having a pipeline of graduate skills. Higher level skills are an important driver of productivity economic growth and standards of living and are critically important for the delivery of high-quality public services in the areas of education, health and social care. See for example, <a href="https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1531411/1/Callender_cost%20sharing_book.chapter.pdf"><u>https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1531411/1/Callender_cost%20sharing_book.chapter.pdf</u></a>  and <a href="https://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/nb/Barr_HEReview100215.pdf"><u>https://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/nb/Barr_HEReview100215.pdf</u></a></p></authorialNote>. The HE reforms of 2012/13 resulted in a significant shift in the way the teaching of UK domiciled undergraduates at Approved (fee cap) providers in England is funded away from direct teaching grants paid by the taxpayer to tuition fees paid by the student (see Figure 1 below). </p>

          <p>The taxpayer is forecast to subsidise 29% of the full-time undergraduate higher education Plan 5 loans issued in financial year 2023-24<authorialNote marker="8"><p> <a href="https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/student-loan-forecasts-for-england/2023-24"><u>https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/student-loan-forecasts-for-england/2023-24</u></a> </p></authorialNote>.  This is because outstanding student loan debt is written off after a fixed period (40 years for Plan 5 loans). This is known as the Resource Accounting and Budgeting (RAB) charge, and represents the estimated cost to the taxpayer of borrowing to support the student finance system. </p>

According to published analysis by the OfS, publicly funded teaching activity (i.e. UK domiciled students) at 128 universities in England and Northern Ireland (which accounts for the majority of HE sector income and expenditure) recorded a deficit of some £1.44bn in 2022/23, representing around 10.6% of total income for that sub-group (Figure 4).</p>

In the last year there have been examples of job losses at some HE providers with others closing down certain courses, degree programmes or even entire faculties and departments with around 70 providers across the UK running restructuring and redundancy programmes<authorialNote marker="17"><p>Live page of redundancies, restructures and reorganisations and closures taking place across the sector, found here <a href="https://qmucu.org/qmul-transformation/uk-he-shrinking/"><u>https://qmucu.org/qmul-transformation/uk-he-shrinking/</u></a> </p></authorialNote>. </p>

          <p>Raising tuition fees is therefore needed to improve the financial sustainability of teaching UK domiciled students and of HE providers and the sector as a whole. Without action, continued reductions in the real value of tuition fees, against a backdrop of rising costs, could put at further risk student outcomes – for example reducing the number and range of courses available to some students and eroding the quality of teaching and the wider learning experience that students receive. There would also be an increasing risk of some providers exiting the sector, with associated consequences for students.</p>

          <p>Research in UK universities is heavily dependent on cross subsidy from international student fees. High quality research activity at some HE providers may therefore also be at risk if they need to increasingly divert any financial surpluses from international students away from funding research to subsidising the teaching of UK domiciled students.</p>

          <p>A key measure of success will be that HE providers transform their business models in a financially sustainable way and we do not see a deterioration in the quality of teaching provision because HE providers perceive they have insufficient resources.

DAs could choose to increase the fee loans that they make available to students from the DAs studying in England (to match the new fee limits). The DAs set their own fee limits for English students studying at providers in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland and their HE providers would be able to benefit from additional fee income if the DAs chose to apply the same percentage increase to fee limits for English domiciled students that had been applied by the Westminster Government. This impact assessment considers only the expected impacts on English HE providers and does not consider the expected impacts on the devolved nations. </p>

          <p>Figure 5 presents the logic map of how an increase in domestic undergraduate tuition fees flows through to the activities, outputs, outcomes and impacts of this change. Raising fees would maintain funding levels in real terms which would allow HE providers to maintain levels of spending on teaching related activities such as staff, course content and teaching facilities. This, in turn, would lead to HE providers being able to continue their current offer of high-quality courses to students across a variety of subjects. Overall, a fee increase would help mitigate against the current financial pressures the sector is facing. The logic model sets out the positive impacts this could have on HE provider behaviour. </p>

          <p>Under a potential option involving an extensive regulatory overhaul, price cap regulation would be completely removed meaning that HE providers would be free to charge tuition fees at whatever level they chose appropriate. Under this option, tuition fees at many HE providers would likely be set above the current maximum fee limit<authorialNote marker="28"><p> Tuition fees for postgraduate courses are not regulated and fees charged by providers can be significantly above the maximum tuition fee limit for undergraduate courses.</p></authorialNote>. </p>

        <content>
          <p>This would result in a situation whereby access to HE would be based on the ability to pay rather than the ability to learn. Faced with potentially higher fees that are unregulated, there’s a risk that students who are comparatively more debt averse (e.g. disadvantaged students) could be less likely to pursue HE because they deem it too costly, even though they would benefit from it. Although historical data shows entry rates to HE for those from disadvantaged backgrounds follow the same trend as those from more advantaged backgrounds when previous capped tuition fees increased, it is less certain how these trends would be for an uncapped fee system, where the risk of a disproportionate impact could be higher.</p>

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>A system of uncapped tuition fees with uncapped loans would also be less affordable for the taxpayer since it would increase the amount of total fee loan outlay on student support at a time when student numbers are projected to grow further and public finances are recovering from recent shocks to the UK economy. If the cap still applied to the loans but not the fee limits, there is a risk that some students would not be able to afford to pay the shortfall at HE providers charging over the loan limit, thereby essentially creating a tiered system in HE where students from disadvantaged backgrounds would unfairly face a more restricted set of choices when applying to HE.</p>

However, data returns on non-academic staff have been voluntary since academic year 2019/20. Given that not all HE providers have reported their non-academic staff numbers for 2022/23, a ratio between academic/non-academic staff from 2018/19 HESA data is used to estimate missing non-academic staff numbers for 2022/23<authorialNote marker="32"><p> A provider level ratio is used if available, otherwise the median ratio from 2018/19 is applied</p></authorialNote>.</p>

          <p>While Approved providers on the OfS register are proportionately more likely to be smaller than Approved (fee cap) providers (which includes nearly all the universities), they will not be affected by the increase in tuition fee limits since their fees are uncapped. However, tuition fee loan limits at Approved providers would still increase by forecast RPIX inflation under the preferred option, which could see some increase their fees, where they have set them in line with the loan limit.</p>

          <p>This measure is deregulatory in terms of impact on businesses. This is because raising the tuition fee cap to a higher-level means that HE providers will have greater financial resources which will enable them to maintain or spend more on their core activities than they previously were able to. For this reason, we would not exempt micro, small, and medium providers from these regulations. </p>

          <p>HE providers have different funding models meaning they are proportionately more reliant on some sources of income and funding than others. Accordingly, maintaining the value of tuition fees for academic year 2025/26 in real terms and the corresponding income thereby generated will proportionately impact some providers more than others. In percentage terms, the financial benefit will be proportionately greater for teaching intensives which tend to be more reliant on undergraduate tuition fee income.</p>

The total outlay cost of a fee increase is estimated at £331m in academic year 2025/26.

The rate at which borrowers repay their loans will not be affected by this policy so while in repayment, the monthly cost of repaying the loan will remain the same. For those who do fully repay, the additional loan balance is repaid as additional time at the end of repayments (up to the 40-year limit) rather than increasing monthly outgoings soon after graduation</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">We have considered whether an increase in the tuition fee limit may incentivise some Approved providers to register in the Approved (fee cap) category, or whether it might encourage unregistered providers to now join the OfS register under any registration category. Our assessment is that the increase in fees is relatively small compared with the costs of registration, and therefore unlikely to have an impact on HE providers switching registration category or their decision to register with the OfS. For example, the fee for a Quality and Standards assessment before making a decision on registration is currently £28,463, which is only one part of the registration process. Additionally, there is a requirement to recruit an independent member of the governing body if a provider is in receipt of OfS or UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) funding which would involve costs.</p>

          <p>The main external factor that may influence the impact of additional tuition fee income on the delivery of high-quality teaching and learning are the decisions that HE providers make as independent autonomous institutions about how to spend the income they receive from tuition fees. However, given the size of the deficit HE providers have been carrying on publicly funded teaching, we think this risk is low. Historically, most HE providers have charged the maximum limit, so they will likely take advantage of this additional uplift.</p>

          <p>We recognise that UK tuition fee income is only a portion of providers’ overall income (in 2022/23, UK tuition fee income was 28% of all income for HE providers in England) and other factors will therefore influence whether the policy objectives are achieved.

          <p>Administrative burdens of complying with this regulation are assessed to be low. The regulation is related to tuition fee loans and limits. The regulation itself does not directly affect the roles and responsibilities of HE providers or the activities that they carry out. There may be some indirect administrative burden on HE providers to update their website or other documents with information on the new fee loans and limits, however, we do not see this as additional, as HE providers are assumed to check and update their websites and documentation each year when fee information is confirmed. </p>

          <p>Our modelling uses the latest available student number and finance data submitted by HE providers to the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA). The increase in the maximum tuition fee limit will affect only Approved (fee cap) providers in England since they are subject to maximum fee limits that they can charge UK domiciled students on undergraduate courses. Our analysis is based on the 190 Approved (fee cap) providers which submitted student and finance data to HESA in 2022/23. These include all the publicly funded universities and smaller specialist HE providers but not Further Education Colleges (FECs) since they submit their data to the Education and Skills Funding Agency. </p>

We assume that HE providers charge the average fee for a home undergraduate student in 2022/23 of £8,440 and that this will increase by 3.1% in line with inflation to £8,700 in 2025/26 and remain constant thereafter.</p>

The figure of £8,440, which is below the £9,250 current cap, reflects the fact that a proportion of students will not be paying the maximum tuition fee because they receive fee waivers (i.e. a discount on the fees they pay) or have a fixed fee contract with the HE providers meaning that their fees do not change for the duration of their course.</p></authorialNote> and therefore setting fee income to £9,250 would lead to an overestimate in income. However, our analysis does not take account of the expected financial impact of raising fees charged by HE providers who are subject to lower limits because they do not have either or both an access and participation plan and TEF award for teaching or the potential impact on Approved providers who are not subject to fee limits and would not be directly affected by a fee increase, (although students at these providers would have access to higher tuition fee loan amounts) <authorialNote marker="40"><p> It is possible that if tuition fee loans increase this could, indirectly, impact on fees that Approved providers choose to charge, and accordingly the fee income they receive. Given the relatively small number of students at these providers, we have not included this possible impact in our analysis.</p></authorialNote>. These exclusions are small in terms of the number of students on these courses or at these providers. As such, our analysis will serve to underestimate, albeit slightly, the total impact on HE providers. It is also an underestimate as our analysis excludes students on other courses e.g. part-time, accelerated degrees and students at FECs.</p>

The long-term entrant’s growth rate is solely based on population projections by age and therefore assumes no changes in applicant and provider behaviour. Therefore, it is not directly comparable to the short-term forecast, which has a much more in-depth methodology and is held to a lot of scrutiny in each model’s board. </p>

There is a risk that the increased loan balance may be off-putting to some potential applicants, particularly those from more deprived backgrounds.
