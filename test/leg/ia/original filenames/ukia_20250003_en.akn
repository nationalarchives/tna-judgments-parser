In addition, a smaller subset of services will be designated as Category 1 (large user-to-user services), Category 2A (large search services) or Category 2B (other regulated user-to-user services), and must comply with additional duties, which are set out in the legislation (Annex A). </p>

This includes content that promotes, encourages, or provides instructions for suicide, self-harm or eating disorders, and content that is abusive, or incites hate, based on the characteristics which are set out in section 16 of the Act. Where users are likely to access this content, Category 1 providers will be required to proactively offer optional features to adults which reduce the likelihood of users encountering such content or alert them to the nature of it. The duties have been designed to be tech neutral and focus on systems and processes, so that they are futureproofed to deal with harms posed by new and emerging technology. </p>

This will mean that services which fall into these thresholds must comply with additional safety duties which apply to their category, which will in turn protect users from further online harm. Ofcom will also create a list of emerging Category 1 services as required by the OSA using these threshold conditions. Services will be placed on this list if they meet the conditions set out in section 97, such as whether the number of users they have is 75% of the user number threshold in the Regulations. To inform this, Ofcom will use its statutory information gathering powers to request the relevant information from services, including information about user numbers and relevant functionalities/characteristics.    </p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">A non-regulatory option is not possible, as the OSA requires the Secretary of State to make regulations on categorisation. The policy option of “do nothing” would halt implementation of the OSA, as without the regulations on categorisation thresholds, Ofcom would not be able to designate services as Category 1, Category 2A or Category 2B, and they would not be required to comply with additional duties. </p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">The option of diverging from Ofcom’s advice on the thresholds was considered. However, the Secretary of State was content with Ofcom’s advice for Category 1, 2A, and 2B on user numbers, functionalities and, where relevant characteristics (as set out in Annex B) and has made the Regulations on this basis having considered factors as required by the OSA. It was assessed that this was the most robust approach, as it was based on evidence and their regulatory judgement. </p>
                <p class="ia-table-text" />
                <p class="ia-table-text">Whilst Schedule 11 does allow for a threshold condition to be set for Category 1 or 2B without a user number threshold, this was not recommended by Ofcom. Ofcom note in paragraph 3.30 of their advice why they discounted a threshold condition for Category 1 which only referenced functionalities and characteristics and in paragraph 5.25 their rationale for setting the recommended user number threshold for Category 2B. </p>

If this option was progressed, then services would not be Categorised as Category 1, 2A, or 2B, and so would not be subject to the additional duties of their category. This includes transparency reporting and bereaved parents’ access to data (Category 1, 2A, and 2B), enhanced risk assessment and record keeping and fraudulent advertising duties (Category 1 and 2A), as well as user empowerment, user verification, terms of service duties, protections for news publishers, journalistic content and content of democratic importance, and an impact assessment on freedom of expression and privacy (Category 1). The full table of duties is set out in Annex A. Schedule 11 of the OSA also requires Ofcom to carry out research into the categorisation and following this, the DSIT SoS must make regulations are reasonably practicable. This option would not deliver the desired outcome of the legislation and is not possible as the DSIT SoS is bound to make regulations. </p>

          <p>Ensuring clarity for services: As a result of the government making regulations on categorisation thresholds, Ofcom must create a register of categorised services. Services in scope of the OSA will be made aware if they fall into Category 1, 2A or 2B, and must comply with additional duties. In addition, user-to-user services that meet the conditions set out in section 97 of the OSA and are close to reaching the Category 1 threshold, will be placed on the ‘List of emerging Category 1 services’ by Ofcom. This process provides services with notice that they are close to reaching the relevant Category 1 threshold and may, in the future, have to comply with additional obligations. </p>

          <p>The regulations will set the thresholds for Category 1, Category 2A and Category 2B services in secondary legislation. To establish a register of categorised services, Ofcom will use its statutory information gathering powers to request the relevant information from services, including information about user numbers and relevant functionalities/characteristics. Where an additional duty is subject to a code of practice, that duty will not apply until a code of practice in relation to the particular duty is in force (see section 51 of the OSA). Ofcom also has a duty to provide guidance to support compliance with various duties such as relating to record keeping and review, user verification, user empowerment and terms of service (sections 52, 53, 65 and 73). In relation to specific duties, such as the user empowerment assessment, Category 1 services will have three months to complete the assessment and there is a provision to request an extension (Schedule 3). </p>

        <intro>
          <p>Compared with the OSA Enactment IA, our estimates of compliance costs have fallen by between £35.9m and £58.9m, as set out in Table 4 Table  SEQ Table \* ARABIC 4 – Reduction in aggregated compliance costs estimates compared with OSA Enactment IAbelow. The fall in costs is driven by the reduction in the estimate of the number of providers in Category 1, though this is counteracted to a small extent by an increase in the number of providers in Category 2B. Because the bulk of compliance costs fall on Category 1 and Category 2A providers, the change in the expected number of Category 1 providers has more influence on the estimated costs than an equivalent change in Category 2B providers.</p>

Ofcom will consider a range of factors in determining what information providers will need to produce in their reports. This includes (but is not limited to) the kind of service provided, its functionalities, its user base. It is likely that the information requested will vary between different services.

          <p>In determining what is proportionate when offering user empowerment content tools, the Act sets out that the findings of the most recent user empowerment assessment including the incidence of user empowerment content on their service, and the size and capacity of the service are relevant. Ofcom will set out in a code of practice how companies can comply with the user empowerment tools duty and in guidance how companies can comply with their user empowerment assessment duty. Therefore, in instances where smaller services have this duty, or a service assesses that they have (and can evidence) a low incidence of user empowerment content, we expect initial set up costs and ongoing compliance costs to be minimal. </p>

          <p>There are no direct monetisable benefits to business resulting from regulation enabled by this secondary legislation. We do anticipate a decrease in overall online harms in the UK which may create an indirect benefit for providers of having to spend less to counteract potential online harms on their providers because harmful content is removed early, before it has been shared throughout the service, as well as preserving the mental and physical health of their users.</p>

          <p>The benefit flowing from regulation enabled by this piece of secondary legislation is the increased safety for users provided by the duties set out in this legislation that relevant providers must abide by. Though we do not have an estimate for the effect of the policy on the rate of online harms, we can estimate the magnitude of social benefits/avoided harms required for the policy to “break even” with the costs to providers of complying with regulations enabled by this legislation. Our estimated cost of compliance, over the ten-year period, is £55.2m-£229.0m, therefore an estimated monetised benefit of £55.2m-£229.0m in avoided online harms would be required to offset the cost. This is equivalent to a 0.02%-0.09% decrease in the estimated £254bn of detriment caused by online harms in the UK, according to the OSA Enactment IA.</p>

For modelling purposes, we assume that currently just one business with fewer than 50 employees could fall into Category 2B, but we do not expect any microbusinesses (fewer than 10 employees) to fall into this category, however, there is potential for this to occur within the regulation, even if such a scenario is extremely unlikely.

However, we assume that there are no businesses with a UK presence and fewer than 500 employees which may fall into Category 1. For modelling purposes, we estimate that around three medium-sized businesses could fall into Category 2B. However, as explained, the duties on Category 2B services are significantly less than those incumbent on Categories 1 and 2A.

However, the categorisation thresholds take a tiered approach, so that categorised services with a smaller reach (of at least 5% reach, i.e. Category 2B) will only have to comply with the additional duties related to transparency reporting and disclosure of information about use of the service by a deceased child user. </p>

          <p>The protection of content of democratic importance could contribute to a healthier public discourse and democratic process. However, it could also lead to debates about the role of tech providers in moderating content and the potential for censorship and bias. There could also be the possibility that different providers have unique definitions of what content is classed as democratically important, or journalistic which risks an imbalance across providers. The OSA mitigates this by providing a definition of “content of democratic importance” under section 17, as well as embedding the importance of principles such as freedom of expression and diversity of political opinion into these duties. This means that providers must account for these when putting in place systems and processes to comply. </p>

This must be carried out after two-to-five years after the last of the provisions of Part 3 of the OSA comes into force. The review must consider the framework as a whole but must specifically look at how the OSA ensures that regulation of services is proportionate, having regard to the level of risk of harm presented by services of different kinds and to the size and capacity of providers. </p>
