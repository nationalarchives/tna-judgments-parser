          <p>The increase in maximum tuition fees and loan limits for full-time, full-time accelerated and part-time undergraduate courses by forecast RPIX inflation of 3.1%<authorialNote marker="1"><p> RPIX – Retail Price Index excluding mortgage interest. This is the forecast RPIX figure for the first quarter of the 2026 calendar year which was published by the OBR as part of its macro-economic forecasts in October 2024 Forecast and Outturn RPIX inflation figures are set out in table 1.7 of the Detailed Forecast tables here: https://view.officeapps.live.com/op/view.aspx?src=https%3A%2F%2Fobr.uk%2Fdocs%2Fdlm_uploads%2FEconomy_Detailed_forecast_tables_October_2024.xlsx&amp;wdOrigin=BROWSELINK published by the Office for Budget Responsibility as part of their Economic and Fiscal Outlook on 30 October 2024  alongside the Budget.</p></authorialNote> is expected to have a broadly neutral impact as the increase is in nominal terms meaning the total level of debt for Student Loan Company (SLC) funded students should remain unchanged in real terms.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>We do not believe that the increase in tuition fee limits will significantly alter participation decisions for most students as the value of tuition fees will remain unchanged in real terms and the commensurate increase in tuition fee loans will ensure that higher education (HE) remains free at the point of access for those eligible for SLC support.  </p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>It is possible that SLC borrowers considered to be comparatively more debt averse – specifically students who are female, older, Black, from an ethnic minority or have a known disability – could be negatively or disproportionately negatively impacted if they perceive the cost of study to have increased to the point that they choose not to participate in HE because they now deem it unaffordable. However, we consider this risk to be low as the latest available data shows that HE acceptance numbers and participation rates are higher today than they were in 2010/11 before tuition fees rose to £9,000.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>The lowering of tuition fees for classroom-based foundation years is expected to lower in nominal and real terms the total level of debt accrued by SLC funded students who choose this entry route into HE. We expect those SLC borrowers choosing this pathway into HE who are comparatively more debt averse to be positively or disproportionately positively impacted by this planned change.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Prospective foundation years students who are comparatively less geographically mobile could be negatively or disproportionately negatively impacted if the lowering of tuition fees leads to a contraction in provision which limits access to HE in their area. We however deem the risk to be low as we believe there are a sufficient alternative entry routes into HE besides foundation years available at comparatively lower cost to students. </p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>The increase in loans for living costs for undergraduate students, loans for postgraduate master’s and doctoral degree students, targeted grants and disabled students’ allowance by forecast RPIX inflation of 3.1% is expected to also have a broadly neutral impact. This is because the planned increase is in nominal terms meaning the level of debt for SLC borrowers should remain unchanged in real terms.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>It is possible that comparatively more debt averse SLC borrowers could be negatively or disproportionately negatively impacted if they perceive the cost of study to have increased to the point that they are discouraged from pursuing HE because they now consider it too expensive. However, failing to increase loans for living costs by inflation would likely pose a greater risk, as the level of financial support provided would increasingly not meet students’ living costs.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>In principle, the planned student finance changes should not be significant enough to alter participation decisions since the impact of increasing support by forecast inflation means a nominal but not a real terms increase in student debt. Moreover, the uplift to tuition fee and maintenance loans will only increase lifetime repayments for those borrowers who are already forecast to repay their loans in full. Lower lifetime earners will see no increase in their lifetime repayments due to the loan increases, and no borrowers will see higher monthly repayments when they start repaying their loans. </p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>While the increase in loan support should maintain the spending power of students at their current levels it will not offset the significant erosion in the real value of SLC support which has occurred in the last few years due to the spike in inflation. This means there is still a potentially higher likelihood that SLC borrowers who are comparatively more debt averse may be being discouraged from participating in HE because they do not view it as affordable.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>So far, no clear evidence has yet emerged to indicate that this risk has materialised for students with protected characteristics or from disadvantaged groups. Data shows that HE acceptance numbers for the latest application cycle are higher than the previous year while progression rates into HE have held up for most protected groups. </p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>The latest UCAS entry rate data for 2024 shows the entry rate for disadvantaged students who were previously in receipt of free school meals (FSM) and those from low HE participation areas increased compared to 2023 and are above pre-pandemic levels, although the gap between advantaged and disadvantaged students remains persistently large and stubborn. </p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Further research is however needed to understand whether the rising cost of study and student finance changes have started to influence students’ decision-making behaviour, the choices they make and the outcomes they achieve.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>It is possible that students have started to make different decisions about HE but that it is too early or not possible to observe this in the data. One area of investigation would be to explore whether comparatively more debt averse students are now being more discouraged by the perceived increase in the cost of study which has had a dampening effect on HE participation rates.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Separately, survey evidence shows that students are increasingly turning to part-time employment to supplement the income they receive from their SLC loans, grants and allowances. However, we do not know the extent to which this is happening among students with protected characteristics or from disadvantaged groups.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Regarding the three limbs of the Public Sector Equality Duty, we do not consider that the planned changes will amount to unlawful discrimination. While certain groups are more likely to be affected, the planned changes are intended to safeguard the financial sustainability of the HE sector (which is in the best interests of all students) and ensure that cost and affordability are not barriers to participating in HE, especially for those who are comparatively more sensitive to the cost of study and debt averse.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>We consider the student finance changes are required to continue advancing equality of opportunity. Given rising living costs due to inflation increases in loan and grant support are necessary to ensure that access to HE continues to be based on the ability to learn, not the ability to pay. In the absence of further increases in loan, grants and allowances HE may become less affordable, increasing the risk that some students, especially those groups who are deemed to be comparatively more debt averse, are discouraged from participating in HE, even though they would benefit from it.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>We do not consider that the package of changes to tuition fees and student loan arrangements would have any significant impact on the need to foster good relations between persons who share a particular protected characteristic and those who do not.  We do not consider that any frustrations felt by students who are more impacted positively or negatively by the planned changes would affect relationships with others who are less impacted by them.</p>

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>There could be perceptions of unfairness if the policies are most likely to be seen as affecting certain students – for example those considering classroom-based foundation years as an entry route into HE. However, the aims of this policy are to reduce the disproportionate growth of foundation years that represent poor value for money, whilst ensuring that students who continue to access HE through this route pay a fairer price. </p>

          <p>Some students feel constrained about HE choices due to affordability and/or costs.  In 2022, around three in ten (30%) pupils and learners in years 12 and 13 in 2022 reported that their plans for education or training had changed because of the rising cost of living<authorialNote marker="11"><p> https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/parent-pupil-and-learner-panel-omnibus-surveys-for-2021-to-2022</p></authorialNote>.

      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>More recent research in 2024 showed that the cost of HE is one of the reasons why young people are not planning to apply to HE. Similarly, affordability was reported as a reason by around a fifth of students in year 13 who did not intend to apply to university in 2023<authorialNote marker="12"><p> https://cosmostudy.uk/publications/the-class-of-2023-opportunities-and-university-plans </p></authorialNote>. There is evidence to show that financial factors can impact on students’ choice of provider, location of study, and the subject studied, as well as intensity of study, i.e. whether to study full-time or part-time<authorialNote marker="13"><p> https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/student-income-and-expenditure-survey-2014-to-2015 </p></authorialNote>,<authorialNote marker="14"><p> https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/student-income-and-expenditure-survey-2021-to-2022 </p></authorialNote>. </p>

          <p>Recent research shows that young people in the lowest income category were least likely to be planning to enter HE in 2023, as were those whose families use a food bank<authorialNote marker="15"><p>https://cosmostudy.uk/publication_pdfs/post-18-aspirations-and-opportunities-final.pdf<a href="https://cosmostudy.uk/publications/the-class-of-2023-opportunities-and-university-plans" /></p></authorialNote>. Disadvantaged individuals are more likely to constrain their HE choices compared with more advantaged students. Young people who plan to live at home whilst studying in HE are disproportionately more likely to be those from families facing financial challenges. Young people from families which reported using a food bank in the past year were much more likely to plan on living at home compared to those that did not use a food bank. The same was true for those from families which are behind with their housing payments<authorialNote marker="16"><p> https://cosmostudy.uk/publications/the-class-of-2023-opportunities-and-university-plans</p></authorialNote>. </p>

          <p>The tuition fee increase is intended to improve the financial sustainability of HE providers at a time when the sector is facing increasing and wide-ranging financial challenges and cost pressures including: the impacts of inflation, higher staff pay and pension contributions, a challenging recruitment environment, increased financial support for students experiencing hardship, and rising operating and energy costs associated with maintaining and running their estate. According to the Office for Students, nearly three quarters of regulated HE providers in England could be in deficit by 2025-26 and many providers will need to take bold action to remain financial sustainable<authorialNote marker="18"><p> https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/media/nn2fnrkx/financial-sustainability-november-2024.pdf </p></authorialNote>.</p>

          <p>Lowering tuition fee limits for foundation years in classroom-based subjects – such as business and administration, and social sciences – is intended to stem the disproportionate growth of foundation years in these subjects, and improve value for money to students and taxpayers by lowering the cost of study for this provision so that it is more in line with functionally similar alternatives such as Access to HE Diplomas which offer broadly the same outcomes.</p>

          <p>The planned increase in tuition fee loans will enable students eligible for SLC support to continue to fully cover the upfront cost of their chosen course, thereby ensuring that HE remains free at the point of access. The similar increase in loan support to cover living costs is intended to ensure that students can continue making the same spending decisions as they did previously with regards to accommodation, travel, food, and utilities – the costs of which will have been rising over time due to inflation<authorialNote marker="20"><p> Consumer price inflation: December 2023 published by the Office for National Statistics. </p></authorialNote>.</p>

          <p>In academic year 2022/23, nearly 993,000 full-time English domiciled undergraduate students had their tuition fees mainly funded by SLC<authorialNote marker="22"><p> DfE analysis of HESA Student Record data</p></authorialNote>. This represented around 84.5% of the total English domiciled undergraduate students enrolled at an English provider.</p>

        <content>
          <p>New and existing students may face a nominal increase in tuition fees, depending on whether HE providers choose, or are able, to implement the fee uplift. For students who take out an SLC fee loan to cover the upfront cost of course fees, total student loan debt will also rise in nominal terms.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>We do not expect the planned increase in tuition fees will be significant enough to alter participation decisions. First, the cost of study is one of many financial and non-financial factors which prospective students consider when making decisions about whether to participate in HE and is not necessarily the most influential one<authorialNote marker="23"><p> https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/influence-of-financial-factors-on-higher-education-decision-making </p></authorialNote>.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Second, the increase in tuition fees will be accompanied by a commensurate increase in tuition fee loans ensuring that participation in HE remains free at the point of access for those eligible for SLC support.  Finally, while tuition fees and tuition fee loans would rise in nominal terms they would remain unchanged in real terms as would the level of debt that students may take on to cover course costs.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>There is little evidence to suggest that the previous increases in tuition fees and loans in 2012 and 2017 have had a negative impact on HE decision making. As Tables 3 and 4 below show, HE application numbers and participation rates for students with different characteristics are, in most cases, comparatively higher in 2022/23 than 2010/11 (before tuition fees were raised to £9,000).</p>

          <p>It is possible that despite tuition fees, loans and student debt remaining unchanged in real terms, there is potentially a higher risk that some students may perceive the cost of study to have increased, to the extent that they may be more likely to be discouraged from pursuing HE because they now view it as too expensive, even though they would benefit from it.</p>

          <p>This is because some groups, due to their personal characteristics or circumstances, are comparatively more likely to be cost sensitive and debt averse. Evidence shows that this is particularly likely to be the case for those groups which have work, family or financial commitments or would likely face comparatively higher costs of study.</p>

          <p>Tables 5 to 13 below break down the population of full-time English domiciled undergraduates paying tuition fees at an English HE provider for the following characteristics: sex, age, disability, gender identity, ethnicity, religion or other belief and sexual orientation. There is currently no robust data collected on marriage and civil partnership, pregnancy and maternity meaning we cannot assess at this point the expected impact of the planned changes to tuition fees and loan limits on these groups.</p>

          <p>Female students could be disproportionately negatively impacted. This is because they are slightly over-represented in the population of students who pay fees via SLC loans and are more likely to be debt averse, for example because they have caring or family commitments. While debt levels will remain unchanged in real terms, there is a risk that they could perceive the cost of study to have still risen, increasing the likelihood that they could be discouraged from participating in HE as they deem it more expensive than before. However, females who take out student loans are less likely to be financially impacted by the increases in loan amounts than average, due to lower average lifetime earnings<authorialNote marker="24"><p> https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/leo-graduate-and-postgraduate-outcomes </p></authorialNote> <authorialNote marker="25"><p> https://www.hesa.ac.uk/news/13-06-2024/sb268-higher-education-graduate-outcomes-statistics/salary </p></authorialNote> and corresponding increased likelihood of having some loan debt written off at the end of the loan term.</p>

          <p>Students who are Muslim could be disproportionately negatively impacted This is because they are slightly over-represented in the population of students who pay fees via SLC loans and are more likely to be debt averse on account of their faith. There is a risk that some groups of Muslim students who are opposed to interest bearing loans and instead choose to self-fund their studies may perceive the cost of study to have risen and therefore choose not to participate, even though tuition fees remain unchanged in real terms. There is some evidence that religion or belief is associated with different levels of employment and earnings, with those who identify as Muslim less likely to be in employment<authorialNote marker="28"><p> https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/culturalidentity/religion/articles/religioneducationandworkinenglandandwales/february2020#economic-activity</p></authorialNote>. If this trend is seen among graduates, then Muslim students who take out student loans are less likely to be financially impacted by the increases in loan amounts than average, due to lower average lifetime earnings and corresponding increased likelihood of having some loan debt written off at the end of the loan term.</p>

          <p>Students who are Christian, belong to another religion or categorise themselves as no religion are slightly more over-represented while students who are Buddhist, Hindu, or Jewish are under-represented. Sikh students are neither over- or under-represented in the population of students who pay fees via SLC loan. We are yet to find evidence to suggest that changes in the cost of study and student finance have a significant influence on HE decision making for these groups of students. We therefore expect the impact to be neutral but will keep this assessment under review and consider any new data that becomes available.</p>

          <p>Students who are Black, Asian, Mixed or other ethnic groups could be at risk of negative impacts. This is because they are more likely to be debt averse meaning that there is a potential increased risk that they could perceive the cost of study to have risen and therefore be discouraged from participating in HE due to the increase in tuition fees and loans, even though tuition fees and loan remain unchanged in real terms. The potential negative impact could fall disproportionately on Black students as they are over-represented in the population of students who pay fees via SLC loans. This compares with students from Asian or other ethnic groups are slightly under-represented.</p>

          <p>While not a protected characteristic, the most disadvantaged group of students (as represented by those in POLAR4 Quintile 1) could be disproportionately negatively impacted. This is because they are over-represented in the population of students who pay their fees via SLC loans and are more likely to be debt averse on account of their financial circumstances. While the level of debt would remain unchanged in real terms, there is a risk that they could perceive the cost of pursuing HE to have risen increasing the likelihood that they could be discouraged from participating as they deem it more expensive than before. However, disadvantaged students who take out student loans are less likely to be financially impacted by the increases in loan amounts than average, due to lower average lifetime earnings<authorialNote marker="29"><p> https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/leo-graduate-and-postgraduate-outcomes </p></authorialNote> and corresponding increased likelihood of having some loan debt written off at the end of the loan term.</p>

          <p>Where classroom-based foundation years are no longer financially viable at the lower tuition fee, provision in these subjects could be scaled back or even fully withdrawn leading to a reduction in access to HE. There is therefore a risk that this proposed change could have a negative impact on those mature students who are less geographically mobile (due to financial and family obligations) and unable to travel to where provision is available. However, we deem this risk to be low as we believe sufficient alternative entry routes into HE exist. </p>

          <p>Students with a known disability are under-represented amongst students in classroom-based foundation years and as such would not be disproportionately impacted by the planned changes.</p>

          <p>Given students with a known disability are expected to face comparatively higher costs of study (due to having additional learning requirements and support needs), the reduction in fee and loan limits would lessen the overall cost of study, thereby positively impacting students with a known disability.</p>

        <content>
          <p>However, similar to mature students, students with a known disability are likely to be less geographically mobile and therefore at risk of being adversely affected by the lowering of tuition fees if it brings about a contraction of provision which limits access to HE in their area. However, we deem this impact to be neutral rather than negative for students because sufficient alternative entry routes to HE are available.</p>

          <p>Female students are under-represented amongst students in classroom-based foundation year subjects. Since female students are more likely to be debt averse (because they are more likely to have family and wider caring responsibilities) they will be positively impacted by the lowering of tuition fees but not disproportionately.</p>

However, with regards Muslim students whose faith prohibits the take of interest-bearing loans there may be a potentially positive impact if the lower fees reduce the cost of study to the extent that it makes entry into HE more affordable for those who can, and choose, to self-fund.</p>

          <p>Students from comparatively more disadvantaged groups (as represented by quintiles 1 and 2) are over-represented amongst students in classroom-based foundation year subjects.

        <content>
          <p>In the same way as tuition fees and loans we do not expect the planned student finance changes to be significant enough to alter participation decisions for most students, including SLC borrowers. This is because the impact of increasing support by forecast inflation will mean a nominal but not a real terms increase in student debt.</p>

        <content>
          <p>No borrowers will see higher monthly repayments when they start repaying their loans due to the increases for 2025/26. This is because student loans are not like consumer loans; monthly repayments depend on borrowers’ earnings, not the amount borrowed or interest rates. Only those borrowers who are forecast to repay their loans in full – 65% of full-time undergraduates starting in 2023/24<authorialNote marker="35"><p> https://explore-education-statistics.service.gov.uk/find-statistics/student-loan-forecasts-for-england </p></authorialNote> - will see an increase in their lifetime repayments due to the fee and loan increases for 2025/26. Borrowers who do not repay their loan in full will see any outstanding balance at the end of their loan term, including interest accrued, continue to be written off at no detriment to the individual.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>While the increase in loan support will maintain the spending power of students at their current levels it will not offset the significant erosion in the real value of SLC support which has occurred in the last few years due to the spike in inflation. This means that there continues to be a higher risk that some students who are comparatively more debt averse could still perceive the cost of study to have increased to the extent that they choose not to participate in HE because they now deem it too expensive.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>So far, no evidence has emerged to indicate that this risk has materialised. Data shows that the number of students receiving acceptances into HE and participation rates have remained broadly stable over the last few years across most student characteristics. One possible reason may be that students are increasingly turning to part-time employment to supplement their income from maintenance loans and grants. Survey evidence shows that 56% of respondents were in paid employment during term time in 2024 compared to 45% in 2022 while the average number hours worked per week have increased over the same period from 12.3 to 14.5%<authorialNote marker="36"><p> https://www.hepi.ac.uk/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/SAES-2024.pdf </p></authorialNote>. However, further research is needed to understand the extent to which this is happening among students with protected characteristics or from disadvantaged groups.</p>

Only England-domiciled borrowers are included (EU-domiciled students are excluded). Age is defined as at start of academic year 2023/24. Figures are for enrolled borrowers not just entrants. There was a change of methodology between 22/23 and 23/24 so the figures should not be compared. Please note the 100% figure for other targeted support last year (22/23) was an error and has been corrected in the above table for 23/24.</p>

          <p>The undergraduate full-time loan for living costs student population is used as the basis for determining whether particular groups are over or under-represented. This is because it has the largest number of claimants (tuition fees loans notwithstanding) which means it is more likely to representative of the whole student population. SLC data shows that for academic year 2023/24, the number of English domiciled undergraduate full-time students receiving a loan for living costs (maintenance loan) was around 1.15m.</p>

        <content>
          <p>Our Family Test Analysis indicates that in general a 3.1% increase to loans and grants for living costs for 2025/26 would not have a particular impact on families. The increase in debt resulting from a 3.1% increase in maximum loans would be in nominal terms only meaning that students with family commitments will be no worse or better off as a result. </p>

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Moreover, the income contingent nature of loan repayments means that the longer-term impact will only be felt by those students with family commitments who go on to earn more than the relevant repayment threshold for their loan type after they graduate. Repayment thresholds are set at £25,000 per year (repayable from April 2026) for undergraduate Plan 5 student loan borrowers starting new courses from the 2023/24 academic year onwards, £27,295 per year for undergraduate Plan 2 loans and £21,000 per year for postgraduate master’s degree and doctoral degree loans (Plan 3).</p>

          <p>We don’t have evidence that the 3.1% uprating to loans and grants will have a differential impact on families, however students with dependants may be more vulnerable to financial risk. A 3.1% increase for 2025/26 to maximum dependants’ grants (ADG, CCG and PLA) and disabled students’ allowance would not have a significant enough impact on financial resources to influence family formation. </p>
