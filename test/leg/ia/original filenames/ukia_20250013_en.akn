          <p>Foundation years are recognised as a valuable pathway into higher education (HE) for adult learners, including those from under-represented or disadvantaged backgrounds. More generally, foundation years offer a second chance for students who have not achieved their potential.</p>

          <p>The number of UK students on foundation years has increased rapidly in recent years, rising from 7,960 in 2011/12 to 71,980 in 2022/23, equating to an average per annum increase of more than 20%.<authorialNote marker="2"><p> Internal analysis of HESA data. </p></authorialNote> The number of HE providers in England offering foundation year provision has increased from 52 to 106 over the same period, with medium, low and unknown tariff providers accounting for 70% of all foundation year providers in 2022/23.<authorialNote marker="3"><p> Ibid.</p></authorialNote></p>

          <p>The Independent Panel (chaired by Sir Philip Augar) to the Review of Post-18 Education and Funding expressed concern about the rapid and disproportionate growth in foundation years<authorialNote marker="4"><p> <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5ceeb35740f0b62373577770/Review_of_post_18_education_and_funding.pdf"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/5ceeb35740f0b62373577770/Review_of_post_18_education_and_funding.pdf</u></a> </p></authorialNote> notably within subject groups which do not carry the expectation of special entry requirements (e.g. business and administrative studies) and within low to medium entry tariff providers (which possess a high proportion of students from low-income households) and questioned whether the significant expansion of foundation years had always been in the best interests of students and taxpayers.<authorialNote marker="5"><p> Ibid.</p></authorialNote></p>

          <p>The core issue is that foundation years are a more expensive route into higher education when compared to functionally similar alternatives such as Access to HE (AHE) Diplomas which seek to achieve broadly the same outcomes as foundation years (i.e. to prepare students for HE study) and are delivered in further education settings. </p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>While learners on AHE Diplomas typically pay lower fees and can apply for an Advanced Learner Loan (ALL) to help cover course costs, foundation year students currently pay up to £9,250 in tuition fees, the same as for subsequent years of undergraduate degree study, which they may choose to fund by taking out a government-backed tuition fee loan from the Student Loans Company (SLC). These loans are subsidised by taxpayers. This means that students choosing the foundation year route are more likely to be taking on additional levels of debt compared to those choosing less costly further education alternatives. </p>

        <content>
          <p>For some subjects, such as business and social sciences, which do not typically have subject-specific entry or skills requirements, the additional year of study is not always necessary. The growth of foundation years entrants has been mainly concentrated in Price Group D (classroom-based subjects), as shown in Figure 1. Data shows that growth in the take-up of foundation years has been fastest in Business and Management studies where the number of entrants grew by 25% between 2015/16 and 2018/19 and by 160% between 2019/20 and 2022/23.<authorialNote marker="6"><p> Internal analysis of HESA data. Separate growth rates reflect subject classification system change in 2019/20 (see footnote 12). </p></authorialNote> In 2022/23, 49% of all UK foundation year entrants were enrolled on Business and Management subjects (compared to 20% of first-year undergraduate entrants).<authorialNote marker="7"><p> Internal analysis of HESA data.</p></authorialNote> Table 2 overleaf provides a summary of change in foundation years students and first year undergraduates from 2015/16 to 2022/23, across several subjects.</p>

          <p>Effective price-cap regulation is needed to ensure that HE and the underlying funding and student finance system remains fair, affordable and delivers good value for money for students and taxpayers. Tuition fees and loans for UK domiciled students on foundation years at HE providers in England are subject to price-cap regulation in the same way as UK domiciled students on standard undergraduate courses. The maximum fee and loan limit for undergraduate courses (which includes foundation years), is currently set at £9,250 for the 2024/25 academic year for full-time courses. This is due to increase to £9,535 in 2025/26.<authorialNote marker="8"><p> More information on the tuition fee and loan system in England can be found within a separate IA on tuition fee increase for academic year 2025/26.</p></authorialNote></p>

          <p>Students do not always have access to complete or high-quality information about their post-18 study options, making it difficult for them to assess the quality and value for money for different courses and pathways to HE. As such, they are at risk of making poorly informed decisions about their learning which do not suit their needs, ability, and financial position or do not represent good value for money.<authorialNote marker="9"><p> <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/693188/Influence_of_finance_on_higher_education_decision-making.pdf"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/693188/Influence_of_finance_on_higher_education_decision-making.pdf</u></a></p></authorialNote></p>

          <p>The current disparity in costs means students choosing the more expensive foundation year route can end up taking out higher levels of debt overall compared to their peers. This is particularly unfair since these students are more likely to be from under-represented and disadvantaged backgrounds. These are groups which tend to face comparatively greater financial barriers to participation in HE.<authorialNote marker="10"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-student-finance-system-impact-on-disadvantaged-young-people"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-student-finance-system-impact-on-disadvantaged-young-people</u></a> </p></authorialNote></p>

          <p>Under the preferred option, maximum tuition fee and loan limits for foundation years in classroom-based subjects (currently designated as Price Group D by the OfS) would be lowered to £5,760. The maximum tuition fee and loan limits for all other foundation year subjects would remain aligned with the maximum fee limit for standard full-time undergraduate courses (which is due to increase to £9,535 in academic year 2025/26). </p>

          <p>The lower tuition fee limits will apply to HE providers registered with the OfS in England, while the lower fee loan limits will apply to English-domiciled students wishing to study classroom-based foundation years anywhere in the UK. The change to loan limits will mean that English students wishing to study classroom-based foundation years in the devolved administrations (DAs) will have their fee loans reduced.</p>

          <p>By lowering the maximum tuition fee HE providers can charge for classroom-based foundation years, we expect to see provision expanding at a much slower rate. Research commissioned by the DfE to inform this policy found that the costs of foundation years can vary, reflecting in part differences in quality, with some provision in classroom-based subjects being delivered for significantly less than the current fee limit for the 2024/25 academic year (£9,250).<authorialNote marker="14"><p> <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1170788/Understanding_the_costs_of_foundation_years_study_research_report.pdf"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1170788/Understanding_the_costs_of_foundation_years_study_research_report.pdf</u></a> </p></authorialNote> Therefore, by lowering tuition fees for classroom-based subjects to a level potentially below the cost of delivering them, HE providers will be encouraged to deliver this provision more efficiently or consider whether more students can be offered direct entry to undergraduate courses (without a foundation year) having studied A-Levels or functionally similar provision (such as AHE Diplomas).</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>The scale of the potential reduction in provision of classroom-based foundation years as a result of lower tuition fees and loan limits will depend on the behavioural response of HE providers and students to the lowering of fees which is difficult to predict accurately.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>On the supply side, HE providers would likely scale back or withdraw some provision in classroom-based subjects because it is not financially viable at the lower fee level (since the lower tuition fee is not sufficient to cover the cost of teaching). However, it is also possible that some HE providers may choose to continue offering these foundation years at current levels, for example by cross subsidising the losses on this provision with surpluses generated by other activities or by finding ways to reduce delivery costs. </p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>On the demand side, the response of students is more ambiguous. Lowering tuition fees for classroom-based foundation years may encourage more students to enrol on this provision as they perceive the cost of study and the level of debt they would need to take out, to be lower. Conversely, some students may be discouraged from taking up classroom-based foundation years if they perceive lower fees to be a signal of lower quality or poorer outcomes. We think the behavioural response of students to any change in fee levels is likely to be minimal. This is because HE students are assumed to be price insensitive with available evidence showing that prospective students consider a range of price and non-price factors when making decisions about whether to go to university and evidence shows that tuition fees/course costs are not the most influential factor.<authorialNote marker="15"><p> <a href="https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR571.html"><u>https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR571.html</u></a></p></authorialNote>,<authorialNote marker="16"><p> <a href="http://ftp.iza.org/dp8364.pdf"><u>http://ftp.iza.org/dp8364.pdf</u></a> </p></authorialNote>,<authorialNote marker="17"><p> <a href="https://ifs.org.uk/sites/default/files/output_url_files/wp1117.pdf"><u>https://ifs.org.uk/sites/default/files/output_url_files/wp1117.pdf</u></a> </p></authorialNote></p>

          <p>Overall, we do not expect this policy to significantly reduce the number of people entering HE. This is because we expect prospective students who would otherwise have chosen a classroom-based foundation year to either choose to undertake functionally similar courses (such as AHE Diplomas) or enter directly into year 1 where they are able to do so. Either choice will lead to lower levels of student loan debt and reduced costs for taxpayers.</p>

        <content>
          <p>The intended effects and outcomes of lowering tuition fees and loan limits can be considered specific, measurable, achievable, realistic and time-limited (SMART). The policy objective is specifically targeted at stemming the rapid expansion in classroom-based foundation years. The impact of the policy will be possible to measure by reviewing data on the number of students enrolling onto classroom-based foundation years after the policy has been implemented. A reduction in these numbers, plateauing, or a contraction in the rate of growth compared to previous years, would indicate that the policy has had its intended impact. Delivery discussions with the Student Loans Company (SLC) have confirmed that the policy is deliverable, and engagement with HE providers has indicated that many will scale back their provision of classroom-based foundation years, meaning that the objectives of the policy are<i> </i>realistic. We expect the policy to have an immediate and lasting impact, due to a sustained reduction in funding for classroom-based foundation years.</p>

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>A key measure of success will be change to the rapid growth in the supply of classroom-based foundation years offered by HE providers, on the assumption that the lower tuition fee will reduce the financial incentive for HE providers to continue delivering foundation years in classroom-based subjects at current levels. In academic year 2025/26, our minimal expectation is to see growth in student enrolments onto classroom-based foundation years reflect the overall growth rate for year 1 entry. Growth has already slowed down in academic year 2022/23, with a growth of only 4% from academic year 2021/22. </p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>We would also expect to see a reduction in the cost to students, either as result of students choosing foundation years at the lower fee rate, or because students choose alternative routes for access to HE (e.g. via AHE Diplomas or direct entry into year 1). Additionally, monetary savings from this policy will extend to government and taxpayers due to a reduction in the amount of student loan outlay for classroom-based foundation years.</p>

        <content>
          <p>The consultation received 298 responses to the written questions, including from HE providers, HE mission groups, HE sector representative bodies, arm’s length and professional bodies, student representative bodies, and individuals. Views gathered on foundation years showed a slight preference of opinion against the department’s proposal: 43% of respondents agreed that foundation year fee limits should be reduced, while 57% disagreed. The majority of HE providers that responded disagreed that foundation year fee limits should be reduced, whereas a majority of individuals, student mission groups, and further education providers that responded agreed with the proposed reduction.<b> </b>Of the 183 respondents who commented on whether there was a case for allowing foundation years in some subjects to charge a higher tuition fee, just under two thirds disagreed with this proposal, with HE providers more likely to disagree compared to other respondents.<authorialNote marker="19"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reform-consultation-analysis-research-report"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-reform-consultation-analysis-research-report</u></a> </p></authorialNote></p>

This proposal was deemed to represent a fair compromise between maintaining the viability of higher cost foundation year provision — so that it can continue to widen access to HE — and ensuring that students can access lower cost foundation years provision at a fairer fee, where provision can be delivered more efficiently. </p>

          <p>Under the preferred option (Option 1), the maximum fee and loan limit for foundation years in classroom-based subjects (currently in OfS Price Group D) will be lowered to £5,760 while the maximum fee and loan limit for foundation years in all other subjects will remain aligned with the maximum fee limit for standard full-time undergraduate courses (due to increase to £9,535 for the 2025/26 academic year).

          <p>The £5,760 lower fee limit was chosen to align with the highest standard funding rate for AHE Diplomas, which are functionally similar to foundation years. AHE Diplomas are priced at five different rates and can be funded via grant funding or Advanced Learner Loans. The department considered aligning the lower fee limit with the lowest base funding rate for AHE Diplomas, which would have produced a lower fee limit of £3,600. It also considered aligning the lower fee with the highest specialist funding rate, which would have produced a lower fee limit of £7,200. £3,600 was considered to be too low and could have had an overly detrimental impact on the provision of foundation years and on HE sector finances. Research into the cost of foundation years provision also found no evidence that they could be delivered for this amount.<authorialNote marker="21"><p> <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1170788/Understanding_the_costs_of_foundation_years_study_research_report.pdf"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1170788/Understanding_the_costs_of_foundation_years_study_research_report.pdf</u></a> </p></authorialNote> The £7,200 limit was deemed too high, representing an insufficient reduction in funding, unlikely to stem the disproportionate growth of foundation years in classroom-based subjects. The specialist AHE rate also applies to a small number of subjects (e.g. agriculture and music) which do not sit within the scope of classroom-based subjects, which the £5,760 fee limit will apply to.</p>

          <p>Since the policy was originally announced on 17 July 2023, HE providers have had some time to plan and prepare for these changes, including experimenting, piloting and/or trialling different ways of delivering foundation year provision with the reduced fee limit. The department also published guidance on 9 May 2024 to help HE providers prepare for these changes.<authorialNote marker="22"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-tuition-fees-for-foundation-years"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/higher-education-tuition-fees-for-foundation-years</u></a></p></authorialNote> The regulations do not seek to place any undue constraints on the ability of HE providers to develop, test and roll-out different forms of foundation year provision. They simply seek to impose new lower fee limits for some foundation years which can be implemented within existing course design and registration processes.</p>

          <p>In May 2019, the Independent Panel (chaired by Sir Philip Augar) that supported the Review of Post-18 Education and Funding recommended withdrawing financial support for all foundation years attached to degree courses, with exemptions for specific courses such as medicine.<authorialNote marker="23"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/post-18-review-of-education-and-funding-independent-panel-report"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/post-18-review-of-education-and-funding-independent-panel-report</u></a> </p></authorialNote> The previous government rejected this option, concluding that absolute removal of foundation years’ funding would have a detrimental impact on access to HE – particularly for students from underrepresented backgrounds. </p>

This option was also rejected, and the department commissioned further research from IFF Research into the delivery costs of foundation years.<authorialNote marker="25"><p> <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64b16c60995900000d002b25/Understanding_the_costs_of_foundation_years_study_research_report.pdf"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64b16c60995900000d002b25/Understanding_the_costs_of_foundation_years_study_research_report.pdf</u></a> </p></authorialNote> This research found some evidence to suggest that a proportion of classroom-based subjects were being delivered for less than the current maximum fee limit of £9,250.

Recruitment limits for foundation years was discounted on the basis that the OfS’ B3 metrics – used to apply recruitment limits – already cover courses with foundation years, and a more punitive system of recruitment limits disregards the important role of foundation years in widening access and participation to HE. Minimum Eligibility Requirements for foundation years were also discounted on similar grounds. To widen access to HE, it is often necessary for foundation years to be available with lower entry requirements, and providers must retain the ability to consider non-traditional entry qualifications when offering foundation year places.  </p>

          <p>Option 2 was rejected due to concern that this could negatively impact the ability of students from underrepresented groups to access HE, particularly in higher-cost subjects that are important to the future skills needs of the UK economy. This was on the basis that lowering foundation year tuition fees across all subjects would make those subjects which are more expensive to teach (e.g. medicine, dentistry and STEM) financially unviable to the point that HE providers could withdraw them.<authorialNote marker="27"><p> <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64b16c60995900000d002b25/Understanding_the_costs_of_foundation_years_study_research_report.pdf"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/64b16c60995900000d002b25/Understanding_the_costs_of_foundation_years_study_research_report.pdf</u></a> </p></authorialNote></p>

          <p>Option 3 was rejected on affordability grounds in that it would be costly for the taxpayer compared to other options since it would require higher levels of direct grant funding to cover the shortfall in funding for courses in higher cost and strategically important subjects (such as medicine, dentistry and STEM).</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Option 4 was rejected because it was deemed highly unlikely that HE providers would take the necessary action themselves to reduce tuition fees for foundation years so that they are more aligned with alternative, further education options such as AHE Diplomas. This is because HE providers have a clear incentive to set higher tuition fees for their courses; firstly, to cover the rising cost of teaching, and secondly, to signal that their courses are of high quality. A non-regulatory option based on providing better information to students on foundation years and AHE Diplomas was also rejected because it was deemed unlikely to be effective. Even with better information for students, HE providers would be unlikely to reduce tuition fees voluntarily, meaning that students who continue to study classroom-based foundation years would still be paying higher fees. </p>

As such, the two sets of financial impacts estimates are not directly comparable and should not be aggregated to estimate the combined financial impact of both policies on HE providers.

            <p>Income loss estimations exclude four providers (78 vs 82) with entrants for classroom-based foundation years due to incomplete finance data. A review of the non-financial characteristics of excluded providers does not suggest a distortion of the remaining provider data as a result.</p>

            <p>The percentage decrease in total income under Scenario 2 (maximum) of the preferred option is overstated. This is because Scenario 2 forecasts high student growth up to and including academic year 2025/26, but as total income has not been forecasted, does not account for increases in tuition fee revenue from student growth.</p>

          <p>Whilst reductions in income are concentrated around low-tariff and specialist (other) providers, there is significant variation within tariff groupings. Furthermore, providers of foundation years vary year-on-year, with five providers in academic year 2021/22 not admitting entrants for impacted courses in academic year 2022/23. Therefore, the overall impact to total income for providers listed within Table 4 is unlikely to capture the variation in impact at a provider level. </p>

          <p>All OfS registered HE providers, excluding Further Education Colleges (FECs), are required to submit data on academic staff to HESA. However, the return of data on non-academic staff became voluntary submission from academic year 2019/20 onwards. Given that not all HE providers reported their non-academic staff numbers for academic year 2022/23, we have calculated a ratio of academic/non-academic staff in academic year 2018/19 (when the data was last complete) to estimate non-academic staff numbers for providers which did not provide complete data for academic year 2022/23.</p>

          <p>Small-sized providers will not be exempt from the lower tuition fee limit to ensure all HE providers are treated equally under this policy. We want classroom-based foundation years to represent better value for money for students and taxpayers, regardless of where they are studied. DfE’s analysis does not suggest this policy will have a disproportionate financial impact on small-sized HE providers. As Table 5 shows, only one small-sized provider offered classroom-based foundation years in academic year 2022/23, with the financial effect of the reform estimated to be lower than the average annual income loss of all impacted providers.</p>

          <p>The impact on medium-sized providers appears to be significantly higher than both the estimated impact on small-sized providers and overall average. Whilst comparisons to small-sized providers should be avoided due to the very small sample size; the more significant impact on medium-sized providers is primarily due to two providers with exceptionally high estimated annual income loss (9.94% to 20.66%). Excluding these two providers aligns the average for medium-sized (1.90% to 2.43%) and all classroom-based foundation year providers.</p>

        <content>
          <p>Overall, our analysis does not indicate a disproportionate financial impact on providers due to provider size or tariff grouping. Rather, changes in income post-reform will be driven by the prominence of foundation years within undergraduate courses, and the split between classroom and non-classroom-based foundation years. In the case of the two medium-sized providers with exceptionally high estimated annual income losses, classroom-based subjects accounted for 97-100% of foundation year enrolments in academic year 2022/23. </p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">As the change in tuition fee limits for classroom-based foundation years does not affect the way in which a HE provider carries out its teaching, research and related activities, we do not believe this measure will limit the ability of providers, or their incentives, to compete. Since the proposed changes to maximum tuition fees apply to all Approved (fee cap) HE providers (which account for most students) we do not believe that the proposed change will affect students’ ability to engage with the sector and make choices that align with their preferences.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">It is possible the lower tuition fee for classroom-based subjects could strengthen providers’ incentives to introduce new technologies, products or business models which lower the cost of teaching and improve the efficiency of their activities. However, the ability of providers to exploit potential opportunities may depend on the extent to which it has sufficient financial resources available to fund the necessary investment.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">While lowering tuition fee limits for classroom-based foundation year provision only directly affects UK domiciled students, there could be an indirect positive impact on trade and investment if providers switch to recruiting more international students as a way of offsetting the lower tuition fee income they receive from domestic foundation year students. This is because expenditure by international students on tuition fees is treated as an export in the national accounts as it represents spending in the country by a non-UK resident</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">It is possible that lower levels of tuition fee income from foundation year provision could result in some HE providers having to delay or pause necessary expenditure on maintaining the campus grounds (which can include natural areas and playing fields), and investment aimed at improving the energy performance and sustainability of their buildings (some of which may be energy inefficient because of their age) as well as lowering the overall level of carbon emissions and waste generated by the HE provider’s academic facilities and residences. </p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">However, we believe the potential risk and impact to be highly uncertain. This is because tuition fees from classroom-based foundation years will account for a small proportion of the total income and funding that HE providers receive. Furthermore, HE providers are independent, autonomous institutions which are responsible for managing their assets (including the capital estate) and for making their owns decisions about how to spend the income they receive from tuition fees.</p>

          <p>In line with the Better Regulation Framework, the department will undertake a post-implementation review in 2028 at the earliest. Given the reduction in maximum fee and loan limits will not come into force until academic year 2025/26, and there is a lag in the publication of data necessary to conduct such a review, a review in 2028 will provide an assessment of at least two academic years (2025/26, 2026/27).  This will enable DfE to evaluate the initial impact of the reform on student enrolment growth, and the availability of provision by both price group and provider.</p>

      <level>
        <heading>As part of this post-implementation review, we will examine the following questions: </heading>

          <num>•</num>
          <content>
            <p><b>Has the number of classroom-based foundation years decreased?</b> DfE’s expectation is that foundation years subject to the new fee and loan limit will either be reduced or will stop expanding, relative to the pre-reform period. DfE will also assess the significance of this change (i.e. did the reform have a clear influencing role on provider behaviour?), and how the availability of provision compares to foundation years in higher cost subjects.</p>

          <num>•</num>
          <content>
            <p><b>Has the number of students on foundation years in classroom-based subjects decreased?</b> DfE’s expectation is for a decline in the number of students studying classroom-based foundation years. We will also assess how changes in student enrolments compare to higher cost foundation years, and classroom-based degrees without a foundation year (i.e. direct entry enrolment). Furthermore, assuming a decline in student enrolment, we will endeavour to identify what pathway students, who would have undertaken a classroom-based foundation year in the absence of this reform, transition onto (e.g. direct entry into year 1, AHE diplomas, etc.).</p>

          <content>
            <p><b>Has the reform indirectly affected the availability of foundation years in higher cost and strategically important subjects, and/or the number of students on them?</b> DfE does not anticipate a decrease in availability for foundation years not subject to the reduction in fee and loan limits for classroom-based subjects. However, we recognise the significant reduction in fees for classroom-based foundation years, coupled with the small increase to the maximum fee and loan limit for all other courses, may elicit a behavioural response from potential entrants and providers of higher cost courses. </p>

            <p><b>Has the number of students sharing protected and other student characteristics disproportionately declined?</b> Whilst DfE expects a decline in student enrolment, we do not anticipate a disproportionate impact on students from underrepresented groups, particularly in their ability to access HE. Regardless, we will monitor if changes to students across protected characteristics are aligned with the expectations outlined within the equalities impact assessment which is being published separately.</p>

            <p><b>Has the reform impacted student outcomes for foundation year provision?</b><b> </b>A primary objective of this policy is to realign the expansion of enrolment and provision of classroom-based foundation years with similar courses at the direct entry level (year 1). Whilst this may likely result in a decline in student enrolment and courses, we do not anticipate a decline in student outcomes, given sufficient alternative pathways and the expectation of increased direct entry offers. Nonetheless, we will monitor student progression and completion rates (published annually by the OfS), as well as student outcomes at the individual provider level. Due to the lag between entry, course completion and data publication of at least four years for full-time students, we will only be able to look at progression (onto year 1) at the time of our post-implementation review.</p>

          <p>Administrative burdens of complying with this regulation are assessed to be low. The regulation is related to tuition fee loans and limits. The regulation itself does not directly affect the roles and responsibilities of HE providers or the activities that they carry out. There may be some indirect administrative burden on HE providers to update their website or other documents with information on the new fee loans and limits, however, we do not see this as additional, as HE providers are assumed to check and update their websites and documentation each year when fee information is confirmed. </p>
