                <p class="ia-table-text"><b>What is the problem under consideration? Why is Government intervention necessary?</b></p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">The pension freedoms were introduced in April 2015 to allow individuals greater choice in how and when they accessed their pension benefits. When they were introduced, the government put protections in place to ensure that individuals with “safeguarded benefits” (pension benefits with certain potentially valuable guarantees), who wished to access the freedoms did not surrender these without first being aware of their value. To this end, individuals with safeguarded benefits valued at over £30,000 are currently required to take financial advice before they can access their pension flexibly. However, representations from providers have made the government aware that for certain kinds of safeguarded benefits, known as “safeguarded-<i>flexible</i> benefits”, the current valuation method set in legislation for determining whether advice is required is complex and confusing for both members and schemes. Government intervention is therefore required to simplify this process. In addition, there is a general lack of awareness amongst members of the value of the guarantees associated with safeguarded-flexible benefits and additional government intervention is required to correct this on-going information failure.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">The government intends to change the rules around the valuation process that is used to assess whether someone is required to seek financial advice. This will mean that schemes can use a simpler, more established process for valuing safeguarded-flexible benefits. The aim is to reduce the burden on schemes, and confusion for members. However, it is important that individuals with safeguarded-flexible benefits understand that their pension benefits offer potentially valuable guarantees of the option of a secure income at retirement, and the implications of giving them up. Therefore, while the policy will simplify the current processes by which schemes comply with the rules requiring members take financial advice (the advice requirement), resulting in some members no longer being required to take advice, it also seeks to ensure that all individuals who have safeguarded-flexible benefits – regardless of pot size – are well-informed of their value (through risk-warnings) before they make the decision to transfer or convert those benefits and so give up any associated guarantees.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">• Option 2: Simplify advice requirements for safeguarded pensions benefits so that the £30,000 threshold for seeking advice is based on the transfer value of the pension pot (as opposed to the amount required to provide for the member’s accrued benefits), and introduce a new requirement for firms to provide tailored communications (risk warnings) for members’ with safeguarded-flexible benefits, when they seek to transfer, convert or otherwise flexibly access their pension savings (e.g. a cash-payment from their pension scheme). This is the preferred option.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">The option of simplifying the advice requirement without introducing risk warnings for safeguarded-flexible benefits has been considered but rejected as this will not meet the policy objective of ensuring that all members are well-informed about their value. Those with a pot valued at £30,000 or less might not be informed about the value of the benefits at any point before surrendering them. Recent Pensions Ombudsman cases have suggested a significant lack of awareness about these benefits, and a majority of responses to the Government’s Call for Evidence on the subject favoured members being better informed about their guarantees and their value. </p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">A non-regulatory approach is not viable for the change to the valuation process. The current rules for assessing the value of safeguarded pension benefits are already in regulation, so to change these further regulatory amendments are required.  A non-regulatory approach is also not appropriate for the risk warnings; producing tailored communications informing members of the value of their guarantees represents a cost to providers, so there is a risk that some providers may not comply, and as the payment of guarantees, irrespective of investment market returns, presents a financial liability for firms, there may be an incentive for providers not to inform members of the value of their guarantees before they are given up.  Furthermore, if any providers do not comply with a voluntary code, the policy would not fulfil the key objective that all individuals with valuable guarantees are told they have these valuable guarantees and their value, before they proceed with a decision that will result in them being given up.  When asked in the Government’s Call for Evidence whether a voluntary solution was feasible, a majority of responders favoured risk warnings being a statutory requirement. </p>

The costs of valuing safeguarded-flexible benefits, particularly those that offer the member option of a Guaranteed Annuity Rates (GARs) have been higher than was originally anticipated as the complexity of applying the valuation method set in regulation was not foreseen.

We have used as a proxy the number of pension policies which offer  members, whilst they are accumulating their pension benefits, a guaranteed rate at which they can convert their fund into a pension income at retirement, referred to here as GAR benefits. We only have data on GAR benefits and  we are not aware of any available data showing the incidence of other safeguarded-flexible benefits<authorialNote marker="3"><p class="ia-table-text"><b> Other examples of where a benefit is safeguarded and flexible that are not GARs are </b><b>cases where an occupational pension scheme offers members an option to purchase a scheme pension on the basis of pre-determined conversion factors</b><b>.  </b></p></authorialNote>. However, we understand from insights from industry consultation that GARs are by far the most common type of safeguarded-flexible benefits in scope of this policy. Therefore, we expect that data on GARs will be a reasonable proxy for safeguarded-flexible benefits as a whole.  This assumption was tested in the impact assessment accompanying the consultation in September 2016. There were no concerns raised by stakeholders that the  safeguarded-flexible benefits which are not GARs would have a significant impact on the costing of this policy change. However, we have carried out sensitivity analysis around  this assumption..                            </p>
                  <p class="ia-table-text">There is also uncertainty around the frequency that individuals with GARs will enquire about giving them up by accessing their safeguarded benefit flexibly and the costs associated with the current valuation method for determining whether advice is required. Where there is uncertainty, we have sought to use the most appropriate data sources currently available including asking pension providers to provide estimates of costs involved.  We have also carried out sensitivity analysis  on the most uncertain assumptions; results are presented in the ‘Risk and Assumptions’ section.</p>

In the 6 month period before the policy comes into force and the short period after the policy coming into force, providers will incur costs in adhering to transitional arrangements. The gross costs to businesses are estimated to be £3.41 million in the first year and £1.15 million per year in subsequent years. </p>

In addition, they will also no longer need to check that advice has been sought by certain members. Gross savings are estimated at £1.66m in the first year and £3.33m in  subsequent years.</p>

                  <p class="ia-table-text">There is uncertainty over the number of pension policies with safeguarded-flexible benefits, that is, safeguarded benefits that are not traditional salary-related (for instance final salary) pensions. We have used as a proxy the number of pension policies which offer  members, whilst they are accumulating their pension benefits, a guaranteed rate at which they can convert their fund into a pension income at retirement, referred to here as GAR benefits. We only have data on GAR benefits and  we are not aware of any available data showing the incidence of other safeguarded-flexible benefits. However, we understand from insights from the industry that GARs are by far the most common type of safeguarded-flexible benefits in scope of this policy. Therefore, we expect that data on GARs will be a reasonable proxy for safeguarded-flexible benefits as a whole.  This assumption was tested in the impact assessment accompanying the consultation in September 2016. There were no concerns raised by stakeholders that the  safeguarded-flexible benefits which are not GARs would have a significant impact on the costing of this policy change. However, we have carried out sensitivity analysis around  this assumption.                             </p>
                  <p class="ia-table-text">There is also uncertainty around the frequency that individuals with GARs will enquire about giving them up by accessing their safeguarded benefit flexibly and the cost of implementing the new risk warning requirement. Where there is uncertainty, we have sought to use the most appropriate data sources currently available including asking pension providers to provide estimates of costs involved.  We have also carried out sensitivity analysis  on the most uncertain assumptions; results are presented in the ‘Risk and Assumptions’ section.</p>

            <p>Safeguarded benefits include traditional salary-related occupational pensions and some other (primarily contract-based) pensions (known as safeguarded-<i>flexible</i> benefits) where the member is guaranteed a particular level of secure pension income, or has an option to take or purchase a pension or annuity calculated at a guaranteed rate.</p>

            <p>The most common types of safeguarded-flexible benefits are those with Guaranteed Annuity Rates (GARs). The member with a GAR has an option to purchase an annuity at a contractually guaranteed rate at retirement, or on reaching a particular age. The term GAR is used in the following discussion and the monetisation of costs and benefits to describe safeguarded-flexible benefits<authorialNote marker="5"><p> An impact assessment was published alongside the consultation in September 2016: (<a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/555566/draft-impact-assessment-simplifying-advice-requirements-for-safeguarded-pension-benefits-and-introducing-new-consumer-protections.pdf"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/555566/draft-impact-assessment-simplifying-advice-requirements-for-safeguarded-pension-benefits-and-introducing-new-consumer-protections.pdf</u></a>). This stated that:</p><p> “There is uncertainty over the number of pension policies with safeguarded-flexible benefits, that is, safeguarded benefits that are not traditional salary-related (for instance final salary) pensions. We have used as a proxy the number of pension policies which offer members, whilst they are accumulating their pension benefits, a guaranteed rate at which they can convert their fund into a pension income at retirement, because we only have data on GARs and are not aware of any available data showing the incidence of other safeguarded-flexible benefits. We understand from insights from the industry that GARs are by far the most common type of safeguarded-flexible benefits in scope of this policy and therefore expect that data on GARs will be a reasonable proxy for safeguarded-flexible benefits as a whole.”   </p><p>There were no responses or concerns raised at either the round table event or within consultation responses that this was not a realistic assumption.  Therefore, even though it is acknowledged that there may be a small number of safeguarded-flexible benefits that are not GARs which are impacted by this policy change – meaning the costs and benefits might be slightly understated - we believe this will only be a small impact. This is explored further in the sensitivity analysis; see the Risks and Assumptions section.</p><p /></authorialNote>. </p>

            <p>Since April 2015, schemes have been required to value safeguarded benefits (including GARs) using the method for calculating cash equivalents of salary-related occupational pensions under the Occupational Pension Schemes (Transfer Value) Regulations 1996.  This methodology requires benefits to be valued by determining the amount required to make provision within the scheme for the benefits. Schemes and providers offering GARs are required to calculate the amount needed to provide for the GAR in order to identify whether the member is required to take financial advice. </p>

            <p>The pension freedoms were introduced in April 2015 to allow individuals to flexibly access their pension savings. Alongside this, the government introduced a consumer protection for members with valuable guarantees of a secure pension income (safeguarded benefits) because giving greater choice about how and when members accessed their pension benefits significantly increased the appeal of accessing safeguarded benefits flexibly. The detailed requirements which apply to schemes and providers when members seek to transfer, convert or otherwise flexibly access safeguarded benefits are set out in The Pension Schemes Act 2015 (Transitional Provisions and Appropriate Independent Advice) Regulations 2015<authorialNote marker="11"><p> SI 2015/742</p></authorialNote>. </p>

            <p>As GARs constitute a guarantee regarding the rate of pension income a member can secure, they were categorised as a safeguarded benefit. It is especially important to make members aware of the benefits of GARs as they are found in pension schemes which otherwise look identical to schemes without any guarantees. This results in an information failure, where individuals lack full information about the fact that they have a GAR or of the conditions or value attached to it – for example due to the long term and complex nature of pensions contracts and a lighter disclosure and regulatory regime at the time consumers took out these benefits. </p>

            <p>To ensure that individuals are fully informed before potentially giving up their GAR by accessing the pension freedoms, the government’s safeguards require that individuals with benefits that contain a GAR valued at more than £30,000 seek financial advice. This is so they understand the implications of continuing with any decision that would result in them surrendering their GAR. However, the methodology currently set in legislation for determining the value of a member’s GAR has put an excessive burden on schemes. Government intervention is therefore required to simplify the valuation process for assessing the value of members’ ‘GAR benefits’ to reduce unnecessary burdens on pension schemes and providers. </p>

            <p>However, not all members with pension benefits that contain a GAR will be covered by the advice requirement; those with a GAR valued at less than £30,000 are exempt as it would be disproportionate for those with very small pots to be required to seek and pay for FCA regulated financial advice. This means that, despite the advice requirement, there is still an on-going information failure whereby some individuals may not understand their GAR and the value it represents when making a decision about whether to make use of the pension freedoms<authorialNote marker="12"><p> Responses to the government’s Call for Evidence on the Valuation of Pensions with a Guaranteed Annuity Rate<b> </b>raised concerns that members are often not fully aware of the potential value of GARs attached to their pension benefits. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/505678/government-response-misc-regs-consultation-23-nov-2015-and-call-for-evidence-on-gar-valuation.pdf"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/505678/government-response-misc-regs-consultation-23-nov-2015-and-call-for-evidence-on-gar-valuation.pdf</u></a>. Similarly, cases brought to the attention of the Financial Ombudsman have shown that individuals do not always have complete information about their GAR – e.g. <a href="http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/publications/ombudsman-news/115/115-annuities.html"><u>http://www.financial-ombudsman.org.uk/publications/ombudsman-news/115/115-annuities.html</u></a></p></authorialNote>. Furthermore, the proposed simplification of the valuation process for pensions with GARs for the purpose of the advice requirement will mean that some members with GARs who previously would have received the protection of being required to take FCA regulated financial advice will no longer have to seek financial advice. Therefore, additional government intervention is required in order to make sure that all individuals understand the value of their GAR and can make an informed decision, even if they are not required to seek FCA regulated financial advice.</p>

            <p>The government intends to amend the valuation process for safeguarded benefits. This will have the effect of simplifying the calculation method used to value members’ GAR benefits. For the purpose of determining whether members are required to take financial advice and in the case the safeguarded benefit is flexible, schemes can calculate the realisable transfer value of a member’s benefits, rather than carrying out a different more complicated calculation to assess who is required to seek financial advice. The realisable transfer value is an established and widely used calculation methodology. The aim is to reduce the burden on schemes.  </p>

            <p>The policy to simplify the advice requirement will remove the requirement for some individuals to take financial advice. However, it remains important that these individuals and all other individuals with GARs are informed that their pension contains valuable guarantees before they give them up.  Therefore, the policy should also ensure that all individuals with GARs are informed both that their pension contains potentially valuable guarantees, and of the value of those guarantees, before they proceed with any decision to transfer, convert or otherwise flexibly access their pension pot, and thereby give up their GAR.</p>

However, this means those below the advice requirement threshold (whose safeguarded-flexible benefits are valued at £30,000 or less) may not have clear information about the potential value of their guarantees, before they decide to give up their GAR by accessing their pension flexibly. Members with a pot size in excess of the £30,000 threshold will still benefit from information about the GAR before they make a decision to incur the costs of regulated financial advice.

              <p>It would require all providers to adhere to a voluntary code - but informing individuals about their GARs would represent a cost to providers and so there is a risk that some providers will not comply. Compliant providers would incur costs in producing disclosure material, whilst non-compliant providers would incur a cost-saving. Furthermore payment of guarantees, irrespective of investment market returns, presents a financial liability for providers. There is an implicit incentive not to voluntarily inform members before they give up their GAR-benefits. There is therefore a risk that some consumers would not be informed of the value of their guarantee before they gave it up. </p>

              <p>There will be a significant cohort of GAR holders approaching, or already at an age, at which they can access the pension freedoms. Standardised and comparable risk warnings, including projections, may be expected to achieve faster and more complete consumer protection. The development and implementation of a voluntary approach may risk delay, and therefore incomplete coverage, just as this cohort reach retirement. </p>

              <p>Option 1: Do nothing. This would mean providers and schemes will continue to be required to carry out the complex calculation. Certain members with GARs will be required to seek financial advice, and providers will have to check that they have received financial advice, but providers will not have to supply information on the value of the GAR to other members. </p>

              <p>Option 2: Simplify advice requirements for pensions with GARs, basing the current £30,000 threshold at which members are required to take advice on the transfer value of the benefits, rather than the existing calculation of the future income the GAR could provide. Also introduce a requirement for providers to provide personalised risk warnings to all members with GARs.</p>

            <p>Overall the measure would represent a net benefit to businesses over a ten year period. There will be costs to pension providers in familiarisation with the new rules, producing and sending the new risk warnings and complying with transitional arrangements. These costs will be outweighed by the benefits from pension providers no longer having to do complex valuations to determine advice requirements for individuals with GARs and no longer having to check that advice requirements for certain members have been fulfilled.</p>

            <p>There will be a benefit to members from the provision of fuller information about the value of their GAR at the point when they are making a decision which may result in those guarantees being surrendered. Receiving the risk warning at this point will allow individuals to make more informed decisions when planning their retirement. This benefit has not been monetised.</p>

              <p>The TPR Governance Survey estimate volumes of GARs offered for trust-based schemes.  However, a significant proportion of benefits with GARs in occupational schemes will not be affected by these changes because they fall within the definition of “money purchase benefits” and so are not safeguarded benefits. This is the case where the GAR is a feature of an insurance policy held as an asset of the scheme, rather than being promised in the scheme rules. Therefore these money purchase GARs need to be excluded from our analysis. Although it is understood that a significant proportion of GARs in trust-based schemes may be money purchase GARs, there is no robust data on this point. As a central estimate, we have assumed that only 50% of the GARs in the survey are non-money purchase; this leaves 549 trust-based schemes, made up of 140 non-micro schemes and 409 micro schemes. Given the lack of evidence around what proportion of trust-based GARs are non-money purchase, we have conducted sensitivity analysis around this assumption (see Risks and Assumptions section). This shows that the overall costs and benefits are not sensitive to this assumption.</p>

              <p>We do not have equivalent data showing the number of individuals with GARs in trust-based schemes who have given up their GAR.  The evidence on the prevalence of GARs in trust-based pension schemes is limited to the data on the number of schemes with GARs, split by scheme size (from TPR’s governance survey<authorialNote marker="24"><p> TPR Governance Survey 2014,<u> </u><a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150703133738/http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/docs/governance-survey-report-2014.pdf"><u>http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150703133738/http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/docs/governance-survey-report-2014.pdf</u></a> <u> </u></p></authorialNote>). We use this to estimate the number of members with GARs, by multiplying the estimated number of small, medium and large schemes with GARs by the average number of members (from TPR data<authorialNote marker="25"><p> TPR scheme returns data 2016/17, <u> </u><u>http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/doc-library/dc-trust-presentation-of-scheme-return-data-2017.aspx</u></p></authorialNote>).

              <p>This estimate only covers those who have actually given up their GAR. It does not account for those who may have enquired about accessing their pot but then decided not to at that time. In this way, these volumes may under-estimate the number of people for whom the advice requirement calculation is currently required and for whom risk warnings will be required. In order to estimate what proportion of those who enquire about accessing their GAR go on to give up their GAR, we asked a number of providers for information. Two providers responded; we have used an average of their responses, which suggests that 62.5% of those enquiring about accessing their pension subsequently go on to access it<authorialNote marker="29"><p> This is also supported by similar figures published by FCA in their Data Bulletin Issue 7 (<a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/data/data-bulletin-issue-7"><u>https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/data/data-bulletin-issue-7</u></a>). They show that, of those accessing their pension, 63% in Q4 2015 and 61% in Q1 2016 gave up their GAR; the remainder took up their GAR. The statistics are not directly comparable as they <i>will not</i> capture those who enquired about accessing their GAR but then took no action, i.e. did not give up their GAR or take up their GAR (but still would have required a risk warning), and they <i>will</i> include any individuals who chose to take up their GAR without asking about other flexible options (and so would not have required a risk warning). </p></authorialNote>. Since the 38,201 members only includes those who actually give up their GAR, we have up-rated by 1.6 in line with discussion with providers and assumed that 61,122 members per year would enquire about accessing their GAR<authorialNote marker="30"><p> This is made up of 57,005 members in contract-based schemes and 4,117 members in trust-based schemes.</p></authorialNote>.</p>

            <p>The transfer value of the benefits is a well-understood concept, as it is the amount which the scheme would pay to the member’s receiving scheme when they transferred. Therefore the time needed for familiarisation is expected to be fairly short. We have assumed that a pension professional from each of the 565 schemes and providers with GARs will need to read and digest around two pages of guidance<authorialNote marker="31"><p> This may over-estimate the number of trust-based schemes who face familiarisation costs as the TPR data (TPR Governance Survey 2014,<u> </u><a href="http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150703133738/http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/docs/governance-survey-report-2014.pdf"><u>http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20150703133738/http://www.thepensionsregulator.gov.uk/docs/governance-survey-report-2014.pdf</u></a> ) shows that small schemes are more likely to have GARs and in these schemes the work of familiarisation and implementing changes will typically be carried out by an administrator or another other service provider. In practice many schemes use the same service provider, so the number of distinct firms who need to familiarise themselves with the change would likely be less than 565. Furthermore, this estimate includes 409 trust-based micro schemes; these schemes will have a very low number of members with GARs and, in any one year, only a minority are likely to have a member who wishes to give up their GAR. Given the infrequency that schemes will be required to understand these rules, arguably they are likely to only familiarise themselves if and when the need arises.</p></authorialNote>.

This data only covers contract-based schemes, but in the absence of an equivalent breakdown by pot size for trust-based pensions, we have applied it to the number of GAR holders expected to enquire about accessing their GARs, across both trust-based and contract-based schemes (61,122).

This is based on taking an average from estimates of the cost provided by pension schemes in response to a request for information from DWP<authorialNote marker="35"><p> When asked for a rough indication of the unit cost of valuing a GAR, two providers responded, giving a range of estimates: one estimated a cost of £50 per transaction; the other estimated £250-£400 per transaction. In the absence of any better data, we have used a mid-point.</p></authorialNote>. Therefore we estimate that the total savings to businesses from no longer being required to calculate the value of GARs for those seeking to transfer, convert or otherwise flexibly access their benefits is around £3,090,000 per year.</p>

            <p>There will be additional savings to providers and schemes as at present they are required to check whether advice has been taken by all those who are required to do so. As the advice threshold will now be based on the transfer value of the pot, not taking into account the value of the GAR, those individuals whose GAR is worth more than £30,000 but whose transfer value is £30,000 or less will no longer be required to seek advice. </p>

Insight from providers suggests that the annuity rates offered by GARs tend to be around double the typical annual rate for annuities.

In practice many schemes use the same service provider, so the number of distinct firms who need to familiarise themselves with the change would likely be less than 565. Furthermore, this estimate includes 409 trust-based micro schemes; these schemes will have a very low number of members with GARs and, in any one year, only a minority are likely to have a member who wishes to give up their GAR. Given the infrequency that schemes will be required to understand these rules, arguably they are likely to only familiarise themselves if and when the need arises. </p></authorialNote>.

A number of contract-based providers responded.

            <p>Providers’ responses also suggested a preference for more flexibility. Schemes requested the flexibility to use FCA’s methodology when producing income projections as part of GAR risk warnings. Allowing schemes the freedom to choose their own methodology would mean significantly lower upfront costs than if a different approach had to be adopted for the GAR risk warnings. In response to these representations, we have adapted the regulations so that schemes can choose their preferred methodology; this will help ensure that the added member protection introduced by the risk warnings can be implemented without putting an undue burden on the pensions industry.</p>

            <p>The responses suggested that, even after allowing providers to follow the FCA methodology, upfront costs would be higher than we had initially estimated. We received estimates from four providers. However, the responses varied significantly, ranging from £50,000-65,000 to £450,000. This suggests that the costs of implementing system changes to enable the production of the risk warnings are highly dependent on how the particular systems are set up and how easily they can be changed. Given the wide range of estimates, we have taken the median value, £175,000, for the upfront costs incurred by providers. Based on 16 contract-based schemes having GARs, the estimated total cost is £2,800,000. This would occur only in the first year of the policy.</p>

            <p>There would also be an additional cost associated with ensuring that the risk warnings are sent a minimum of two weeks before the transfer of the pension goes ahead, to ensure that individuals have time to consider the implications of the information contained in the risk warning. This will require an additional requirement to be put into the transfer process to ensure transfers are paused until this two week period has elapsed. Since 100% of the contract based providers use the same not-for-profit transfer system called Origo, we consulted Origo to understand the impact of this change. Origo confirmed that this change would be low cost and completed as part of wider system updates. This cost has not been monetised.  </p>

            <p>For trust-based schemes, we assume the cheapest option to comply with the legislation would be to manually change existing documentation rather than amend bespoke computer systems since they do not have the scale of the contract-based schemes.  Therefore we assume no upfront system change costs but have larger on-going costs for each time a risk warning is produced. We assume a pension administrator would need to manually over-ride the system to insert appropriate standard text for a member’s policy from a database. The two comparable income projections would then be inserted based on fairly standard calculations. Trust-based schemes would need to ensure that the risk warning is produced and sent two weeks before the transfer goes ahead; since we assume that trust-based schemes will produce the risk warnings manually, we do not expect that a system change would be required, it would just form part of the manual process used by the scheme. In light of these requirements, we have assumed it would take three hours of a pension administrator’s time<authorialNote marker="49"><p> We did not receive any consultation responses providing further insight into the costs for trust-based schemes and, as these risk warnings are a new requirement specific to members with GARs, we do not have historic evidence on the costs of producing them. The on-going cost of £15 per individual risk warning for contract-based schemes represents approximately one hour of an administrator’s time.  In the consultation impact assessment we estimated a higher on-going time required for trust-based schemes than for contract based and this was not challenged.  Therefore we believe that, given the tasks listed above, three hours is a sensible assumption. Given the lack of evidence around the likely on-going costs for trust-based schemes with GARs, we have conducted sensitivity analysis around this assumption (see Risks and Assumptions section). This shows that the overall costs and benefits are not very sensitive to this assumption.</p></authorialNote>, costing £57.15. Based on the assumption that 4,117 members with trust-based schemes who have GARs will require risk warnings each year, this gives a cost of £235,287 per year.</p>

            <p>Pension providers will need to identify that someone falls within the sub-group by comparing the value of the member’s benefits taking into account of the GAR with the transfer value of those benefits, to check for cases where the former exceeds £30,000 but the latter does not. At that point in time, the provider will still be required to calculate the GAR and the transfer value is a known value - so this comparison should be relatively easy. We expect that providers will insert a standard paragraph into the existing communication informing individuals that they are required to seek advice, explaining that the rules around the advice requirement for those with safeguarded flexible benefits are changing and that if they wait until the date that the regulations come into force then they may no longer be required to seek advice.</p>

            <p>The transitional period will cover the six months preceding the date at which the policy comes into force. The number of members affected by these transitional arrangements is therefore estimated at six twelfths of the annual estimate of the number of GAR holders seeking to access the freedoms and who have a pot size of less than £30,000 but a value including the GAR of more than £30,000 (12,360 members). This gives an estimate of 6,180 members who will be affected by the transitional requirement.

This will contain projections of the income they would receive with and without their GAR.

            <p>Table 5 summarises out the costs and benefits to businesses that arise from the simplified advice requirement and the introduction of risk warnings. It assumes that the regulations come into force in April 2018 (and the transitional arrangements begin in October 2017). From October 2018, we assume annual costs of £1.15m and annual benefits of £3.33m. In year 1 (from October 2017 onwards) we assume that, prior to the regulations coming into force in April 2018, providers will incur familiarisation costs, the upfront costs of implementing the new risk warnings and transitional costs. Between April 2018 and September 2018 (inclusive) after the regulations have come into force, there will then be a six month equivalent of the annual on-going costs and benefits to providers.</p>

            <p>Table 5 shows that in year 1 (October 2017 to September 2018),  this policy will have a net cost to business, largely due to the upfront costs for contract-based providers to make the necessary system changes enabling them to provide the risk warnings. However, in subsequent years, the policy is expected to have a net benefit to businesses, arising from the simplified advice requirements. Over a period of ten years, the policy would have a net benefit to business of £17.81m. </p>

            <p>Table 6 summarises the impact on members. From year 2 onwards, members would save £11.12m per year; these savings occur as a result of fewer members being required to pay for financial advice. We have assumed that the regulations come into force in April 2018, meaning six months of savings to members would occur in year 1 (in the six months from April 2018). </p>

            <p>In the absence of any quantitative evidence on the breakdown of money purchase and non-money purchase GARs, there is a great deal of uncertainty around the estimate of the proportion of members and schemes with trust-based GARs that are non-money purchase (and thus in scope for these regulations). Our central estimate is 50%; if this is an under-estimate of the proportion that are non-money purchase, we will be under-estimating the number of GARs in scope for this policy. A lower number of trust-based schemes and individuals in scope would mean a lower benefit for providers (as a result of the simplified advice requirement), but this will be off-set by even lower costs as a result of fewer schemes facing familiarisation costs (in year 1 only) and schemes having to produce fewer risk warnings. Therefore a lower percentage of GARs being non-money purchase would mean we are currently over-estimating the cost to business. With no data to guide our assumption, we have tested a wide range around the central assumption; as an optimistic assumption we have assumed that 10% of GARs are non-money purchase; our pessimistic assumption is that 90% are non-money purchase. </p>

            <p>Sensitivity analysis around these assumptions shows that the overall costs and benefits to business are not very sensitive to this assumption. Increasing the proportion of schemes that are non-money purchase to 90% only increases the net costs to business by £0.02m in year 1 and £0.01m in subsequent years. Reducing the proportion to 10% on reduces the net costs by £0.01m in each year. Therefore, although there is no evidence to support the assumption that 50% of trust-based schemes and members with GARs are non-money purchase, the assumption does not represent a significant risk to our estimate of the net cost of this policy. </p>

            <p>We have assumed that 62.5% of those with GARs who ask about transferring or accessing their pension benefits flexibly proceed with that action. We have used this percentage to translate the estimated number of people who actually give up a GAR per year to the number of people enquiring (which is the total number that will require risk warnings). Our assumption is based on responses from two providers about the proportion of those with a GAR who enquire about flexibly accessing those benefits and then that go on to give up their GAR. One provider gave an estimate of 35% and another indicated a majority of theirs which we have interpreted as 90%; this gives an average of 62.5%.  If the true proportion of individuals who go on to access their GAR after enquiring is actually higher than 62.5%, it means that we will currently be over-estimating the total number who enquire – and as a result over-estimating the costs to business from producing the risk warnings and over-estimating the benefits to businesses from the simplified advice requirement. Overall we would currently be over-estimating the net cost to business. </p>

            <p>To test how sensitive the estimated business impacts are to this assumption, we have assumed a pessimistic assumption of 90% and a most optimistic assumption of 35% (assuming our two responses are the upper and lower bounds). The results show that, if 90% of those members who enquire about accessing their GAR go on to give it up, the net costs to business will be 0.33m higher than we have estimated in year 1 and 0.66m higher in subsequent years. On the other hand if only 35% go on to give up their GAR; the net costs to business will be 0.83m lower in year 1 and 1.71m lower in subsequent years.</p>

            <p>This suggests that the cost benefit analysis is reasonably sensitive to this assumption. Although there is uncertainty due to the low number of providers that responded to our request for information and the wide range in responses given by the providers that did give an estimate, we have sought to further test our assumption. The FCA<authorialNote marker="52"><p> FCA, Data Bulletin Issue 7, <a href="https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/data/data-bulletin-issue-7"><u>https://www.fca.org.uk/publications/data/data-bulletin-issue-7</u></a> </p></authorialNote> publishes statistics showing the proportion of those giving up their GAR out of the proportion taking some action with their pot (either giving up their GAR or taking up their GAR). Of those accessing their pension, 63% in Q4 2015 and 61% in Q1 2016 gave up their GAR. These statistics are not directly comparable as they will not capture those who enquired about accessing their GAR but then took no action (i.e. did not give up their GAR or take up their GAR) but would require a risk warning. Similarly, they would include any individuals who chose to take up their GAR without asking about other flexible options and so would not require a risk warning. Therefore the FCA statistics cannot be used as a direct substitute for the proportion of members who enquire about giving up their GAR and then subsequently give it up - but they do provide some support for our central assumption that 62.5% would give up their GAR after initially enquiring.  </p>

            <p>The policy applies to all safeguarded-flexible benefits but we only have data showing the incidence of GAR benefits, a particular type of safeguarded-flexible benefit (where members have a guaranteed rate at which they can convert their fund into a pension income at retirement). From consultation with industry throughout the policy development process, we understand that GARs are, by far, the most common type of safeguarded-flexible benefits in scope of this policy. Furthermore, in the impact assessment accompanying the consultation in September 2016, we assumed that the number of GARs could be used as a proxy for the number of safeguarded-flexible benefits and there were no concerns raised by stakeholders about this assumption. Therefore our central estimate is that the estimated number of GARs is a reasonable proxy for safeguarded-flexible benefits as a whole. However, if other types of safeguarded-flexible benefit do exist in non-negligible numbers, we may be under-estimating the number of firms and individuals affected by this policy.</p>

            <p>As part of our sensitivity analysis, we have increased the estimated number of individuals and firms affected by the policy, to account for an unknown quantity of safeguarded-flexible benefits which are not GARs. While we believe that the number of additional safeguarded-flexible benefits will be very low for the reasons explained above, we do not have any data on the number of safeguarded-flexible benefits which are not GARs to guide our assumptions. It would be very difficult to gather robust evidence about the volumes of safeguarded-flexible benefits which are not GAR benefits. We understand from stakeholder forums that they are likely to be concentrated in particular types of scheme such as small schemes or older schemes. These account for a relatively small proportion of pension scheme members and have, historically, tended to be less engaged with the Department, recording lower response rates to surveys.  We would therefore need to communicate with a very large number of schemes to robustly estimate the frequency of such benefits, which would be time-consuming and costly. Moreover, schemes may not be able to access this information easily. The information that we require will be held in individual contracts and in a lot of older and smaller schemes this information may not be digitally available. Safeguarded-flexible benefits that are not GARs can potentially vary substantially in design which means trustees and scheme managers may have to seek legal advice on a case-by-case basis to establish if the benefits they provide to members qualify as safeguarded and flexible. Therefore obtaining this information may be burdensome for schemes. </p>

            <p>As an upper estimate of the additional number of safeguarded-flexible benefits, we have tested the impact of assuming that only 80% of safeguarded-flexible benefits are GARs - therefore increasing our volumes by a factor of 1.25. The results show that this would mean higher costs for providers in producing and sending risk warnings, but also higher benefits as a result of the changes to the existing advice requirement. Overall the net costs to business would increase by £0.44m in the first year but fall by £0.55m in subsequent years. </p>

            <p>This suggests that, even if there are an additional 25% of individuals and providers affected by the policy – and we think this is unlikely given that the insights provided during the consultation process suggested that GARs represent the vast majority of safeguarded-flexible benefits – the net costs to business would only fall by around half a million pounds per year in steady state. For this level of sensitivity it would be disproportionate to undertake further work to estimate of the precise number of safeguarded-flexible benefits which are not GARs, given the cost that this would represent for government and industry.</p>

            <p>As our central estimate we have assumed that the cost that schemes currently incur to carry out the complicated calculation to assess the value of a member’s GAR is £187.50. This is based on the average of estimates given by two providers in response to a request for information by DWP; one gave an estimate of £250 to £400 (average=£325) and the other gave an estimate of £50.  Given the range in their responses, there is uncertainty around the cost that the current method of calculation represents to providers. If we over-estimate the current cost, it means we will over-estimate the benefits to providers arising from the simplification of the advice requirement rules. </p>

          <intro>
            <p>In order to test the impact on the net costs to business if we over- or under-estimate the current calculation costs per case, we have conducted sensitivity analysis around this assumption, using £325 as the most optimistic assumption and £50 as the most cautious. Sensitivity analysis shows that if the current calculation method only costs schemes and providers £50 per case, the net costs to business will be £1.14m higher in year 1 and £2.26m higher in subsequent years. If, on the other hand, the true cost were as high as £325, the net costs to business would be £1.13m lower in year 1 and £2.27m lower in subsequent years<authorialNote marker="53"><p> The asymmetry between £2.26m higher and £2.27m lower is due to rounding in the final costing tables. </p></authorialNote>. This shows that the analysis is quite sensitive to this assumption. However, we are believe that £50 would be a very cautious estimate; firstly it is significantly lower than the estimate provided by the other provider, but secondly  because, during the consultation process to determine whether the calculation method should be altered, schemes reported that applying the specified calculation method gave rise to ‘significant practical and financial burdens’<authorialNote marker="54"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/555564/consultation-valuing-pensions-for-the-advice-requirement-and-introducing-new-consumer-protections.pdf"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/555564/consultation-valuing-pensions-for-the-advice-requirement-and-introducing-new-consumer-protections.pdf</u></a> </p></authorialNote>.

Four providers gave numerical estimates of the set up costs that they expected to incur to meet these requirements. These estimates ranged from £50,000-£65,000 to £450,000.</p>

            <p>Sensitivity analysis of these assumptions shows that the estimated net costs to business in year 1 are very sensitive to this assumption; adopting £57,500 as a most optimistic assumption and £450,000 as the most pessimistic leads to net costs that are £1.88m lower and £4.40m higher respectively.

            <p>Given the risk around our estimated business impact as a result of this uncertainty, we sought to further test the assumption with other providers and industry stakeholders. This suggested that costs would be dependent on the complexity of the systems used by providers and so will vary – but that £450,000 is likely to be an outlier and does not reflect the costs that most providers would incur. This provided us with additional reassurance that taking the median estimate, £175,000, is appropriate. </p>

Estimates ranged from £0 to £60-£100. Adopting an optimistic assumption that providers would incur no on-going costs would mean that net costs were £0.42m lower in year 1 and £0.86m lower in subsequent years. Alternatively using the most pessimistic assumption of £80 per risk warning would add £1.86m to the net cost in year 1 and £3.70m per year in subsequent years.</p>

            <p>This suggests that the overall costs are sensitive to this assumption. However, the pessimistic scenario is based on an estimate from the provider who gave the lowest estimate of the upfront costs, perhaps suggesting that such high on-going costs would only occur where less comprehensive system changes were implemented. Given that we have assumed upfront costs of £175,000, it seems reasonable to assume that only limited on-going additional work would be required.  </p>

            <p>Furthermore, during the consultation process, providers did not raise concerns about the on-going financial burden that the new risk warnings would represent.

In their formal consultation responses, the majority of providers did not provide any alternative estimate of the on-going costs or make any comments suggesting that our estimates were too low. Similarly, during stakeholder roundtable events held as part of the consultation process, we sought views on the likely impacts of these measures and explicitly asked for feedback on our estimated costs. The events did not raise concerns that the risk warnings would lead to high on-going costs for providers. </p>

            <p>In the absence of any robust evidence about the on-going costs that would be incurred by trust-based schemes, we have made an estimate according to the processes that we expect that schemes would be required to carry out in order to comply with the regulations. Based on the activities described in the ‘Monetised and non-monetised costs and benefits’ section of this Impact Assessment, we have estimated that trust-based schemes would spend three hours per risk warning, at a cost of £57.15. </p>

            <p>We did not receive any consultation responses providing further insight into the costs for trust-based schemes and these risk warnings are a new requirement specific to members with GARs so we do not have historic evidence on the costs of producing them. Given the uncertainty, we have conducted sensitivity analysis around this assumption and have tested an optimistic assumption of on one hour of work being required (with a corresponding cost of £19.05) and a pessimistic assumption of 5 hours work (with a corresponding cost of £95.25). The results show that using the optimistic assumption would only make net costs £0.07m lower in year 1 and £0.16 lower in subsequent years, while the pessimistic assumption would only make net costs £0.08m higher in year 1 and £0.15 higher in subsequent years. Therefore, although we do not have robust evidence to guide our assumption, it represents a low risk as it does not make a big difference to the overall net costs.</p>

            <p>Table 7 shows that the assumptions which have the largest impact on the estimated net costs to business are those relating to the upfront and on-going costs for contract-based schemes in producing risk warnings, particularly the latter as this would have an on-going effect over a ten year period. However, having sought inputs from providers through formal consultation, as well as making direct requests for further evidence to consolidate our assumptions, we are confident that we have made the best possible estimate of the costs that these regulations will impose on contract-based providers.</p>

            <p>The proposal imposes a burden on businesses and is within the scope for one-in, three-out and the Business Impact Target (BIT). For the purposes of the BIT, net costs to business are to be presented in 2014 prices and discounted to 2015, in order for all policies to be compared using consistent pricing and discounting. Using a one year appraisal period from October 2017 and 3.5 per cent discount rate in line with the Treasury’s Green Book, we estimate that as a result of the increase in these direct costs to providers there is an Equivalent Annual Net Direct Cost to Business (EANDCB) worth -£1.6 million<b> </b>(2014/15 prices).</p>

            <p>We do not expect that these regulations will have a disproportionate impact on small and micro businesses. Only a minority of small and micro pension schemes are expected to have non-money purchase GARs, and for many of these the work of familiarisation and implementing changes will typically be carried out by an administrator or another other service provider. Those small and micro schemes that do carry out the familiarisation and implementation costs in-house will typically have very few members who actively seek to give up a GAR. The numbers will be even smaller on a per year basis. We therefore assume small and micro pension schemes will be able to meet these requirements manually, and we estimate that the costs of complying with these regulations will be low. Small and micro businesses affected would also benefit from the simplification of the advice requirement. </p>

            <p>The policy intent for tailored risk warnings is to ensure that all individuals with GARs are well-informed about their value before they make the decision to transfer or convert their pension pot and give up their GAR. Exempting any subset of pension providers from this requirement would risk some consumers not being informed of the value of their guarantee before giving it up. Granting small and micro businesses that offer safeguarded-flexible benefits a full exemption from the proposed cap would not be compatible with the aims of the policy. </p>

            <p>The consultation did not provide any evidence that this policy would have a disproportionate impact on small and micro-businesses.</p>

            <p>The preferred option is Option 2 - to simplify advice requirements for safeguarded pensions benefits so that the £30,000 threshold for seeking advice is based on the transfer value of the benefits (as opposed to the amount required to provide for the member’s accrued benefits), and introduce a requirement for firms to provide tailored risk warnings.</p>
