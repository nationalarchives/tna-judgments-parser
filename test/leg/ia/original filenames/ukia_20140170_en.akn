              <p>Impact assessments provide a valuable way of assessing different options for regulation and showing why the preferred option was chosen. They form part of best practice policy-making and are commonly used by other regulators. This is reflected in section 7 of the 2003 Act, which means that we will generally carry out impact assessments where proposals would be likely to have a significant effect on businesses or the general public, or when there is a major change in our activities.</p>

              <p>The impact of our policy decisions that have been implemented by the Regulations has already been assessed in the other documents referred to in this impact assessment. Accordingly, a separate impact assessment for the Regulations may not strictly be necessary. We nevertheless publish this document, which summarises the fuller assessments, as a matter of good practice.</p>

            <intro>
              <p>In the UK, Ofcom is responsible for authorising civil use of the radio spectrum and achieve this by granting wireless telegraphy licences under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 2006 (the ‘WT Act’) and by making regulations exempting users of particular equipment from the requirement to hold such a licence. Under section 8(1) of the WT Act, it is an offence to install or use wireless telegraphy equipment without holding a licence granted by us, unless the use of such equipment is exempted. Under section 8(4) of the WT Act, we are required to make regulations to exempt the use of wireless telegraphy equipment if the conditions in section 8(5) of the WT Act are met, namely, if its installation or use is not likely to:</p>

              <p>Our principal duty under section 3 of the 2003 Act is to further the interests of citizens in relation to communications matters; and of consumers in relevant markets, where appropriate by promoting competition. We take account of the impact of our decisions upon both citizen and consumer interests in the markets we regulate. We must, in particular, secure the optimal use for wireless telegraphy of spectrum and have regard to the principle under which all regulatory activities should be targeted only at cases in which action is needed. In deciding to make the changes to the existing regulations we have considered the wider impact beyond immediate stakeholders in the radiocommunications community. We believe that our decision will be of benefit to consumers for the following reasons:</p>

              <p>Following an initial assessment of our policy decisions we considered that it was reasonable to assume that any impacts on consumers and citizens arising from the Regulations in most cases would not differ significantly between groups or classes of UK consumers and citizens, all of whom would have access to these services, potentially at end-user prices reflective of all general input costs, including opportunity costs of spectrum used. We have not identified any particular impact in relation to the identified equality groups and we do not envisage that the Regulations are likely to be to the detriment of any group in society. Nor have we seen the need to carry out separate EIAs in relation to the additional equality groups in Northern Ireland: political opinion and dependants. This is because we anticipate that our decision will not have a differential impact in Northern Ireland compared to consumers in general.</p>

              <p>However, the SRD family of technologies that could be implemented in the 915 to 921 MHz band includes Assistive Listening Devices (ALDs), which are used by citizens who are hard of hearing or partially deaf. ALDs enable citizens who are hard of hearing or partially deaf to hear speech and music. ALDs work by taking the speech or music, amplifying it by placing a microphone near the sound source and using wireless to transmit the sound to the listener. ALDs are used by both groups and individuals. Devices aimed at group use broadcast the sound to more than one person; examples include induction loop, infrared and frequency modulation (FM) systems. Devices designed for personal use are generally configured to work with a single speaker; examples include wireless personal FM systems and wireless headphones. </p>

              <p>Our decision to licence-exempt these devices in the 870 to 876 MHz and 915 to 921 MHz frequency bands is likely to bring increased access to ALD services and increase the choice of technologies and devices available to the hard of hearing or partially deaf because we are adding a further 2 x 6 MHz of spectrum to supplement what has already been made available for licence-exempt services. We do not consider that there is evidence to suggest that costs for ALD users would differ significantly relative to consumers in general. However, the band will be available to all compliant SRDs and exempting SRDs from licensing means that there is no limit to the numbers of compliant devices that can be operated. </p>

              <p>We seek wherever possible, to reduce the regulatory burden upon our stakeholders, in this instance users of the radio spectrum. One way in which we can do this is to remove the need for spectrum users to apply for individual licences to authorise the use of radio equipment. Exemption is realised by describing the details of equipment and the parameters under which it may be used in a Statutory Instrument (secondary legislation called Regulations) that exempts users of such equipment from the need to hold a licence provided they comply with the terms of the regulations.</p>

              <p>When considering the authorisation of devices Ofcom can either licence them or make regulations to exempt them from licensing. Section 8(4) of the WT Act requires that if Ofcom is satisfied that the criteria set out in section 8(5) of the WT Act are met, Ofcom must make regulations to licence-exempt the equipment. If the equipment does not meet all of the requirements of section 8(5) this does not prevent us still going ahead with exemption but any decision would need to consider the impacts verses the benefits of any such decision.</p>

              <p>Generally, licence exemption presents the lowest barrier to entry compared with other forms of authorisation, such as individual licences. Our analysis takes this proposition as a starting point and then assesses concerns over harmful interference or congestion to existing users (if any) or potential new users of the band. Harmful interference or congestion could negate the benefits of any reductions in the regulatory burden gained from exemption.</p>

              <p>Most of the measures that the Regulations introduce could assist the development of a harmonised market across Europe for certain devices. This would bring with it many benefits from the free circulation and use of devices. Manufacturers benefit from economies of scale which drive down prices for consumers. Citizens are able to benefit from continued access to devices when travelling to other European countries. </p>

              <p>Based on the responses to our 870/915 Consultation, we consider that the potential value from spectrum used to deliver the Internet of Things (IoT) to the wider economy could be significant. The release of these bands will give UK businesses the chance to help lead the way in the new markets for smart energy, remote health monitoring and smart cities as the UK will be one of the first countries in Europe to make this spectrum available for Machine to Machine (M2M) uses. Releasing the 870 to 876 MHz and 915 to 921 MHz bands for use of those devices could also assist with realising some of the benefit highlighted the Government’s new spectrum strategy that aims to double the economic benefits of spectrum to £100 billion by 2025<authorialNote marker="9"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-at-cebit-uk-and-germany-can-lead-technological-revolution"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/news/pm-at-cebit-uk-and-germany-can-lead-technological-revolution</u></a> </p></authorialNote>.</p>

              <p>Additional benefits may be realised through the deployment of Low Power Active Medical Implants (LP-AMI). These enable medical patients to be monitored and treated via wireless sensors without requiring them to be wired to devices. In the long term this technology may enable patients to live longer in the community, rather than be hospitalised. This could provide significant savings relating to the provision of health services in the UK.</p>

              <p>There is more spectrum for wireless alarms that support the elderly and vulnerable in society and ALDs, which improve hearing ability for people in a variety of situations. It should increase the choice of technologies and devices available to the hard of hearing or partially deaf because we are adding a further 12 MHz of spectrum to these type of devices to supplement what has already been made available for licence-exempt services.</p>

              <p>Overall we believe that costs to business are likely to be lower under a licence-exempt approach than the requirement for users to obtain individual licences. Licence exemption represents the least cost regulatory approach to authorisations for the use of spectrum. For example if use of spectrum is authorised through a licence, businesses face administrative costs associated with applying for the licence and the cost of the licence itself.</p>

We consider that each measure is unlikely to impose costs on other users. Therefore the effect of implementing the measures is likely to be positive overall.</p>

              <p>There are one-off administrative costs associated with making Statutory Instruments. We consider the implementation costs to be low, both in absolute terms and in comparison to licensing alternatives that might require an auction or the maintenance of a licensing scheme. Moreover, the costs such as they should also be offset by the benefits to businesses and consumers outlined above. There may also be a slight reduction in spectrum management costs in certain areas through licence exemption.</p>
