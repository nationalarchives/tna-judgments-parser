                <p class="ia-table-text">Waste generation produces negative environmental externalities. It emits greenhouse gases when sent to treatment such as incineration or landfill. When waste cannot be prevented, recycling reduces the environmental costs of products/materials being disposed of. This is because recycling is a less carbon intensive process. It also generates value by providing raw materials for manufacturing. However, current measures for household collection of recyclable materials, such as landfill tax or dry recycling separation, are proving insufficient to increase recycling beyond the current level of 44%-45% and reduce the amount of residual waste produced, which is required for the Government to meet its statutory Environment Act 2021 target to halve residual waste per capita by the end of 2042<authorialNote marker="1"><p class="ia-table-text"> <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2022/9780348242973/body"><u>The Environmental Targets (Residual Waste) (England) Regulations 2022 (legislation.gov.uk)</u></a></p></authorialNote>. Loose requirements on local authority (LA) waste collections have led to a variety of different collection systems and materials collected, leading to different recycling performance and experience for householders across England. This limits potential recycling and the environmental and economic benefits that could be achieved. Furthermore, less separated waste streams are associated with lower quality recyclate.<authorialNote marker="2"><p class="ia-table-text"> See Section 6 on contamination.</p></authorialNote> For non-household municipal waste (NHM), businesses usually pay for waste collections on a per lift or bin basis. This means that introducing additional recycling may require additional bins and this may in return increase waste management costs, leading to relatively low recycling behaviour in businesses currently. Government intervention is required to enable a consistent range of recyclable waste materials to be collected from households and businesses to overcome these barriers in order to achieve higher recycling rates.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">The policy objective is to reduce the negative environmental impacts of waste by increasing both (i) the quantity of materials collected for recycling, and (ii) the quality of recyclate produced due to improved material segregation. The proposed changes will expand the range of materials collected and help citizens make the right decisions on what can be recycled at home, school and work, reducing contamination. Decreased contamination will boost reprocessors’ confidence in the quality of recyclate being collected, increasing demand for secondary materials. These changes will ensure that minimal waste goes to landfill, and more food waste and garden waste is composted or sent for anaerobic digestion. The policy will also help to achieve the ambition to reach 65% municipal recycling rate by 2035 and support the Government’s Environment Act target of halving residual waste by the end of 2042<authorialNote marker="3"><p class="ia-table-text"><b> </b><a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukdsi/2022/9780348242973/body"><b><u>The Environmental Targets (Residual Waste) (England) Regulations 2022 (legislation.gov.uk)</u></b></a></p></authorialNote> and the commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.   </p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">Within the constraints of existing legal requirements, local authorities can decide on a local basis what and how materials are collected from households for recycling. This has led to a large variety of service collection profiles and current legislative or fiscal drivers are unlikely to change this (i.e., they proved to be insufficient to increase current levels of recycling, which have plateaued at 44-45% since 2015<authorialNote marker="4"><p class="ia-table-text"> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/uk-waste-data/uk-statistics-on-waste"><u>UK statistics on waste - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</u></a></p></authorialNote>). Further non-regulatory options were considered, e.g., voluntary frameworks and guidance, educational/communication schemes, businesses support via specific grants and tools. They were disregarded on the basis that these options are already operating but have not achieved the intended policy objectives. Waste &amp; Resources Action Programme (“WRAP”, a climate action non-governmental organisation) and other organisations continue to work with local authorities and businesses to improve recycling. WRAP, for example, worked with the waste sector to develop a voluntary Consistency Framework, but this has not been taken up by the majority of local authorities because of other funding pressures and an absence of additional legal drivers. For businesses, a range of voluntary initiatives have operated but there have been no drivers for the sector to actively recycle waste and the costs of the change to businesses, without rationalisation of waste services, can inhibit the transition. In response to this, Government has concluded that we should implement measures to improve consistency in recycling for households and businesses.</p>

They include buying new vehicles, containers, and wider transition costs. Local authorities also have a cost of £0.2m for completing written assessments to apply for collection exemptions. £1,322m is a loss of income from removed garden waste charging. This is a transfer to households as they generate savings from removed garden waste charges. The remaining balance is changes in on-going costs (£1,667m) and DRS net effect (£474m saving). DRS net effect is the difference in DRS-specific costs between the baseline and a relevant policy option. We estimate the following transition costs to the NHM sector: £132m familiarisation costs. The NHM waste management costs decrease by £561m (including DRS net effect). The NHM sector also has a cost of £3.4m for written assessments. The policy support costs (including compliance and enforcement) are estimated to be £65m (of which £1.8m are transition costs). All values presented are discounted.<b> </b></p>

However, this is a transfer as it reduces revenue for the Government. The Government therefore has a lost benefit of £4,175m in reduced landfill tax receipts.

However, this aligns with our cautious approach to estimating costs to businesses. The baseline is also adjusted to include the DRS effect. For Option 1M, we assume that 80% of the total tonnage that could be recycled is presented by business. This is our central estimate. We also modelled 70% and 90% capture rates for low and high estimates, respectively. The high and low sensitivities also include familiarisation costs, lift prices and DRS effect.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">For the cross-cutting impacts (carbon savings), we used low, central and high carbon prices.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">Local authorities see their net waste management costs increase by £3,513m. Out of these costs, £998m are transition costs. They include buying new vehicles, containers and wider transition costs. Local authorities also have a cost of £0.2m for completing written assessments to apply for collection exemptions. £1,322m is a loss of income from removed garden waste charging. This is a transfer to households as they generate savings from removed garden waste charges. The remaining balance is changes in on-going costs (£1,667m) and DRS net effect (£474m saving). We estimate the following transition costs to the NHM sector: £354m familiarisation cost. The NHM waste management costs increase by £3,164m (including DRS net effect); this consists of a £3,594m cost increase to micro firms and a £430m saving to the remaining businesses. Although micro firms are phased into the policy from 31st March 2027, they are one of the most affected groups given their large number. The NHM sector also has a cost of £3.4m for written assessments. The policy support costs (including compliance and enforcement) are estimated to be £65m (of which £1.8m are transition costs).

                <p class="ia-table-text">Local authorities see their net waste management costs decrease by £188m. Out of these costs, £722m are transition costs. They include buying new vehicles, containers and wider transition costs. Local authorities also have a cost of £0.2m for completing written assessments to apply for collection exemptions. £1,003m is additional income from garden waste charging. This is a transfer from participating households that are charged for their garden waste to be collected. The remaining balance is changes in on-going costs (£567m) and DRS net effect (£474m saving). We estimate the following transition costs to the NHM sector: £132m familiarisation costs. The NHM waste management costs decrease by £562m (including DRS net effect).<b> </b>The NHM sector also has a cost of £3.4m for written assessments. The policy support costs (including compliance and enforcement) are estimated to be £65m (of which £1.8m are transition costs). All values presented are discounted.</p>

This is a disbenefit to them of £1,003m over the appraisal period. There is a benefit to local authorities (£150m) and NHM (£3,486m) from reduced landfill tax payments. However, this is a transfer as it reduces revenue for the Government. The Government therefore has a lost benefit of £4,175m in reduced landfill tax receipts. There is a saving to the NHM sector of £3,486m from reduced landfill tax payments (NB landfill tax payments concerning local authorities are included in their waste management costs). Carbon savings (traded and non-traded) are estimated at £7,269m. These savings are net of emissions associated with an increase in recycling activity. All values are discounted.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">For the household sector, the uptake in recycling is estimated based on WRAP’s modelling. The modelling reflects different collection schemes, rurality, deprivation levels and ONS data across different local authority areas. The high and low sensitivities do not assume any change in recycling yields from best estimates. They account for different material prices and gate fees and reflect uncertainty associated with key capital (such as vehicles and containers) and operating costs (such as labour). Concerning garden waste collections, we assume that the households (that are charged) have requested to have a separate collection.  </p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">The NHM ‘presented’ baseline recycling rate is estimated to be 43.3%. It is likely that this is an overestimate which means that we might overestimate costs to businesses and underestimate carbon savings. However, this aligns with our cautious approach to estimating costs to businesses. The baseline is also adjusted to include the DRS effect.<b> </b> For Option 3M, we assume that 80% of the total tonnage that could be further recycled is presented by business. This is our central estimate. We also modelled 70% and 90% capture rates for low and high estimates, respectively. The high and low sensitivities also include familiarisation costs, lift prices and DRS effect. </p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">For the cross-cutting impacts (carbon savings), we used low, central and high carbon prices.</p>

This is a transfer from participating households that are charged for their garden waste to be collected. The remaining balance is changes in on-going costs (£567m) and DRS net effect (£474m saving). We estimate the following transition costs to the NHM sector: £354m familiarisation costs. The NHM waste management costs (excluding landfill tax) increase by £3,164m relative to the baseline (including DRS net effect); this consists of a £3,594m cost increase to micro firms and a £430m saving to the remaining businesses. Although micro firms are phased into the policy from 31st March 2027, they are one of the most affected groups given their large number.<b> </b>The NHM sector also has a cost of £3.4m for written assessments.

The modelling reflects different collection schemes, rurality, deprivation levels and ONS data across different local authority areas. The high and low sensitivities do not assume any change in recycling yields from best estimates. They account for different material prices and gate fees and reflect uncertainty associated with key capital (such as vehicles and containers) and operating costs (such as labour). Concerning garden waste collections, we assume that the households (that are charged) have requested to have a separate collection.  </p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">The NHM ‘presented’ baseline recycling rate is estimated to be 43.3%. It is likely that this is an overestimate which means that we might overestimate costs to businesses and underestimate carbon savings. However, this aligns with our cautious approach to estimating costs to businesses. The baseline is also adjusted to include the DRS effect.<b> </b>For Option 4M, we assume that 80% of the total tonnage that could be recycled is presented by business. This is our central estimate. We also modelled 70% and 90% capture rates for low and high estimates, respectively. The high and low sensitivities also include familiarisation costs, lift prices and DRS effect. For the cross-cutting impacts (carbon savings), we used low, central and high carbon prices.</p>

          <p><b>Packaging Extended Producer Responsibility (pEPR): </b>the UK Government together with the Devolved Administrations are reforming the UK packaging producer responsibility system and introducing EPR for household packaging. This includes placing the net costs of managing household packaging waste onto producers, who are best placed to influence packaging design. This is consistent with the ‘polluter pays’ principle. This will help deliver commitments made by the UK Government and the Devolved Administrations in various policy documents to maximise value from resources and minimise waste through the circular use of materials and to better incentivise producers to manage resources more efficiently. The new regulations should increase the recyclability and reusability of packaging by rewarding/penalising producers according to specified criteria. Consumers will find it easier to recycle packaging due to clearer recyclability labelling from the pEPR scheme, aligning with the EU regulations<authorialNote marker="5"><p> <a href="https://environment.ec.europa.eu/publications/proposal-packaging-and-packaging-waste_en"><u>Proposal Packaging and Packaging Waste - European Commission (europa.eu)</u></a></p></authorialNote>.

The reason for the distinction is that it is usually easier to collect waste from low-rise properties and residents tend to use their own recycling bins more than in flatted properties. This is because the recycling facilities in the flatted properties are more complex, there may be inadequate space at the point of collection to separate recyclables, etc.</p>

          <p>This is a final impact assessment to assess the final policy proposals on Simpler Recycling in England (previously known as “Consistency in Recycling”). There were four consultations on this policy. We first consulted on the policy in February – May 2019<authorialNote marker="7"><p> <u>Consistency in recycling collections in England: executive summary and government response 2019</u></p></authorialNote>. Our second consultation was in May – July 2021<authorialNote marker="8"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consistency-in-household-and-business-recycling-in-england"><u>Consultation on consistency in household and business recycling in England government response 2021</u></a> </p></authorialNote>. We held two further consultations in October – November 2023: a targeted consultation on exemptions and statutory guidance<authorialNote marker="9"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/exemptions-and-statutory-guidance-for-simpler-recycling-in-england"><u>Exemptions and statutory guidance for simpler recycling in England government response 202</u></a>3</p></authorialNote>, and a public consultation on additional policies<authorialNote marker="10"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/simpler-recycling-in-england-additional-policies"><u>Simpler recycling in England: additional policies government response</u></a> 2023</p></authorialNote>. There were two accompanying impact assessments to assess the economic case of the proposed policy options, published in 2019 and 2021. This final impact assessment builds on the earlier assessments. It reflects the final policies, implemented through The Separation of Waste (England) Regulations 2024 and The Separation of Waste (England) (No. 2) Regulations 2024, and incorporates the latest evidence available. </p>

          <p>The final impact assessment covers municipal waste, which is comprised of household waste and businesses and public sector organisations that generate household-like waste. In this document non-household premises affected are referred to as municipal businesses or the non-household municipal sector (NHM). Despite being grouped together as the municipal sector, waste collections for households and municipal businesses are very different and will be addressed separately throughout the impact assessment. For example, the NHM sector is overall more complex than the household sector given its diversity and no organisation to manage waste collections between the businesses and the waste collectors (as a local authority does for households).</p>

          <p>In 2019, we consulted on proposals to require all local authorities in England to collect the same core set of dry recyclable materials from households and have separate weekly food waste collections from households, and other policies related to recycling. The intention of this proposal was to increase the overall quantity and quality of recycling collected in order to reduce the negative environmental impacts. Previous recycling requirements have proven insufficient to increase recycling beyond the current level of 44-45% for households (this rate has not changed for the past 5 years) and 43.3%<authorialNote marker="11"><p> Presentational recycling rates from WRAP analysis.</p></authorialNote> for businesses. Additionally, previous policy has led to a lack of consistency in waste collection services (including different materials collected for recycling) and recycling performance across England. </p>

          <p>Following support for the proposals in our 2019 consultation, the Environment Act 2021 amended the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (“the Act”) to require the following recyclable waste streams to be collected for recycling or composting from all households in England: glass, metal, plastic, paper and card, food waste and garden waste. Food waste must be collected at least weekly from households. The Act also requires businesses and relevant non-domestic premises (such as schools and hospitals) in England to make arrangements for the same recyclable waste streams, except garden waste, to be collected for recycling or composting. Together, waste collected from these premises is referred to in this impact assessment as ‘municipal waste’.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>The Act requires that the recyclable waste streams are collected separately from residual waste in all circumstances and collected separately from each other unless certain exceptions apply (if it is not technically or economically practicable to collect separately or it does not offer the best environmental outcomes). In these circumstances, LAs and other waste collectors may co-collect recyclable waste streams on production of a written assessment to justify use of an exception. In all circumstances, the dry recyclable waste streams (plastic, metal, glass and paper and card) must still be collected separately from food and garden waste.</p>

      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Additionally, the Secretary of State has the power to set exemptions in regulations from the requirement to separately collect the recyclable waste streams, if satisfied that doing so will not significantly reduce the potential for recyclable waste streams to be recycled or composted. The Secretary of State intends to provide exemptions to allow for the co-collection of metal, plastic and glass and the co-collection of food and garden waste, in all circumstances without the need to produce a written assessment. Paper and card should be collected separately from the other recyclable waste streams by default, unless a short written assessment is produced by local authorities and other waste collectors to demonstrate that it is not technically or economically practical, or there is no significant environmental benefit in doing so. Therefore, waste collectors will choose how to collect recycling. Please note the recyclable waste streams must still be collected separately from residual waste in all circumstances, and dry recycling must still be collected separately from food/garden waste. If a waste collector intends to co-collect food and garden waste from households at a frequency of less than weekly (fortnightly, for example), then a separate food waste collection must be provided on the weeks when the co-collection of food and garden waste does not take place in order to satisfy the requirement that food waste is collected weekly from households.</p>

          <p>Overall, introducing consistent municipal collection requirements can unlock significant environmental and financial benefits and increase the quantity and quality of materials collected for recycling and reprocessing into secondary raw materials. There are currently, significant barriers limiting further uptake such as insufficient pricing of environmental externalities, behavioural barriers at the point of materials’ collection or fragile secondary materials markets<authorialNote marker="14"><p> There are a number of proposals – set out in our Resource and Waste Strategy - to help stimulate supply and demand for secondary materials. This is because it is often cheaper to use virgin raw materials than recycled, despite their higher environmental impact. </p></authorialNote> preventing these benefits being realised. Through mandating increased standardisation of materials collected for recycling across England, we expect to improve waste collection services and performance (i.e., this is because the current approach to recycling is fragmented and inconsistent across England). We also expect communications and clearer labelling to improve business and residential understanding of what can be recycled, leading to high recycling rates by both sectors as well as lower contamination<authorialNote marker="15"><p> Recycling contamination occurs when materials are sorted into the wrong recycling bin, or when materials are not properly cleaned (such as food residue remains on a plastic container). Such contamination can reduce the quality and value of recyclate and can lead to rejection at reprocessing or sorting centres.</p></authorialNote> and greater compliance with the requirements. </p>

          <p>Table 1 informs our options appraisal and summarises our high-level theory of change for Simpler Recycling. Throughout our appraisal, we refer to local authorities when representing Waste Collection Authorities (WCAs) and/or Waste Disposal Authorities (WDAs), unless otherwise stated. This is because the proposed policy affects both waste collection as well as waste treatment and/or disposal. Similarly, affected businesses and non-domestic premises are referred to as ‘municipal businesses’ or the ‘NHM sector’. </p>

          <p>For the household sector, we have modelled two options (i.e., Option 1hh and 2hh) based on the preferred option from the second consultation impact assessment. <b>Option 1hh</b> assumes consistent weekly collection of dry recyclable waste streams (paper and card, plastic, metal and glass) through systems with further separation. It assumes fortnightly residual collections, separate weekly food waste and free fortnightly garden waste collections. It also assumes high-rise properties transition at the same time as low-rise properties. All high-rise properties have separate food waste collections. <b>Option 2hh</b> is the same as 1hh option except it is assumed that all local authorities have charged garden waste collections for low rise properties with gardens. A charged garden waste scenario had been disregarded in our consultation impact assessment due to a relatively low net present value (NPV) compared to options which had free garden waste associated with them. The higher NPV associated with the free garden waste scenario was largely driven by the increased carbon emissions savings from the assumed higher participation in garden waste schemes. However, we have gathered some new evidence and reviewed our modelling around garden waste<authorialNote marker="18"><p> Improved assumptions on garden waste tonnages disposed of in residual waste streams in free collection and charged collection scenarios.</p></authorialNote>.

          <p>For modelling purposes, we have assumed that all businesses will separate waste to mixed dry recyclables and have separate glass and food waste collections under the proposed policy option. We use this option as the most likely scenario on the assumption that the majority of businesses are likely to seek to reduce the space required for waste receptacles, using the exemption and exceptions as necessary. This is based on the national surveys of waste collections from businesses and waste collector offerings<authorialNote marker="20"><p> Source: WRAP.</p></authorialNote>. They show that the majority of recyclable waste collections provided to the NHM sector are currently for mixed dry recyclables. This is because most sites have limited space; and, also, not every business generates all the material streams in scope of reforms. As such, we have modelled partially mixed dry collections (with glass as a separate stream). Please see Section 6 for more information.</p>

          <p>The NPV (2024-2035) of these two options combined (i.e., Option 4M) is £5,915.2m. Although this combination of options does not yield the highest NPV (i.e., net benefit to society), there was strong support from consultation responses for micro firms to be included in the new requirements<authorialNote marker="23"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consistency-in-household-and-business-recycling-in-england/outcome/government-response"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consistency-in-household-and-business-recycling-in-england/outcome/government-response</u></a> </p></authorialNote>. Including micro firms will help increase our recycling rate. Our estimate is that this option could achieve between 9.9 to 17.3 percentage point increase in municipal recycling rate by 2035. Our central estimate is a 13.6 percentage point increase, meaning an increase in recycling rate from 42.3% to 55.9% by 2035.</p>

          <p>As part of this impact assessment, we have considered two mitigation options for micro firms that exempt micro firms or allow them additional implementation time to make required changes. Given that the inclusion of micro firms increases our NHM recycling rates by 9.3 percentage points as well as increases our carbon savings by £3.1-3.2bn<authorialNote marker="24"><p> The additional carbon savings of including micro firms are dependent on the HH option. There are discounted carbon savings of £3.149bn under Option 1hh and £3.197bn Option 2hh.</p></authorialNote>, our preferred option is 2nhm. Since micro firms produce nearly 30% of the total non-household municipal waste, including them in the new requirements, also helps divert increased amounts of biodegradable materials (e.g., food waste, paper and cardboard) away from landfill. This is in line with our overall Net Zero strategy commitment to explore policies to work towards the near elimination of biodegradable municipal waste to landfill by 2028.</p>

To reflect uncertainty around this estimate, we also present a low and high estimate for each option in addition to a central estimate. The central estimate(s) is lower compared to the previous consultation impact assessment.

Some have also introduced charges for previously-free services such as garden waste collection. Local authorities’ budget provisions have reduced and, together with the slowing impact of current incentives<authorialNote marker="30"><p> E.g., landfill tax. </p></authorialNote>, this has led to a lack of investment in new recycling services. Landfill tax has been one of the drivers for local authorities to divert household waste from landfill and towards energy recovery or recycling<authorialNote marker="31"><p> <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmenvfru/241/24105.htm"><u>https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201415/cmselect/cmenvfru/241/24105.htm</u></a></p></authorialNote>. The Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011 also require waste collectors to separately collect wastepaper, metal, plastic and glass unless one of a list of conditions is met (set out on page 24 below). Together with the improvements in recycling and energy recovery plants, local authorities have seen a 72% reduction by weight of collected waste sent to landfill since 2010/11<authorialNote marker="32"><p> Our Waste, Our Resources: A Strategy for England, 2018: <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/765914/resources-waste-strategy-dec-2018.pdf"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/765914/resources-waste-strategy-dec-2018.pdf</u></a><u> </u></p></authorialNote>. This has incentivised local authorities to provide recycling services for most dry materials. However, these regulatory drivers are not sufficient for expanding certain collections (for example, providing separate food waste collections) and the benefits of expanding recycling services to include certain types of plastics are limited because the value of those materials on secondary markets does not outweigh the costs of collection. </p>

          <p>Government supports comprehensive and frequent waste collections. Currently, there is limited consistency around materials that local authorities collect for recycling. Not all local authorities in England collect glass and plastic pots, tubs and trays (PTT), for example, at 86% and 83% respectively<authorialNote marker="33"><p> Based on 2020/21 data using WRAP’s Toolbox based on local authorities’ portal self-reported inputs.</p></authorialNote>. Concerning plastic film, only 17% of local authorities collect it for recycling<authorialNote marker="34"><p> Based on 2020/21 data using WRAP’s Toolbox based on local authorities’ portal self-reported inputs.</p></authorialNote>.  Greater consistency, for example, means that local authorities that do not already collect plastic film will be required to collect it for recycling. Requiring all local authorities to collect the same materials from kerbside will help increase the quantity and quality of materials collected for recycling. It could also help reduce consumer confusion (by ensuring that the same materials are collected for recycling across England, e.g., 40% of the public think recycling rules should be simplified<authorialNote marker="35"><p> <a href="https://www.confused.com/recycling-confusion"><u>https://www.confused.com/recycling-confusion</u></a> </p></authorialNote>).  </p>

As a result, householders either recycle fewer items than they are able to or contaminate recycling with items that are not collected locally for recycling or are non-recyclable. Such contamination can reduce the quality and value of recyclate and can lead to rejection at reprocessing or sorting centres. This in turn reduces our overall recycling rate and reduces the amount of material made available to producers to be recycled into new products, or for packaging producers to achieve targets and obligations to recycle a set proportion of the packaging they place on the UK market. Also, any recycling materials destined for other countries must meet strict criteria in accordance with waste import and export legislation<authorialNote marker="37"><p> <a href="https://governmentbusiness.co.uk/news/22102018/china-recycling-restrictions-hitting-uk-councils"><u>https://governmentbusiness.co.uk/news/22102018/china-recycling-restrictions-hitting-uk-councils</u></a></p></authorialNote>,<authorialNote marker="38"><p> <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/resources/report/gate-fees-reports"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/resources/report/gate-fees-reports</u></a></p></authorialNote>.

          <p>High profile media coverage of waste, such as in the programme “Blue Planet,” mean that there is increased public demand to tackle the problem of waste in more effective ways and to recycle more materials, especially plastics. Similarly, the latest YouGov survey results show that the British public want more to be done to encourage recycling in the UK<authorialNote marker="39"><p> <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/topics/science/articles-reports/2019/11/04/britons-say-more-needs-be-done-encourage-recycling"><u>https://yougov.co.uk/topics/science/articles-reports/2019/11/04/britons-say-more-needs-be-done-encourage-recycling</u></a></p></authorialNote>.

This has an estimated sale value of over £19 billion a year and is associated with more than 25 million tonnes of GHG emissions<authorialNote marker="43"><p> Based on lifecycle emissions (e.g., including production, packaging, transport, waste management).

The detrimental impacts of food waste on the environment are significant. Food waste that is sent to landfill generates methane (i.e., a powerful greenhouse gas 25 times more powerful than CO2<authorialNote marker="44"><p> Over 100 years, IPCC AR5 Synthesis Report.</p></authorialNote>).</p>

Separate collection of food waste for treatment by anaerobic digestion has higher environmental outcomes than co-mingling food and garden waste by in vessel composting (IVC)<authorialNote marker="47"><p> Based off WRAP analysis, we have modelled that the traded carbon savings from collecting food waste separately and having it treated via AD (-0.0867T CO2e/T) are greater than the non-traded carbon savings of having food waste collected in a comingled collection and treated at an IVC facility (-0.0393T CO2e/T).</p></authorialNote>. Both anaerobic digestion and IVC recycle food waste by turning it into a form of organic fertiliser, but only anaerobic digestion reclaims energy through the production of biogas. If all local authorities provided at least kerbside properties with a household food waste collection this would increase the amount of food waste collected per year by an estimated 1.33 million tonnes by 2035. </p>

          <p>Providing all kerbside properties (that have gardens) with a free garden waste collection could help increase recycling rates and could also ensure this material is sent to industrial composting rather than sometimes discarded in residual waste bins. Charging for garden waste is likely to reduce the number of households using the service, therefore, it potentially increases levels of garden waste in residual waste. Where this is sent to landfill, this generates greenhouse gas emissions as well as leachate, an acidic liquid which needs to be extracted and treated. </p>

          <p>However, without the amendments to the Environmental Protection Act 1990, there is no requirement on the non-household municipal sector to arrange for their waste to be recycled. Given that waste collection services are offered on a per bin or per lift basis, businesses would pay a higher cost for having additional bins for recycling, unless they produced enough waste to be able to reduce their number of residual waste bins. This is because a typical residual waste collection service usually costs more than recyclable waste collection service.</p>

          <p>Current measures and requirements for household collection of recyclable materials, such as landfill tax or the current legislative requirements, are proving insufficient to increase household recycling beyond the current level of 44%-45% and reduce the amount of residual waste produced. Flexible requirements on local authority waste collections have led to a variety of different collection systems and materials collected, leading to different performance across the country as evidenced in the recent DEFRA statistics release on local authority collected waste management<authorialNote marker="57"><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122#:~:text=In%202021%2F22%2C%20total%20local,cent)%20from%202020%2F21.</u></a></p></authorialNote>, as well as in WasteDataFlow (WDF)<authorialNote marker="58"><p> <a href="https://www.wastedataflow.org/"><u>https://www.wastedataflow.org/</u></a></p></authorialNote> and WRAP’s LA Portal<authorialNote marker="59"><p> <a href="https://laportal.wrap.org.uk/"><u>https://laportal.wrap.org.uk/</u></a> </p></authorialNote>.

          <p>The NHM sector also has low levels of recycling (i.e., our current estimate is 36.5%<authorialNote marker="60"><p> Based on WRAP’s analysis. WRAP estimated the presented business recycling rate of 43.3%. We adjusted this estimate to reflect that there are some process losses (when materials go through MRFs), based on discussions with the industry. </p></authorialNote>). Businesses usually pay for waste collections on a per-lift or per-bin basis. Recycling collection charges per ‘bin-empty’ are lower than for residual bins due to the higher value of the material and their lower disposal costs compared to refuse. However, diverting some recyclable waste from the refuse bin still, almost certainly, means that a refuse container is required despite it becoming less full. The need for a range of recyclable containers to collect the extra material streams will increase cost to businesses unless all of the waste from the refuse bin can be removed and that service suspended or reduced in frequency e.g., three-weekly collections instead of two-weekly. Consequently, introducing additional recycling bins may not lead to reduced waste costs.</p>

          <p>Overall, the case for change in the municipal sector is undermined if the overall business case from higher recycling is poor from a private perspective. This is due to high upfront costs and uncertain future savings (because they depend on assumptions of higher recycling rates (e.g., economies of scale) and secondary material prices (which depend on the quality of recyclates)). In addition, waste and recycling services have not typically been a priority area for businesses or local authorities in recent years.

          <p>The Environmental Protection Act 1990 (until the amendments in the Environment Act 2021 have been commenced) requires WCAs to make arrangements for the collection of at least two types of recyclable waste together or individually separated from the rest of the household waste. There are also further requirements on local authorities set out in the Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011. The current legislation means that WCAs do not all collect the same range of materials and there are circumstances under which local authorities do not have to collect the recyclable waste streams separately from residual waste. Whilst this helps to account for local circumstances, this creates a fragmented and inconsistent approach to recycling across England. As a result, householders are having very different experiences of recycling depending on where they live. There is also some uncertainty about what can and cannot be recycled (this was identified as one of the most frequently cited barriers). Evidence shows that this can create confusion to householders over the type of materials collected and the way they should be presented for the collection<authorialNote marker="63"><p> <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45496884"><u>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-45496884</u></a> </p></authorialNote>,<authorialNote marker="64"><p> <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-09/WRAP-Recycling-Tracker-2021-report.pdfht"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-09/WRAP-Recycling-Tracker-2021-report.pdf</u><u>ht</u></a></p></authorialNote>. “The council doesn’t collect enough things for recycling” is another key barrier that households identify<authorialNote marker="65"><p> WRAP, 2020, Banbury, Recycling behaviours and attitudes 2020, Prepared by WRAP, available at <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-03/WRAP-Recycling-Tracker-Report-2020-March-2020.pdf"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-03/WRAP-Recycling-Tracker-Report-2020-March-2020.pdf</u></a></p></authorialNote>.

          <p>Our analysis suggests that certain collection systems might result in cost savings for local authorities in the medium to long-term (e.g., savings associated with residual waste). However, some authorities may see the change as a risk, increasing their cost burden in the short-term (e.g., to cover the costs of transitioning to a new collection system)<authorialNote marker="69"><p> Based on discussions with LAs during the first and second consultation.</p></authorialNote>. Also, future savings depend on an uncertain income from selling collected materials and a reduction in gate fees’ payments, compared with what local authorities are used to paying at the moment. As such, local authorities are likely to avoid changing collection systems under current circumstances, i.e., due to clear upfront costs but uncertain long-term savings. </p>

Recycling collection charges per ‘bin-empty’ are lower than for residual bins due to the higher value of the material and their lower disposal costs compared to refuse. However, diverting some recyclable waste from the refuse bin still, almost certainly, means that a refuse container is required despite it becoming less full.

Also, the majority of the charges for commercial collections relate to the operational delivery cost (e.g., labour) and not the treatment of the material. </p>

          <p>High participation in recycling services could improve the economies of scale in waste collection. For waste-generating businesses to see cost savings, there needs to be several businesses adopting a preferred collection regime. This is because of the cost overhead involved for a collection vehicle to get to a business’ site. Similarly, waste management companies would need to see changes in their waste management costs in order to pass some of these savings on to affected businesses through higher revenues for separated material or savings in landfill tax. It is thus possible that a co-ordination issue has prevented the realisation of these benefits. </p>

          <p>In this analysis, we use current market prices for the charges for container collections. These reflect current low levels of participation and separation of recyclable material. A key benefit of intervention through legislation could be that the higher presentation rates of recyclable materials reduce the charges to businesses. Charges could reduce from improvements in the efficiency of collection, making better use of collection assets and increased revenue from the capture of more recyclable materials. However, given the complexity in charging and the range of NHM businesses, a future reduction in container charges has not been assumed in this assessment.</p>

These waste streams are glass, metal, plastic, paper and card, food waste, and, for households only, garden waste<authorialNote marker="80"><p> The management of waste items such as nappies and paint are not considered as part of consistent kerbside collection.

Similarly, our current estimate of business presented recycling rate is 43.3%. That is why the Government has brought forward legislative changes to accelerate recycling rates, towards a target of 65% recycling rate for municipal waste by 2035. The Government is undertaking the decisions outlined below because it believes that they will serve as a basis for increasing recycling by making recycling more consistent and more straightforward for households, businesses, and non-domestic premises in England.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, requiring separate food waste collections will ensure that food waste can be sent to anaerobic digestion sites where it generates biofuel and digestate, a nutrient-rich fertiliser, rather than landfill, where it releases methane and contributes to the generation of leachates.</p>

          <p>In accordance with the Environment Act 2021, the Secretary of State can provide an exemption to allow for the co-collection of recyclable materials if satisfied that their co-collection does not significantly impact the ability of these materials to be recycled or composted. Based on stakeholder feedback from the consultation and evidence regarding co-collection of all dry recyclables, the Secretary of State for Defra understands that paper and card are particularly vulnerable to cross-contamination from food and liquid commonly found on other recycling, which could significantly reduce quality of collected material, while co-collection of plastic, metal and glass presents a lower contamination and material quality risk.</p>

      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Therefore, in order to achieve high-quality recycling, paper and card must be collected separately from the other dry recyclable waste streams, except where this is not technically or economically practicable, or where there is no significant environmental benefit from separate collection. If a waste collection authority or waste collector relies on this exception, it will need to carry out a short written assessment. We intend to set out further information on ‘economically practicable,’ ‘technically practicable’ and ‘no significant environmental benefit’ in non-statutory guidance, due to be published in 2024. Compliance will be assessed by the regulator in England, the Environment Agency.</p>

          <p>The dry recyclable waste streams (excluding plastic films) must be collected from households by 31 March 2026. The legislation date for households aligns with the end of the financial year in which EPR for packaging is due to commence. The majority of the materials listed are packaging, and as payments from producers will fund local authorities for the collection of the packaging materials, we want to ensure that local authorities will receive funding in time to transition to the new requirements. As per the new burdens doctrine, we will be providing transitional funding to local authorities where applicable in advance of need.</p>

          <p>Household 1hh and 2hh options are based on our preferred option from the second consultation IA, which has been updated to align with the requirements introduced by the Environment Act.  In addition, the Secretary of State intends to make an exemption in the regulations that allow for the co-collection of metal, plastic and glass, and the co-collection of food and garden waste, in all circumstances without the need to produce a written assessment. Paper and card should be collected separately from the other recyclable waste streams by default, unless a short written assessment is produced by local authorities and other waste collectors to demonstrate that it is not technically or economically practical, or there is no significant environmental benefit in doing so. Therefore, LAs and other waste collectors can choose how to collect recycling. For modelling purposes, we have assumed that local authorities choose to move towards collection systems with further separation in some cases (see Section 6 for more information). Please note the recyclable waste streams must still be collected separately from residual waste in all circumstances, and dry recycling must still be collected separately from food/garden waste. If a waste collector intends to co-collect food and garden waste from households at a frequency of less than weekly (fortnightly, for example), then a separate food waste collection must be provided on the weeks when the co-collection of food and garden waste does not take place in order to satisfy the requirement that food waste is collected weekly from households.</p>

They show that the majority of recyclable waste collections provided to the NHM sector are currently for mixed dry recyclables.

As such, we have modelled partially mixed dry collections (with glass as a separate stream). Please see Section 6 for more information.</p>

            <p>We explored a de minimis threshold for businesses to be exempt from food waste separation if they produce less than 5kg of food waste per week. This was part of the consultation impact assessment. WRAP’s analysis has found that most businesses produce this amount of food waste and therefore they would not be exempt from this requirement. Most responses to the first consultation agreed that businesses that produce sufficient quantities of food waste should separate it from residual waste for collection and recycling. Furthermore, this option would present difficulties to enforce weight-based compliance.  As such, we have not presented this as an option in the previous and current impact assessments.</p>

WRAP work with and alongside brands, retailers, waste management companies, local authorities, and Government to bring about real sustainable change. Recycle Now works at the forefront of consumer insights on recycling behaviours. Through the delivery of key campaign moments, ongoing citizen interaction, partnerships and Recycle Week, the annual recycling awareness week, Recycle Now works to educate and inspire citizens to modify their behaviour in recycling. The campaign is about 20 years old, e.g., the first Recycle Week was back in 2003. It is a successful campaign, but in isolation it does not deliver against the policy objectives proposed in this final IA. This is because this campaign needs to be accompanied with consistent waste collections which would then enable people to recycle the same materials across the country.</p>

            <p><b>National framework and guidance:</b> Local authorities are currently able to decide on a local basis what and how materials should be collected from households for recycling. This has led to a large variety of service collection profiles and current legislative or fiscal drivers are unlikely to change this (i.e., they proved to be insufficient to increase current levels of recycling which plateaued over the last 10 years or so)<authorialNote marker="100"><p><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/918853/201819_Stats_Notice_FINAL_accessible.pdf"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/918853/201819_Stats_Notice_FINAL_accessible.pdf</u></a></p></authorialNote>.  As such, WRAP and other bodies have been working very closely with local authorities to improve recycling<authorialNote marker="101"><p> <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/sectors/local-authorities"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/sectors/local-authorities</u></a></p></authorialNote>. WRAP, for example, worked with the waste sector to develop a voluntary ‘Consistency Framework’<authorialNote marker="102"><p> <a href="https://eur03.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wrap.org.uk%2Fcollections-and-reprocessing%2Fconsistency&amp;data=04%7C01%7CRaminta.Brazinskaite%40defra.gov.uk%7C4539bb3bca5e4c66181e08d8cdd415ec%7C770a245002274c6290c74e38537f1102%7C1%7C0%7C637485658069038447%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C1000&amp;sdata=DDbqb%2FZi%2B02AEnDkl4n6soCqEv5R2zVNKhN5Ufu7y2g%3D&amp;reserved=0"><u>https://www.wrap.org.uk/collections-and-reprocessing/consistency</u></a><u> </u></p></authorialNote>. The framework sets out a 5-point action plan, including specific actions on local authorities to improve their services with the support from WRAP. However, this has not been taken up by the majority of local authorities because of other funding pressures and an absence of legal drivers. Evidence of limited impact is shown in Figure 1, of very little change in overall household recycling rates, especially between 2015 and 2020. The Framework has been in place since 2016. It was therefore clear that further legislation was required in order to increase recycling rates, and it was not sufficient to rely on local authorities to keep improving recycling rates on a voluntary basis.</p>

Despite this, it remains the exception and requires collective action to identify financial savings as well as increased recycling. In addition, there have been no drivers (e.g., business residual waste and recycling services tend to be a very small proportion of overall business turnover<authorialNote marker="109"><p> <a href="https://www.cips.org/knowledge/categories-and-commodities/facilities/waste-management/how-to-develop-a-waste-management-and-disposal-strategy/"><u>https://www.cips.org/knowledge/categories-and-commodities/facilities/waste-management/how-to-develop-a-waste-management-and-disposal-strategy/</u></a></p></authorialNote>, see Table 5. below) and so efficiency gains in diverting more waste to recycling may yield comparatively low savings at site level and provide limited financial incentive to separate waste without the presence of regulatory requirements.  </p>

            <p>There are no requirements at all on those producing the waste to segregate recyclable waste or make arrangements for recycling collections. Simply relying on businesses to do the right thing has not worked and, as such, business recycling rates are much lower than household recycling rates. This is reinforced by the current estimated recycling rate of 36.5% in the NHM sector. </p>

We have also asked whether there are alternatives to legislative measures that would be effective in increasing business recycling. There were a number of comments, however, most of them were about additional incentives and/or businesses to support the proposed legislative measures. Several comments also suggested that commercial collections should meet the same consistency aims as household waste and recycling services, as this would enable common messaging to reflect recycling options at home and work. Concerning segregation of food waste for businesses, a large majority of respondents agreed that businesses that produce sufficient quantities of food waste should be required to separate for recycling.</p>

          <p>The household sector recycling rate stood at 45% in 2018/19 and is expected to remain unchanged by 2035/36. Waste arisings grow in-line with household projections with an assumed fixed recycling yield<authorialNote marker="118"><p> Yields represent material collected from the kerbside and therefore include contamination. The contamination rates are then applied per each collection system to derive the recycling tonnage net of contamination. See the ‘Key household scenario assumptions’ section in Annex A for more details.</p></authorialNote> per household each year. Given that there was very little change in overall household recycling rates, especially between 2015 and 2020, we assume that collection systems do not change over time. Although households identify “the council doesn’t collect enough things for recycling” as one of the barriers to recycling<authorialNote marker="119"><p> WRAP, 2020, Banbury, Recycling behaviours and attitudes 2020, Prepared by WRAP, available at <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-03/WRAP-Recycling-Tracker-Report-2020-March-2020.pdf"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-03/WRAP-Recycling-Tracker-Report-2020-March-2020.pdf</u></a></p></authorialNote>, it does require local authorities to invest in these services which is difficult due to several other funding pressures and an absence of additional legal drivers to strengthen associated business cases (as explained in Section 2).

          <p>For the baseline scenario we use the results from WRAP’s Routemap collection model to provide the net service costs<authorialNote marker="120"><p> Overall cost for all English local authorities of running their waste collection systems, net of revenue they generate such as the sale of separately collected dry recyclable material.</p></authorialNote> of waste management for both low-rise and high-rise properties. These costs are estimated to be around £2.13 billion in 2018/19, rising to around £2.31bn by 2035 as a result of projected growth in the number of households from 24 million to 26 million by 2035<authorialNote marker="121"><p> Population growth projections –  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-household-projections"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/statistical-data-sets/live-tables-on-household-projections</u></a></p></authorialNote>. The largest proportion (41%) of the overall costs are annual operating and communications costs (including staff costs), followed by annual bulking costs of dry recycling and treatment costs of food waste and residual waste (42%, covering the cost of sending waste to relevant facilities for waste treatment and paying associated gate fees), and annualised capital costs for vehicle and containers replacement (bins). This ‘net’ estimate also accounts for any revenues received through selling collected dry recyclates directly to reprocessors (e.g., paper to paper mills).</p>

          <p>We also adjust these baseline estimates to include the DRS effect. Based on WRAP’s modelling, we estimate an average increase of £93m to annual net service costs for local authorities from 2027 onwards. This is based on the materials removed by the DRS from kerbside collections. Although the tonnage associated with DRS materials do not affect the overall collection costs, they do affect bulking, treatment and disposal costs. There are some savings associated with residual waste disposal and dry material bulking. They are offset by increased costs incurred from the remaining material going to MRFs and lost revenue from DRS materials being removed. The former is driven by an estimated increase in MRF gate fees. WRAP has modelled a cost increase from c. £35 per tonne<authorialNote marker="122"><p> Based on an average gate fee across the country. Source: WRAP.</p></authorialNote> to £60 per tonne<authorialNote marker="123"><p> Based on the survey of operators that was undertaken by WRAP.</p></authorialNote> once DRS materials are removed from kerbside. Although there are increases in MRF gate fees in the baseline scenario, when compared against scenarios, the DRS effect still shows net savings. The DRS effect presented here is in line with the DRS IA. The latter effect has been estimated based on the tonnes of DRS materials removed and associated lost revenue for each material. </p>

          <p>WRAP created industry waste estimates for approximately 2.15 million businesses and public sector entities. This was based on 2018 data from ONS for the Inter-Departmental Businesses Register (IDBR), using local unit counts. The sector scope of NHM businesses included is defined by a close examination of European Waste chapter codes and their mapping onto data sources such as Environmental Agency’s Waste Data Interrogator (WDI) and Incineration data<authorialNote marker="128"><p> <a href="https://data.gov.uk/dataset/312ace0a-ff0a-4f6f-a7ea-f757164cc488/waste-data-interrogator-2018"><u>https://data.gov.uk/dataset/312ace0a-ff0a-4f6f-a7ea-f757164cc488/waste-data-interrogator-2018</u></a></p></authorialNote>, Defra Refuse Derived Fuel (RDF), Defra Household data, Defra C&amp;I study, Eurostat<authorialNote marker="129"><p> <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/environment/overview"><u>https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/environment/overview</u></a></p></authorialNote>, related-waste compositions and previous similar studies.

From the data on business counts, 83.4% are micro firms, 13.4% are small, 2.8% are medium and 0.4% are large businesses (Table 6 below). Following the CEP definition of Municipal Waste, the NHM sector includes six core sectors: Hospitality, Retail and Wholesale, Health, Education, Transport and Storage, Office and other Services <authorialNote marker="131"><p> It is important to note that only a small proportion of food manufacturers are included within the NHM definition.  This is because (especially with medium and large Food Manufacturers), they may have a significant proportion of their waste collected by a non-standard business kerbside collection service, more so than other Sectors. Examples of alternative disposal routes may be animal feed or food re-distribution.</p></authorialNote> . The non-domestic premises are included within these sectors (e.g., schools are included in the education sector). There are other sectors that produce municipal waste. However, these sectors were excluded from the main modelling given that the amounts of municipal waste that they produce are likely to be very small<authorialNote marker="132"><p> This impact assessment excluded Food Manufacturing from the NHM sector, given its small amounts of municipal waste.

The rationale for using local business units, over enterprise data, is to reflect the actual collection (i.e., logistics) of waste from businesses premises and associated costs; and not the business’ ability to provide a level of recycling provision most aligned with its business size (i.e., based on the enterprise business definition<authorialNote marker="134"><p> Enterprise definition: Can be defined as the smallest combination of legal units (generally based on VAT and/or PAYE records) that is an organisational unit producing goods or services, which benefits from a certain degree of autonomy in decision-making, especially for the allocation of its resources, <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/bulletins/ukbusinessactivitysizeandlocation/2021"><u>https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/bulletins/ukbusinessactivitysizeandlocation/2021</u></a>  </p></authorialNote>).

        <heading>The NHM sector is overall more complex than the household sector given its diversity and no organisation to manage waste collections between the businesses and the waste collectors (as a local authority does for households). In 2017 and 2018 WRAP have undertaken large scale surveys of waste container profiles from the NHM sector to help understand the baseline profiles for the businesses in scope and found that:</heading>

            <p>The type of collection for the NHM sector can vary from sack pick-ups, 120 litre wheeled bins, up to 1,280 litre wheeled bins and can provide collections of general refuse, mixed dry recycling with and without glass, separate paper and cardboard packaging, mixed plastics, mixed glass, and food waste <authorialNote marker="138"><p> Container and material types are known to vary even further for broader commercial and industrial waste streams, but these are not in scope since they would not follow the standard municipal waste definition. </p></authorialNote>. Waste management companies collecting waste from businesses tend to favour the customer (business) in using 1,100 litre waste bins for general waste. This is largely because the collection vehicles are suited to lifting this type of bin, convenient for the customers’ use and it is cost efficient for the waste management company in terms of operations.</p>

          <p>In addition, in 2019 WRAP also commissioned surveys of national pricing for NHM collections for a range of materials and considered variations across the country.

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Whilst charges for recycling services are lower than for residual waste, ordering more containers and services often results in more costs to the NHM sector businesses. Reducing or avoiding cost increase is possible where businesses and public sector units decide to cost-optimise their collections through measures such as reduced size for refuse containers, decreased frequency of collections or shared waste service provisions. All these measures are considered in increased recycling scenarios and are described in more detail in ‘Key NHM sector assumptions’ in Section 6. From WRAP’s survey of NHM businesses, it appears that part of the NHM sector is already implementing these measures, although to varying degrees. However, there are still businesses that do not have a recycling collection at all. They only have a residual collection or a very small recycling collection and there is lack of rationalisation. Coordination failure among businesses due to lack of information on support options available to them to minimise costs, may be a considerable contributing factor. For example, businesses (i.e., operating in the same work-space area) may have little to no knowledge of the amount of cost savings they could make if they made use of the shared service provision or collectively reduced the size of their refuse containers etc. Another factor limiting the optimisation approach has been the relatively low savings that might be achieved relative to the overall turnover and the perceived challenge in realising small savings.</p>

          <p>Like in the household sector, the NHM baseline scenario assumes that the sector makes no change to their current use of waste collection systems or collection frequency. We assume that the presented recycling rate for the NHM baseline is 43.3%, or 11 million tonnes of waste currently recycled (this does not account for process losses once material has been through MRFs<authorialNote marker="139"><p> These losses are included when estimating the amount of waste that is sent to landfill or EfW and associated carbon impacts.</p></authorialNote>). We assume that, out of this recycled tonnage, overall, around 80% are dry mixed recyclates (DMR) and 20% represent separate food waste collections sent for recycling<authorialNote marker="140"><p> Source: WRAP’s analysis.</p></authorialNote>.

          <p>Our central estimate in the 2021 consultation was 49%. We have lowered this estimate given advice from WRAP as well as further discussions with the industry. Technical experts from one large waste management company presented their internal analysis which demonstrated business recycling rate is significantly lower than our estimate<authorialNote marker="141"><p> The presentation was in December 2021.</p></authorialNote>. If this is the case, this means that we are very likely underestimating carbon savings as well as potential opportunities for further business savings concerning waste management costs under the proposed policy options<authorialNote marker="142"><p> This is based on the first impact assessment which assumed the NHM business recycling rate to be between 30% and 40%.</p></authorialNote>.  </p>

          <p>In the baseline scenario, we assume the recycling rate remains unchanged from year to year over the period covered and across all business sizes. Despite sustained consumer pressure on businesses to lessen their environmental impact, our evidence shows that the NHM recycling rate remains low, with some businesses not undertaking any recycling (see Section 8 for further detail). This consumer pressure has seen improvements in business practices regarding a reduction in the amount of plastic packaging used, a movement away from single use plastics, and the growth of the UK plastics pact<authorialNote marker="143"><p> <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/taking-action/plastic-packaging/the-uk-plastics-pact/whos-signed-up"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/taking-action/plastic-packaging/the-uk-plastics-pact/whos-signed-up</u></a></p></authorialNote>. Given that these are consumer facing initiatives, this could help explain why on-site business recycling rates have not improved. Additionally, whilst there has been an increase in consumer pressure for businesses to be more environmentally aware, this pressure from consumers is not unilateral. According to a YouGov survey, only 50% of consumers are willing to pay more for environmental or ethical brands<authorialNote marker="144"><p> <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/sustainable-consumer.html"><u>https://www2.deloitte.com/uk/en/pages/consumer-business/articles/sustainable-consumer.html</u></a></p></authorialNote>.</p>

          <p>It should be noted that it is very likely that we are overestimating the NHM recycling rate in our analysis (as per above). We have checked this assumption with a waste management company which has investigated the NHM recycling rate. As the NHM recycling rate has stagnated, and we do not believe it will improve as a result of consumer pressure, interventions are needed to increase the current rate of business recycling.  </p>

An actual recycling rate for the NHM baseline is slightly lower than the presented rate above. This is because the actual rate is adjusted to account for process losses (e.g., associated with contamination that makes recyclable material untreatable). We estimate this actual rate to be approximately 36.5%<authorialNote marker="146"><p> Based on our engagement with one large waste management company, we assumed that c.15% of recycled material is lost due once going through a sorting process. </p></authorialNote>( based on our engagement with the sector).

With legislative measures to compel businesses to separate their waste, the potential of increased recycling rate is significant compared to the baseline. It assumes businesses are required to collect these materials (excluding plastic film) by the end of March 2025. Plastic film needs to be collected by the end of March 2027.</p>

          <p>Here we describe the key assumptions driving the performance, costs and savings in household recycling scenarios (i.e., both low- and high-rise properties are included in the options analysis). There are a lot of assumptions underpinning the household-related modelling (some of which are <b>commercially sensitive</b>).<b> </b>The large number of assumptions relate to the complexity in delivering<b> </b>extensive collection services to 24 million households situated in local authority areas with wide ranges of deprivation and housing stock and with inter-relations between service profiles all being serviced by a mix of in-house and private sector delivery organisations. The complexity is compounded by limited national data reporting frameworks to help identify the key performance and cost differences between schemes, particularly where local authorities operate several schemes within specific council boundaries. As such, we provide a summary of our approach to household-related modelling. There are a number of self-contained studies underpinning the HH analysis and the summaries are referenced throughout this section. </p>

The analysis on this sector has focussed on the first two categories with the biggest impact. WRAP assume that there are 20.5 million low-rise properties and 3.3 million flatted properties in 2018/19<authorialNote marker="153"><p> WRAP analysis.</p></authorialNote>. Bring sites<authorialNote marker="154"><p> WRAP research on LA Bring Sites 2018.</p></authorialNote>, areas where local authorities or third parties provide containers for the public to deposit recyclable material, and Household Waste Recycling Centres are not included for reasons of poor data quality, particularly around cost, and therefore their performance is assumed to continue at current levels. </p>

          <p>The household sector analysis is undertaken from a bottom-up approach, which considers the known baseline service profiles of each collection authority in England. The data used to build the individual baselines is derived from WRAP’s local authority data on the LA Portal<authorialNote marker="155"><p> <a href="https://laportal.wrap.org.uk/"><u>https://laportal.wrap.org.uk/</u><u> </u></a> </p></authorialNote> which is derived from the national scheme audit undertaken and with performance data benchmarks created and processed from WasteDataFlow<authorialNote marker="156"><p>  <a href="http://www.wastedataflow.org/"><u>http://www.wastedataflow.org/</u></a></p></authorialNote>. </p>

          <p>The overall service costs of waste and recycling can be split into a number of key elements including the collection costs, material revenue from recyclates (e.g., for collection of dry material streams), required sorting costs (e.g., gate fees paid by local authorities to process comingled dry recycling through material recycling facility operations) and treatment and disposal costs (from food waste to garden waste or refuse waste). </p>

          <p>However, when scaling and comparing costs across local authorities, the comparison is extremely difficult due to different local circumstances<authorialNote marker="157"><p> Such as different property types and travel distances through conurbations and onto treatment end-destinations.</p></authorialNote>, different services included within local authority expenditure and no formal method for local authorities to report their specific costs for kerbside or flats collections services. Therefore, WRAP developed a national cost modelling approach (Indicative Cost and Performance study) to establish standardised costs to enable fairer comparison between collection systems which reside in settings of varying characteristics. The modelling approach was endorsed and assured by an industry representative group when used in the national Consistency Framework.<authorialNote marker="158"><p> <a href="https://www.wrap.org.uk/collections-and-reprocessing/consistency"><u>https://www.wrap.org.uk/collections-and-reprocessing/consistency</u></a></p></authorialNote></p>

          <p>Due to lack of data, we have not been able to calculate the national cost based on the local costs for each local authority. As such, the WRAP indicative cost and performance assessments (ICP) uses average baselines for different areas that have common characteristics such as deprivation and geography.

          <p>The ICP3 modelling approach comprises a collection calculator using the Kerbside Analysis Tool (KAT) and incorporates sorting costs from handling of materials at depots and sorting facilities. The elements combine to generate a series of baseline models from which the new standardised costs can be generated. KAT uses actual scheme logistics timings collected from over 130 hours of filming a wide range of collection services. The tool shows how different waste flows are linked in a way that enables the achievement of significant collection savings in refuse collection and disposal activity via high recycling scenarios. KAT is typically used for individual local authority support projects and is the lead cost calculator tool used by local authorities and consultants for the last 15 years in over 400 separate analyses. It is used to produce bespoke and transparent kerbside analyses to account for aspects such as service profile, local operational efficiency and recycling performance that could be achieved in the council area. The KAT model looks at services holistically where increases in recycling performance affect the yields of remaining refuse waste needing to be collected and the resources needed to provide the services in desired policy scenarios.</p>

          <p>Previous WRAP research looking at variables affecting recycling rates showed that the level of economic deprivation and rural nature of the area are two important contextual factors that have a significant impact on kerbside recycling performance and collection service efficiency<authorialNote marker="162"><p> <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/resources/report/factors-influencing-recycling-performance">Factors influencing recycling performance | WRAP</a>:<u> </u><a href="https://wrap.org.uk/resources/report/factors-influencing-recycling-performance"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/resources/report/factors-influencing-recycling-performance#:~:text=The%20factors%20found%20to%20be%20influential%20in%20affecting,dry%20recycling%20achieving%20higher%20kerbside%20dry%20recycling%20yields%3B</u></a><u> </u></p></authorialNote>. This also affects workload for crews and, consequently, collection infrastructure and associated costs to local authorities. The consultation impact assessments were modelled using the six-part rurality classification in line with ICP2. Following a peer review of the rurality classifications it was decided that the existing approach to segmenting local authorities was fit for purpose but there was a case to divide the existing groups further. ICP3 modelling, including this impact assessment, has been updated with nine rurality groups by including a third category for deprivation (i.e., middle deprivation).  </p>

          <p>These nine groups consist of a three-part geographical classification and three levels of deprivation thresholds.

This is based on the total population of LSOAs (Census 2011) which are defined as: predominantly urban (less than 8% of population is defined as ‘rural’); mixed urban and rural (more than 8% but less than 30% of population is defined as ‘rural’); and predominantly rural (more than 30% of population defined as rural). The deprivation thresholds were calculated using a line of best fit between the proportion of population that is rural, and the percentage of population in social grades D and E. This splits the local authorities into two groups of higher and lower deprivation. A middle deprivation group was formed by applying an offset of 50% of one standard deviation either side of the line of best fit to span one standard deviation. Figure 2 below summarises the nine rurality groups.</p>

The cost codes for each rurality group then feed into WRAP’s Routemap model where they are mapped on to each local authority’s area profile relative to the housing stock and property numbers. The cost codes are used for the baseline scenarios and can be changed to alternative cost codes depending on the preferred policy scenarios for the impact assessment.</p>

          <p>The aim of the Routemap model is to aggregate the individual local authority data for cost and performance and run new scenarios over a future time series to show the annual costs via a range of cost categories. The scenarios are applied to each local authority according to when each can change and are phased in according to contract status, the service in place already and the size of the authority. The application of scenarios over time is important given the large-scale procurement and implementation challenges each local authority would face in adopting the new Government scenarios by the target dates set in legislation. </p>

          <p>In general, the projections from Routemap are based upon observed data in authorities where a particular collection regime has been introduced. It may be that certain local factors, not accounted for in the modelling such as service quality of delivery, will affect the yields and prices in ways not reflected in these cases. Moreover, although there will be an exemption allowing for mixed collections of plastic, metal and glass, in the modelling we assume that local authorities choose to move towards systems with further separation in some cases. This is because the trajectory has been towards more separation of materials from entirely mixed schemes on the basis of rising processing costs at MRFs and increased income from the sale of separately collected materials<authorialNote marker="166"><p> Engagement with WRAP.</p></authorialNote>. The impact assessment modelling objectives are to understand the average differences in scheme types and their associated performance delivery to help refine a way forward with national policy proposals. It is not the objective that the IA costs would be directly used to inform funding payments. It is recognised that further refinement and local data improvements would be needed to devise actual funding arrangements. </p>

          <p>Government confirmed its commitment to funding the net additional costs to local authorities arising from the new statutory duties placed on them through the introduction of Simpler Recycling. Concerning packaging materials, payments from packaging producers will fund local authorities for the collection of these materials (i.e., as a result of changes being brought by the pEPR scheme). We expect that funding and payments to local authorities will take account of equity and regional consideration by looking at rurality and level of deprivation and performance expectations. This means that the costs to local authorities will be mitigated to cover additional costs associated with deprived and rural areas. As such, we do not assume that local authorities would pass their costs to their households.</p>

          <p>As for price assumptions, all modelling is done based on constant prices (2020 price base) that do not change over the years. Material incomes are accounted for in sorting costs (i.e., these are net of income received for sold material) as well as in direct payments in scenarios where materials are collected separately (i.e., for fibres in twin-stream scenarios and separately collected materials in multi-stream scenarios). The material income is based on the average prices as reported in WRAP’s Material Pricing Reports (2019/20 values).</p>

          <p>Regarding the treatment and disposal costs, Routemap uses localised gate fee costs, where these are known. They are based on both Gate Fees surveys (from between 2018/19 and 2019/20) and individual local authority studies across various waste and recycling facilities in England. Where data cannot be sourced the regional average is used. This processing cost data is collected from local authorities and their contractors under arrangements that the data will be treated as <b>commercially sensitive</b>. To try to make the standardised costs closer to actual expenditure the values are incorporated into the Routemap model and aligned to the local authority area. The data is handled sensitively with limited staff access to protect the integrity of the local authorities supplying the information on this and other WRAP programmes. In addition, bulking and haulage costs are added relative to the scheme profile where required<authorialNote marker="171"><p> For example, for LAs who might need to haul food waste to an anaerobic digestion facility cross country, or to manage the transfer of segregated dry recyclables into bulk containers at a local depot.</p></authorialNote>. Haulage costs to transport the materials across the country to the reprocessors are also considered in the materials pricing where appropriate<authorialNote marker="172"><p> The Materials Pricing Report (wrap.org.uk/resources/report/materials-pricing-report) summarises the costs of transfer and which material streams have the haulage already included (known as Ex-works costs).</p></authorialNote>. Some materials that are bulked and hauled such as paper do not require an additional haulage cost applied since the price paid by the reprocessor already includes them in the value offered. </p>

          <p>There is a lot of uncertainty around the collection of plastic film (given that only 19% of local authorities in England collect plastic film) and its impact on MRF gate fees. We have assumed that the collection of plastic film will increase MRF gate fees by 6%. This is based on WRAP’s discussions with local authorities and MRF operators. We have included some sensitivity modelling on this estimate – see Annex B for further detail.  </p>

        <content>
          <p>WRAP uses data from Government’s WasteDataFlow (WDF) tonnage reporting system to calculate the collected tonnages of dry recyclables for each LA. The values supplied by Councils in WDF are aggregated totals for the local authority area and need cleansing and further analysis to calculate dry recycling yields per household for each target material. These yield benchmarks are created from analysis looking at collection system type, collection frequency, rurality and levels of deprivation. When an authority is assumed to move from one collection system to another the waste yield per household will change based on the above factors. Although there will be an exemption allowing for mixed collections of plastic, metal and glass, in the modelling we assume that local authorities choose to move towards systems with further separation in some cases. This is because the trajectory has been towards more separation of materials from entirely mixed schemes on the basis of rising processing costs at MRFs and increased income from the sale of separately collected materials.<authorialNote marker="180"><p> Engagement with WRAP.</p></authorialNote></p>

        <heading>The yields referred to above represent material collected from the kerbsides and thus include a certain amount of non-target materials, or certain level of contamination. Reporting of inputs and rejects from Material Recovery Facilities shows reasonable variation and inconsistency between data sets such as WasteDataFlow and the MF Portal and so standardised contamination rates are applied. A contamination rate is then applied to the tonnage collected and varies by collection approach with the following assumptions applied in the household model:</heading>

This estimate includes foil containers, plain foil, and imported premium pet food trays. There was no data for tubes, but Alupro advised that the associated tonnages would be negligible. The POM estimate covers both consumer and non-consumer foil. To calculate the consumer POM only, the proportion of consumer to non-consumer aluminium packaging reported in the Pack-flow Covid-19 metal report<authorialNote marker="186"><p> Valpak, 2020, PackFlow Covid-19 Phase I: Metal.</p></authorialNote> was applied to the above tonnages. Assuming 29 million households in the UK and a recycling rate of 56%<authorialNote marker="187"><p> 56% capture rate was applied as a best guess option as foil shares a similar property to film.

          <p>All household scenarios assume local authorities adopt separate food waste weekly collections at kerbside. While there are other options for collecting food waste, such as mixed food and garden waste collections, WRAP evidence shows that separate weekly collections of food waste can capture nearly three times as much material per year compared to mixed food and garden waste collections. However, given the exemption, some local authorities may choose to conduct mixed collections due to local circumstances, availability of AD and IVC facilities and existing contracts. More food waste tends to be captured through weekly collections when residual collections are on a fortnightly basis (as assumed in all household scenarios<authorialNote marker="192"><p> This assumption is based on the fact that the majority of local authorities (80%) currently collect residual waste frequently.

          <p>All household scenarios assume caddy liners would be offered to householders and are accounted for as part of the transition and ongoing costs to local authorities. Engagement with the sector suggests that local authorities and food waste recycling plant operators benefit from a flexible approach to caddy liner use, which is appropriate to varied local circumstances and treatment facility requirements. Local authorities are able to provide caddy liners if preferred. We continually review the evidence base and policy around caddy liner use.</p>

          <p>The liners are only supplied to participating households on an on-going basis to minimise wastage and are costed on the basis of compostable polymers so there might be savings made if cheaper polyethylene versions are suitable at food waste treatment facilities. The start-up liner packs to all households equate to £0.5 per household. Based on c.23.4m households in England, this equates to c.£12m start-up liner costs. The ongoing costs are around £1.5 per household (but could be £0.5 per household if PE bags are used instead) which means c.34m pa.</p>

This is primarily due to liners addressing householders’ key concerns of cleanliness of the system and that the liners should be free. Without their provision to householders, WRAP estimate around 20% lower yield per household in Year 1, dropping to 50% of expected yield achieved under caddy liner provision by Year 3.</p>

          <p>The performance at flats is calculated in the same way as for kerbside properties. Based on WRAP reviews of urban schemes, flats are assumed to achieve collected dry yields equivalent to 50% of that achievable at kerbside properties. The frequency of the collection for both recycling and residual waste is unchanged. For food waste the typical capture rate is 0.5kg/hh served per week. The service profile assumed for flats are bring style collections. Given the huge diversity in the design of housing stock for flatted properties it is only possible to present service costs and performance values from observed and monitored services. </p>

          <p>Following consultation responses from industry stakeholders, we have agreed with WRAP to revise the garden waste assumptions and associated modelling based on engagement with stakeholders.

Garden waste specific questions in WDF include Q10<authorialNote marker="199"><p> Q10 contains data for the collection of household organic waste from kerbside. </p></authorialNote>, Q14<authorialNote marker="200"><p> Q14 contains data for the collection of household organic waste via Civic Amenity (CA) sites at a Waste Disposal Authority (WDA) level.</p></authorialNote>, Q16<authorialNote marker="201"><p> Q16 contains data for the collection of household organic waste via CA sites, at a Unitary Authority (UA) or Waste Collection Authority (WCA) level. </p></authorialNote> and Q23<authorialNote marker="202"><p> Q23 contains data for the collection of material for treatment by WDA from which recyclates are back allocated to WCAs.</p></authorialNote>.

They then mapped these estimates against the type of service provision offered by different local authorities (e.g., a free garden waste service). LARSU, for example, provides information whether local authorities provide free or charged garden waste service. Based on this analysis, WRAP then calculated the average garden waste yields for local authorities which provide a free garden waste service (i.e., 151.53kg/hh/yr), and for local authorities which provide a charged garden waste service (110.98kg/hh/yr).</p>

          <p>Concerning household waste recycling centres (HWRCs), WRAP estimated that there is an 18.02kg/hh/yr difference in HWRC residual waste collected between a free and charged service.  This was based on Q14/16 in WDF. The same analysis of Q23 in WDF, "Civic amenity sites: household" showed a 13.23kg/hh/yr difference in HWRC garden waste collected between free and charged services.</p>

          <p>Given the above assumptions, WRAP calculated that there is a +/-0.99 kg/hh/yr arisings change moving from a free garden waste collection to a charged garden waste collection. This equates to a reduction of c.7,624 tonnes for all going to charged and to an increase of c.11,702 tonnes for all going to free. For modelling purposes, we assumed this is a direct transfer from the residual stream. All the tonnage related assumptions have been summarised below in Table 9.</p>

          <p>The analysis on local authority income from garden waste subscriptions considers what each local authority currently charges households for the service. WRAP uses surveys to understand the actual local charge which has been included in the baseline modelling. Some local authorities currently charge over £154m per year through the garden waste charging subscription service. There is a large variation in charging across England (£22-£97 per household per year for a bin type service, or an average charge of £43 per household per year<authorialNote marker="207"><p> Based on WRAP’s analysis, 2020.</p></authorialNote>). There appears no strong relationship between the level of charge and take up rate or the corresponding tonnage collected. </p>

          <p>Finally, to estimate the total local authority income in a fully charged scenario, we assumed that there will be a 30% participation rate.

This considers that there is some level of recycling/disposal knowledge, especially within larger businesses<authorialNote marker="210"><p> This is based on the estimated recycling rates per businesses size in the baseline. </p></authorialNote>.

          <p>The business classification used in the analysis follows the Standard Industrial Classification of economic activities at the 2-digit level and as such a wide range of businesses are included.

        <heading>Given the uncertainty in data, WRAP have developed four key sensitivities on the total amount of waste in the NHM sector. This methodology used data, among others, provided by the Environment Agency (EA) and resulted in the four main estimates because the EA data is not conclusive in the sense of:</heading>
        <paragraph>
          <num>•</num>
          <content>
            <p>In 2018 only 69% of permitted sites included site data in their returns. This could be for multiple reasons: they might have not processed any waste, they might have closed down, they have just opened, or simply did not include any site data.</p>
          </content>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          <num>•</num>
          <content>
            <p>There is no flow of data within the EA WDI, and so it is difficult to know the true path of waste from one facility to another and to an end destination. For instance, some waste is shown to go to a facility (e.g., transfer, or end destination incineration), other waste is shown to go to a process (Recovery), and so it is difficult to depict if the Recovery tonnes are counted in a Recovery site or if they are going to a recycling destination.</p>
          </content>
        </paragraph>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>This means that four sensitivities were required when making assumptions on the EA WDI, so every eventuality is covered. These sensitivities include tonnes shown as gone to a Recovery process (and not), and a proxy extrapolating site data submission up to 84.5% to reflect different levels of the non-returns of data.</p>
        </content>
      </level>

        <content>
          <p>These sensitivities were then each modelled by sector/sub-sector into waste collection scenarios and extrapolated to a national level to provide the NHM scenario results. For the purpose of this impact assessment, a median across the four sensitivities (i.e., 25.4Mt of waste) has been taken as our central estimate. We have included some sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of using different values of the total NHM waste tonnages. This is presented in Annex B.</p>

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>For NHM collections, the concentration of glass and paper in many of the subsectors in scope of the regulations, such as hospitality and offices, means that there will continue to be a good economic case for separate collections for certain recyclable waste streams to be offered to businesses<authorialNote marker="217"><p> Engagement with WRAP.</p></authorialNote>. Although there will be an exemption allowing for co-collection of metal, plastic and glass, in the modelling we have assumed that all businesses choose to separate waste into mixed dry recyclables (except glass), with separate collections for glass and food waste. We use this option as the most likely scenario on the assumption that the majority of businesses are likely to seek to reduce the space required for waste receptacles, using the exemption and exceptions as necessary. This is based on the national surveys of waste collections from businesses and waste collector offerings<authorialNote marker="218"><p> Source: WRAP.</p></authorialNote>. They show that the majority of recyclable waste collections provided to the NHM sector are currently for mixed dry recyclables. This is because most sites have limited space; and, also, not every business generates all the material streams in scope of reforms. As such, NHM waste collections will vary depending on local circumstances; due to the exemptions provided it may be likely that businesses opt to collect paper and card separately, but given the lack of robust NHM data, it is not possible to confirm the breakdown of separate paper and card versus separate glass. Therefore, we have modelled glass as separate.</p>

          <p>Similar to the standardised costing approach for HH collections, WRAP’s NHM model uses industry charge per container lift data for each service offered to a business. A 2019 industry survey was used to update collection charges from a wider range of suppliers across the country<authorialNote marker="219"><p> This has been inflated to 2020 prices to ensure consistency across all the analyses presented in this impact assessment.</p></authorialNote>. This data is then applied to the baseline and the container provision needed for future scenarios. The charges are derived from large scale surveys of commercial and local authority collectors and as such remain <b>commercially sensitive</b>. Industry reviews of SMEs and national retailers highlight contract prices that reflect minimal levels of discounting according to a range of factors such as duration, material ranges included, numbers of lifts per site, national or regional contracts.  </p>

      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Given the range of contract differences and scale of businesses affected in the NHM analysis it is not possible to build in discount factors into the individual site analysis. As such, the overall costs generated in the analysis are likely to be slightly overstated, particularly in the new scenarios when fully rolled out.  </p>

        <heading>WRAP’s NHM model calculates for each of the four sensitivities the tonnes of waste generated per year per business sub-sector and size. It then applies estimated waste compositions to convert tonnes of waste into volume<authorialNote marker="221"><p> Given sector’s use of the charge per pick-up rate for a service provided, tonnages of waste need to be converted to volume to account for the amount of space left per applied container.</p></authorialNote> and calculates the lowest collection costs from a range of different bin sizes per business. This means that:</heading>

          <num>•</num>
          <content>
            <p>If it is cheaper for the business to have a larger bin but collected every other week, as each week the bin is less than half full, then this is selected.</p>
          </content>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          <num>•</num>
          <content>
            <p>If two businesses were to share a larger bin (next size up as such) but have a weekly collection (because of double the amount of waste), then the price per business would remain the same as a fortnightly collection.</p>
          </content>
        </paragraph>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Alternatively, if the business was to have a smaller, less expensive bin, but collected weekly, the price would only be marginally more than the fortnightly collection alternative with two businesses sharing the service.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>The WRAP fieldwork shows micro and, to a lesser extent, smaller businesses using a shared provision more often than medium and larger sized businesses. The surveys observed some businesses already operating shared services and employing other options to maintain low charges such as backhauling of their waste. Therefore, the baseline and future scenarios for micro –firms are likely to be overstated and offer opportunities to reduce on-going charges.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Thus, WRAP’s modelled scenarios do account for some waste provision sharing with the smaller businesses, but only up to a shared provision between two businesses. This means that there could be more cost savings if more than two smaller businesses shared a waste provision. Due to lack of available data on size and numbers of premises in shared office or retail facilities, it is difficult to quantify take up and cost of a shared waste provision provided by landlords or site managers.</p>

        <num>•</num>
        <content>
          <p>Non-optimisation of collection services: businesses keep the residual bin currently used and add extra bins to place the recyclates in. This means that the cost of a waste collection with additional recycling bins would increase significantly, because one, or some bins, are not efficiently sized to the volume of waste generated.</p>
        </content>
      </paragraph>
      <paragraph>
        <num>•</num>
        <content>
          <p>Optimisation of collection services: businesses reduce the residual bin size in line with the amount of recyclable material diverted to the additional recycling bins.</p>
        </content>
      </paragraph>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>When including recycling bins on top of residual waste collections, optimisation is key to keeping the costs down for the business. The additional recycling bins are not necessarily a separate bin for each recycling material. They can and are often bins that hold multiple recyclable materials (i.e., dry mixed recyclables).</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Optimisation can be applied on two levels. The first is to reduce the residual bin size sufficient to the volume of residual waste that is left after the recyclable waste has been extracted and placed into recycling bins. The second is, on top of reducing the residual bin size sufficiently, to also have the most suitable recycling bin size appropriate to the volume of recyclate generated by the business.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>This means that the cost of a waste provision with additional recycling bins would be less and, in some cases, cheaper than a residual only collection. This also may mean the waste management companies would need to adapt their collection vehicles to lift the various bin sizes. However, it is suggested some collection vehicles already have this capability.</p>

          <p>WRAP has interviewed seven different waste management companies (WMCs) asking for their view on potential cost impacts in relation to the DRS scheme<authorialNote marker="222"><p> Interviews were conducted in March 2020.</p></authorialNote>. Their view was that the scheme is very likely to increase the costs of collection of materials outside of the DRS scope. This is because the remaining material will be a less desirable product because of its lower value.</p>

          <p>The views from WMCs did vary widely in the suggested cost increase to business charges. It was felt that the variation in charge increase was down to the individual business models operated, the proportion of DRS in the remaining container and its relative net processing cost. It is suggested that an overall cost increase up to 25% for NHM DMR kerbside collections may happen because of the reduction in desirability of these streams. Given the uncertainty around DRS impact, we modelled a 10%, 15% and 25% increase in the costs of DMR collections (based on views from WMCs). 15% is our central estimate. </p>

The data mainly relates to the plastic and metal beverage containers used in the hospitality sector. Although the POM data contains container data, the NHM waste compositions do not go down to the level of granularity. This means the reduction of waste has been taken out of all plastic, metal and glass materials and not just packaging materials.</p></authorialNote>. This sector is assumed to be the most likely affected by the DRS scheme and to have 1Mt of DRS materials<authorialNote marker="224"><p> Based on DRS analysis.</p></authorialNote>. To show the effect the DRS scheme will have on the NHM kerbside collections, we modelled an increased cost to DMR for all business sectors.</p>

          <p>Defra’s model estimates the mass flow balance across the municipal sector in order to estimate the number of tonnes treated by different methods and associated GHGs emissions under different scenarios. This is a complex model with a number of key inputs influencing the modelling results. It is out of scope to present a detailed assessment of the model here. As such we present the key assumptions on which our municipal-wide results (i.e., GHGs and landfill tax calculations) depend:</p>

          <p>To split landfill costs between local authorities and the NHM sector, we assume that local authorities send c. 18% ratio of their collected residual waste to landfill. The rest is assumed to be sent to energy from waste (EfW) plants<authorialNote marker="226"><p> This is based on 2019/20 WasteDataFlow data.</p></authorialNote>. We used this assumption for the landfill tax payment calculations to align with the modelling of the costs to local authorities.

            <p>We use both the EA data and WasteDataFlow (WDF) to estimate the total waste arisings for the municipal sector. We then use Defra’s model (i.e., FoWST) to estimate impacts across the municipal sector (including impacts associated with the landfill tax). We acknowledge that there are some potential issues with some waste codes, which means that estimates of landfill tax impacts presented here represent a maximum potential level and outcomes may be lower. For example, in our UK statistics on waste, waste coded 19.12.12 is defined as municipal waste (based on an agreed methodology with Devolved Administrations). However, our discussions with experts suggest that this code is not 100% municipal waste<authorialNote marker="233"><p> Experts from the EA and Local Partnerships.</p></authorialNote>. They also suggest that the code is not always subject to the higher rate of landfill tax.</p>

For this code, they estimated a mean level of biodegradability of 46.3%. Given that this study showed the presence of biodegradable materials concerning municipal solid waste, we have assumed the higher landfill tax rate for the waste estimated to be diverted from landfill. In reality, some waste coded 19.12.12 could be subject to the lower rate. Hence, our estimated landfill tax impacts cannot be directly compared with the data provided in the ‘Landfill tax bulletin’.</p>

          <p>Our GHG savings arise from diverting waste away from the residual waste stream (black bag waste) where it will be sent to landfill or energy from waste (EfW), having in many cases a negative environmental impact. In the case of landfill, biodegradable waste (food, garden, paper, etc.) can decompose anaerobically, generating methane, a potent GHG. For EfW, burning of fossil-based waste (plastic, for example) releases CO2 into the atmosphere. Despite the fact that both of these waste treatment methods usually recover energy, they remain for many materials a net GHG contributor. </p>

          <p>In the case of waste, emissions from waste sent to landfill and incineration<authorialNote marker="235"><p> Although incineration emissions are non-traded, the energy recovery component from incinerating municipal waste generates energy which offsets the need to produce that energy through existing UK power plants. That offset is counted as traded emissions savings.</p></authorialNote> are non-traded.  FoWST also assumes that emissions from in-vessel compositing (IVC) and windrow compositing are non-traded; and that emissions from AD are traded. Recycling is a mixture of traded and non-traded (avoided) emissions, depending on materials. Non-traded sector emissions are those outside the UK Emissions Trading System (UK ETS). Traded emissions are covered by the UK ETS.</p>

However, we continue to report GHGs emissions changes and split them in terms of whether they occur in sectors covered under the UK ETS (‘traded emissions’) or outside the UK ETS (‘non-traded emissions’). Following a cross-government review during 2020 and 2021, new carbon prices were released. The rationale for updating carbon prices include changes in international and domestic targets, and a better understanding of new technology costs and availability to help meet the targets. Published guidance is that ’traded’ and ’non-traded’ emissions should have the same price so that there is equal weight for emissions from the two sectors<authorialNote marker="238"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/valuing-greenhouse-gas-emissions-in-policy-appraisal/valuation-of-greenhouse-gas-emissions-for-policy-appraisal-and-evaluation">Valuation of greenhouse gas emissions: for policy appraisal and evaluation - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</a>.</p></authorialNote>.</p>

          <p>Since the second consultation stage impact assessment, there has been consideration of how our policy on consistency in recycling will interact with HMG’s GGSS<authorialNote marker="239"><p>The GGSS follows on from the biomethane element of the non-domestic renewable heat incentive by providing tariff support for biomethane produced via AD and injected into the gas grid.</p></authorialNote>. This relates to the supply of separately collected food waste as a feedstock for AD. There is some uncertainty on the relative contribution of both policies from diverting food waste from landfill and/or other destinations to AD plants. To avoid double counting between these two policies, we have assumed that all carbon savings related from diverting waste from landfill are attributed to this impact assessment; and adjusted carbon savings related to AD plants (e.g., energy production) from 2024 onwards by the amount included in the GGSS impact assessment<authorialNote marker="240"><p> <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1018133/green-gas-impact-assessment.pdf"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1018133/green-gas-impact-assessment.pdf</u></a></p></authorialNote>.

          <p>Paper and card should be collected separately from the other recyclable waste streams by default, unless a written assessment is produced by the waste collector to demonstrate that it is not technically or economically practicable, or there is no significant environmental benefit in doing so. Therefore, waste collectors will choose how to collect recycling locally, but all waste collectors are permitted to produce a written assessment and co-collect if it is deemed appropriate given local circumstances. Because of this, it is difficult to estimate how many waste collectors will choose to produce a written assessment in practice. Use of written assessments may also change over time, depending on local circumstances. Consequently, all the municipal sector options assume that all local authorities and waste management companies will complete a written assessment.</p>

          <p>WRAP estimated the costs to WMCs to complete written assessments. These costs are incurred over 2 years initially to undertake initial assessments and then recur every 7 years, based on the average contract lifespan and lifetime of vehicles. WRAP estimate there to be 6500 WMCs, who we have assumed will all need to complete one written assessment. This is much lower than the number of businesses in England because WMCs will act on behalf of multiple businesses at the same time. For this reason, it isn’t practical to divide written assessment costs into separate costs to micro and larger businesses. NHM collection rounds are comprised of a mixture of businesses, many of which are micro. Therefore, our cost estimates are the same for both options 1nhm and 2nhm. </p>

          <p>WRAP also assumed that all local authorities will need to complete a written assessment, with 42 local authorities completing written assessments every year prior to contract renewal; this is likely an overestimation due to the provision of the exemption to allow co-collection of certain recyclable waste streams without the requirement for a written assessment. We expect local authorities to review and if necessary re-do written assessments when contracts are renewed (around every 7 years).</p>

The total costs are estimated to be £210k (based on 326 local authorities in England) and is the same for both household options (1hh and 2hh). This cost is spread over the appraisal period with greater costs in 2024, 2025, 2030 and 2031 when initial assessments for all local authorities are completed.

            <p>We assume these savings are realised by waste management companies, and that they do not pass any of that saving back to the affected municipal businesses. This is because businesses tend to pay for waste collection on a per lift or bin basis (i.e., not by quantity of waste); and most of these charges for commercial collections relate to the operational delivery costs (e.g., labour) rather than the treatment of material, which varies per collection event. As such, WRAP has assumed that lift prices stay constant. </p>

            <p><b>Landfill tax impact on government:</b> there is a considerable reduction in government revenue from landfill tax payments (i.e., a lost benefit to government). This is a transfer to local authorities and NHM. We estimate that only 11-22% of municipal solid waste is sent to landfill by 2035 across the four municipal sector options. This is significantly lower compared to the baseline estimate (i.e., 34%). Reduced landfill tax receipts are as follows: £4,175m for 1M Option, £5,756m for 2M Option, £3,636m for 3M and £5,216m for 4M Option. This is based on our in-house FoWST model:</p>

              <p>We use both the EA data and WasteDataFlow (WDF) to estimate the total waste arisings for the municipal sector. We then use Defra’s model (i.e., FoWST) to estimate impacts across the municipal sector (including impacts associated with the landfill tax). We acknowledge that there are some potential issues with some waste codes, which means that estimates of landfill tax impacts presented here represent a maximum potential level and outcomes may be lower. For example, in our UK statistics on waste, waste coded 19.12.12 is defined as municipal waste (based on an agreed methodology with Devolved Administrations). However, our discussions with experts suggest that this code is not 100% municipal waste<authorialNote marker="251"><p> Experts from the EA and Local Partnerships.</p></authorialNote>. They also suggest that the code is not always subject to the higher rate of landfill tax.</p>

            <p><b>LA waste management costs (including landfill tax saving [transfer from Government] and DRS net effect)</b>: for household Option 1hh, there is a net increase in costs. This is mainly driven by introducing free garden waste collections across all local authorities, resulting in lost revenue from charging and increase in costs, for example, related to container provision. Option 1hh means that local authorities net costs increase by £3,513m (discounted) over the appraisal period. Under Option 2hh local authorities’ net costs decrease by £188m (discounted over the appraisal period). This is because our assumption is that all local authorities charge households for their garden waste collection. This increases their revenue which in turn reduces their costs associated with waste management. The presented costs above account for lower landfill tax payments that local authorities must make under both options; and are estimated by WRAP’s Routemap collections module analyses. </p>

            <p>Small, medium and large firms are all expected to reduce their waste management costs over the appraisal period. The cost savings are greatest for large firms, decreasing in order from medium to small (see “Small and Micro sized Business Assessment” in Section 8 for further detail). Concerning micro firms, their waste management costs increase under Option 2nhm. This has a significant impact on the total net NHM waste management costs given the large number of these firms compared to other sizes (e.g., small). It is common for micro firms to only have residual bins which means that they need to increase their number of bins in order to align with the new requirements; and this increases their costs.

We are unable to do this as the data quality of WasteDataFlow (WDF) limits details of the end destinations of materials (limited descriptions, missing/incomplete responses, limited auditing). Until better auditing and completions are made, it is very difficult to identify the treatment process used for recycling (i.e., closed-loop vs open-loop) and in-turn the GHG benefit. For purposes of our modelling, we assumed closed-loop recycling<authorialNote marker="254"><p> Closed-loop recycling means that materials are made from recycled content where the previous product was the same as the new product (the process recycles the same product).

          <p>Table 14 shows the breakdown of transition costs for dry recycling, food waste and garden waste collection changes, avoided capital and vehicles costs associated with mixed garden waste collections and residual waste collections, as well as wider transition costs. Transition costs are only modelled until 2030/31. This is because these are, by definition, temporary. It is expected that all local authorities fully transition to the new requirements in this period. They consist of additional vehicles, containers, and wider transition costs to enable local authorities to change to a new collection system (or to a new waste contract) or to add new materials to exiting collection systems. </p>

          <p>The total net transition costs are estimated to be £1,091m (undiscounted), with the highest additional expenditure in 2026 and in 2027. This is when we expect most local authorities to transition and implement separate food waste collections. Note the transition costs for separate food waste (presented in Table 14) are relatively low in 2026 (and other years). This is because some of the costs associated with separate food waste are included in dry recycling due to expected movement of local authorities towards systems with further separation<authorialNote marker="259"><p> Please see Section 6 for more information.</p></authorialNote>. As we assume local authorities will move towards further separation of collected recycling streams (as outlined in Section 6), we have used multi-stream vehicles in this analysis (collecting both dry recyclables and food waste). In some cases, local authorities may use a separate vehicle to collect food waste when this suits their local circumstances. Concerning the transition costs of separate food waste, they also include the provision of caddy liners for food waste containers. The costs of caddy liners provision are categorised as transition costs for the period up to 2030. After that they are treated as an ongoing operating cost to local authorities<authorialNote marker="260"><p> Engagement with WRAP and the sector suggests that local authorities and food waste recycling plant operators benefit from a flexible approach to caddy liner use, which is appropriate to varied local circumstances and treatment facility requirements.</p><p>Local authorities are able to provide caddy liners if preferred, however, there are currently no plans to fund local authorities to provide caddy liners to households. We continually review the evidence base and policy around caddy liner use.</p></authorialNote>. </p>

          <p>Table 14 suggests some local authorities are changing in 2025. This would be the latter part of the year given that most local authorities make decisions based on financial years<authorialNote marker="261"><p> Our analysis is presented using calendar years. However, the actual expenditure is more likely towards the end of 2024/25 (i.e., the second part of the financial year). </p></authorialNote>. These are local authorities that have moved towards systems with further separation of dry materials but with alternative collection frequencies and/or separate food waste collection (collected on a separate vehicle) in the baseline. These local authorities may be the first ones to start changing their services to align with the requirements (i.e., weekly separate food waste collections) under this option<authorialNote marker="262"><p> Most local authorities will be making decisions based on financial years. </p></authorialNote>. In doing so, they start to co-collect separate food waste on a stillage with the dry recycling vehicle. This affects how the costs are allocated between ‘dry recycling collection’ and ‘separate food waste’, as explained above. </p>

          <p>Table 15 gives the total net cost to local authorities across the whole appraisal period (2024-2035). It provides a breakdown of costs associated with vehicles and containers. These costs are £675m and £453m respectively across the appraisal period. They include both initial capital as well as future replacement costs. Concerning operational costs, there are some changes in year 2025. Local authorities are required to collect all dry recyclable materials from 31st March 2026. We have assumed in the modelling that they need to add these materials to their existing collections if they don’t already collect them. In turn, this increases their recycling rates and lowers net operational costs in 2025. The model, for example, estimates bulking and waste treatment costs (net of revenue for separately collected materials) to fall by £11m in 2025. These costs decrease further as more waste is recycled over the following years (i.e., £207m by 2035, or average savings of £166m per year). </p>

          <p>Taking into account DRS in the baseline and household scenario, there is a net saving of £624m to local authorities over the appraisal period. In our analysis, we estimate that the DRS scheme reduce local authority income from material revenue and increase MRF gate fees (see Section 6 for further information). The DRS impact also has a small impact on bulking and residual waste costs. The combined effect is greater under the do-nothing compared to Option 1hh<authorialNote marker="263"><p> This is because in the household scenario the loss of material revenue from DRS is mitigated by the increase in non-DRS material revenue.</p></authorialNote>. As such, there is a saving to local authorities. Option 1M assumes that local authorities introduce a free garden waste collection. This has two main implications on the local authority costs. It contributes to the increase of the capital and operating costs to local authorities (as mentioned above). Another impact on local authorities is the lost income from charging households for their garden waste collection. WRAP estimates the net lost income to be £1,647m over the period of 2026-2035. The lost income to local authorities is a benefit to householders. They save the same amount (i.e., £1,647m) over the same period because of removed charging.</p>

          <p>We have estimated that businesses will incur familiarisation costs in the first 3 years of the policy. These familiarisation costs include understanding new requirements, making changes to waste management contracts and training. Familiarisations costs to businesses start in 2024 (as recycling behaviour changes are seen from 2025 onwards) and are estimated to be £133m for all small, medium, and large businesses. These costs cover understanding the new requirements, making practical changes, and training staff. For the following two years (2025 and 2026) these costs reduce to £13m and are associated with training new staff only. Our assumption is that from 2027 these costs are no longer needed. This is because new staff members would be very likely trained to the same standard in their previous jobs and/or would have had a similar experience with their household recycling collection. For further detail on the monetised familiarisation costs, see Section 6.</p>

          <p>Concerning waste management costs (not including DRS effect), we assume that businesses change their waste collections from 2025 onwards. This means the following:</p>

          <p>Large businesses: the baseline waste management costs for these businesses are £350m per year. These costs are estimated to decrease by £37.6m per year in 2025 and 2026. However, the cost decrease from 2027 onwards is lower, i.e., £28.6m. This is because there is a requirement to start recycling plastic film which in turn increases lift prices. </p>

          <p>Overall, this policy option decreases the total waste management costs for the sector from £4.00bn to £3.92bn per year (from 2027 onwards). The total impact is a saving of £1,028m in terms of waste management costs (undiscounted and over the total appraisal period).</p>

          <p>The cost of completing written assessments to WMCs is estimated at £4m over the appraisal period (undiscounted). Some LAs who provide a service to businesses producing NHM waste may incur associated written assessment costs, however as they can charge most users of the service, we expect any additional costs to be recovered through the cost of service. </p>

          <p>We estimate that the DRS scheme will increase the costs to waste management companies by £379m (relative to the baseline and over the appraisal period). This is based on 15% increase in the costs of dry material recycling collections under both the do-nothing and Option 1nhm. </p>

          <p>Under this option, the business recycling rate increases from 36.5% to 48.4%. This means that there is less business waste sent to landfill and EfW. Based on a Defra in-house model FoWST, we estimate landfill tax payments to reduce by £419m per year (i.e., average estimate across years of change). The total saving is £5,029m over the total appraisal period. Some of this saving will be as a result of diverting residual waste from landfill to EfW due to spare EfW capacity (as local authorities divert their waste to recycling). Table 16 provides a summary of the annual costs to the NHM sector (including savings associated with the landfill tax payments).</p>

          <p>We estimate that the changes in the recycling rate deliver carbon savings of £9,845m over the total appraisal (undiscounted). This is based on 34.7Mt CO2e saved over the total appraisal. For further detail see Annex C.</p>

          <p>The total policy support costs paid by government are estimated to be £78m over the total appraisal period (undiscounted). These costs include set up, compliance and enforcement costs to the Environment Agency, and the building and running of the online tool used for written assessments. They also include household policy support activity (non-binding performance indicators, direct council support and national communications campaigns) and NHM policy support activity (outreach and tools activities, and national guidance).

          <p>Large, medium, and small businesses experience the same familiarisation costs as Option 1nhm. Familiarisation costs to micro firms start in 2026 only, a year before they have to change their recycling behaviour to comply with the new requirements. This adds an additional £249m to familiarisation costs in 2026, and £2m per year for the following two years. £249m is spent by micro firms on understanding the new requirements, making practical changes, and training staff. £2m is spent in 2027 and 2028 for training new staff only.  </p>

          <p>Under Option 2nhm, large, medium, and small businesses experience the same changes to their waste management costs as per Option 1nhm. For large businesses, the baseline costs of £350m decrease by £37.7m per year, or by £28.6m per year once plastic film has been included in the recyclable waste streams. For medium businesses, we estimate their waste management costs to decrease by £24.8m per year (Year 2025 and 2026) and by £7.1m per year from 2027 onwards. With respect to small businesses, their costs are estimated to decrease by £76.9m in 2025 and 2026 (i.e., years without plastic film collection) and by £47.6m per year from 2027.    </p>

          <p>Micro firms are no longer exempt under Option 2nhm. We estimate that their costs increase from £1,862m to £2,294m per year. This is £431m increase in their costs per annum from 2027 onwards (i.e., there is no change in years 2025 and 2026 because micro firms have two additional years to adjust, but this means that they are required to recycle plastic film after these two initial years too). Including micro firms into the policy requirements increases the total waste management costs by £2,856m compared to a saving of £1,029m under Option 1nhm. This is mainly driven by a large number of micro firms. For further detail please see Section 8 called “Small and Micro sized Business Assessment”.</p>

          <p>The cost of completing written assessments for NHM collections is the same as Option 1nhm. Although Option 1nhm includes micro-businesses, the cost of completing written assessments does not change as it falls on the WMC who in practise will complete assessments for more than one business collection at a time. Therefore, it is not possible to split out the written assessment cost per business.</p>

          <p>We estimate that the DRS scheme will increase the costs to waste management companies by £1,226m (relative to the baseline and over the appraisal period). This is based on 15% increase in the collection costs of dry recycling materials under both the do-nothing and Option 1nhm (see Section 6 for further detail). The DRS net effect is greater under Option 2nhm, given that there are more collections of dry recycling materials (as a result of micro firms). The NHM landfill tax savings are estimated at £6,918m (undiscounted) across the total appraisal period. Including micro firms helps to achieve a higher recycling activity (compared to Option 1nhm), by diverting waste from residual waste facilities such as landfill and EfW. The outcome of implementing Option 2nhm improves the NHM sector recycling rate from 36.5% to 57.8%.</p>

          <p>The combination of changes in the household and NHM sectors leads to an increase in the municipal recycling rate to 57.6%, up by 15.2 percentage points from the baseline. This is a significantly greater change in the recycling rate compared to Option 1M which is only estimated to achieve a rate of 52.9% by 2035. These numbers show the importance of micro firms in helping to achieve the policy objectives. </p>

          <p>Based on the recycling rate estimated for Option 2M, we estimate 48.9Mt CO2e saved over the appraisal period. This is equal to £13,919m (undiscounted). For further detail see Annex C.</p>

          <p>Table 21 shows the net municipal outcomes for Option 2M, which is the combination of household Option 1hh and NHM Option 2nhm. This option produces the worst net present value outcome of all four municipal options, at £5.0bn This is because it has the most expensive household and non-household sector options; and the environmental benefits (via higher recycling rates) do not offer the best return.</p>

          <p>Option 3M has Option 2hh which assumes all local authorities charge participating households for separate garden waste collections. In reality, some local authorities may continue to provide free garden collections to their households. Under the new proposals, there is a requirement for all local authorities to have separate weekly food waste collections and they therefore might provide a free service if they wanted to co-collect food and garden waste. </p>

          <p>Table 22 shows the breakdown of transition costs for dry recycling, food waste and garden waste collection changes, avoided capital and vehicles costs associated with mixed garden waste collections and residual waste collections, as well as wider transition costs. Transition costs are only modelled until 2030 because these are, by definition, temporary. It is expected that all local authorities fully transition to the new requirements in this period. They consist of additional vehicles, containers, and wider transition costs to enable local authorities to change to a new collection system (or a new waste contract) or to add additional materials to an already suitable existing collection system. </p>

          <p>The total net transition costs are estimated to be £793 (undiscounted), with the highest additional expenditure in 2026 (as in Option 1hh). We assume that most local authorities are able to transition in 2026. The net transition costs for dry, separate food and mixed food and garden collections are the same as Option 1hh. They are different for ‘garden only collection’ and wider transition costs. Concerning the transition costs of separate food waste, they also include the provision of caddy liners for food waste containers. They are categorised as transition costs for the period up to 2030. After that they are treated as an ongoing operating cost to local authorities<authorialNote marker="271"><p> Engagement with WRAP and the sector suggests that local authorities and food waste recycling plant operators benefit from a flexible approach to caddy liner use, which is appropriate to varied local circumstances and treatment facility requirements.</p><p>Local authorities are able to provide caddy liners if preferred, however, there are currently no plans to fund local authorities to provide caddy liners to households. We continually review the evidence base and policy around caddy liner use.</p></authorialNote>.</p>

          <p>Due to a lower household participation under a charged garden waste scheme, local authorities have a lower capital expenditure. For garden only collection, their transition costs are estimated to be £20m (compared to £315m under Option 1hh with free garden waste). In turn, this household option offers the lowest net transition costs of both household options, at £793m across the transition period.</p>

          <p>Table 23 below gives the total net cost to local authorities across the appraisal period. Under this option, the net costs associated with vehicles and containers are significantly lower, estimated at £437m and £262m respectively (when compared to Option 1hh with free garden). These costs include both initial capital as well as future replacement costs. </p>

        <content>
          <p>As per Option 1hh, there are some changes to operational and bulking and treatment costs in 2025. Local authorities are required to collect all dry recyclable materials by the end of 2025/26. We have assumed in the modelling that they need to add these materials to their existing collections if they don’t already collect them. In turn, this increases their recycling rates and lowers some operational costs in 2025. The model, for example, estimates bulking and waste treatment costs (net of revenue for separately collected materials) to fall by £11m in 2025. </p>

          <p>The total net operating costs (over the appraisal period) are significantly lower (compared to Option 1hh). Again, this is due to lower household participation in garden waste collections (arising due to charges). Local authorities need to spend less on labour and other operating costs such as fuel. Under Option 2hh, the net operating costs are expected to increase by £2,375m over the appraisal, or on average by £216m per year. Under Option 2hh, local authorities are expected to spend less on bulking and treatment. The net bulking and treatment costs (net of material revenue and landfill tax payments) are estimated to reduce on average by £168m per year. </p>

          <p>Taking into account DRS in the baseline and household scenario, there is a net saving of £624m to local authorities over the appraisal period. In our analysis, we estimate that the DRS scheme reduces local authority income from material revenue and increase MRF gate fees (see Section 6 for further information). The DRS impact also have a small impact on bulking and residual waste costs. The combined effect is greater under the do-nothing compared to Option 1hh<authorialNote marker="272"><p> This is because in the household scenario the loss of material revenue from DRS is mitigated by the increase in non-DRS material revenue.</p></authorialNote>. As such, there is a saving to local authorities. The estimated saving is the same as per Option 1hh. This is because there is no interaction between dry DRS materials and garden waste.</p>

        <content>
          <p>Opposite to Option 1hh, this option means that local authorities receive additional income from charging for garden waste if they have previously provided this service for free but choose no longer to do so. Based on the household modelling, we estimate a net increase in income to all local authorities of £1,250m between 2026 and 2035. This is an average yearly increase of £125m. In turn, the household costs are increased by the same amount received by local authorities. </p>

          <p>The only difference is related to the savings to waste management companies concerning landfill tax payments. This is because changes in one sector have implications to shared infrastructure. Under Option 1M, the household sector has a higher recycling rate compared to Option 3M. This means there is more capacity, for example, to treat residual waste in a EfW plant rather than sending to landfill. As such, the NHM landfill tax savings are estimated to be £4,915m and £4,281m for Option 1M and Option 3M, respectively.</p>

          <p>Table 26 shows the net municipal costs and benefits associated with implementing Option 3M. This option has the highest NPV of £6.7bn (out of all options presented in this impact assessment). Option 3M demonstrates that allowing local authorities to charge for garden waste collections delivers a better economic value compared to a free collection (i.e., Option 1hh). Furthermore, it avoids additional net costs to the NHM sector by exempting micro firms from the new requirements (i.e., Option 1nhm). </p>

          <p>The familiarisation, waste management costs and DRS net effect to businesses are the same as per Option 2M (i.e., Option 2nhm). The costs to waste management companies to produce written assessments are also the same as per Option 2M. For further detail regarding these costs please refer to Option 2M description. </p>

          <p>The only difference is related to the savings to waste management companies concerning landfill tax payments. This is because changes in one sector have implications to shared infrastructure.  Under Option 2M, the household sector has a higher recycling rate compared to Option 4M. This means there is more capacity, for example, to treat NHM residual waste in a EfW plant rather than sending to landfill. As such, the NHM landfill tax savings are estimated to be £6,918m and £6,284m for Option 2M and Option 4M, respectively.</p>

          <p>We estimate that the changes in the recycling rate deliver carbon savings of £13,300m over the total appraisal (undiscounted). This is based on 46.7Mt CO2e saved over the total appraisal. For further detail see Annex C. </p>

          <p>The total policy support costs paid by government are estimated to be £78m over the total appraisal period. These costs include set up, compliance and enforcement costs to the Environment Agency, and the building and running of the online tool used for written assessments. They also include household policy support activity (non-binding performance indicators, direct council support and national communications campaigns) and NHM policy support activity (outreach and tools activities, and national guidance). </p>

          <p>Municipal Option 4M is based on the combination of Option 2hh (charged garden waste) and Option 2nhm (micro firms phased). It is our preferred option. Table 29 shows the summary of all the costs and benefits associated with this option.</p>

          <p>The modelled NPV for Option 4M is £5.9bn over appraisal period 2024-35. It has the second-best NPV out of all assessed options. Although this option does not deliver the best NPV outcome, there was a strong support from consultation responses for micro firms to be included in the new requirements. Including micro firms increases our recycling rate by 4.7 percentage points (compared to Option 3M). Concerning garden waste collections, we have considered value for money of using public expenditure. Additional environmental benefits and savings to households do not provide a strong enough economic case to fund these services. This is given that the Government is committed to providing the new burdens required for local authorities to deliver Simpler Recycling.  </p>

          <p>In terms of the demographic of businesses in England, micro firms and small businesses make up most of the business count, representing 96.8% of total firms according to the 2018 Business Count by Standard Industry Classification (SIC) class by employment size-band<authorialNote marker="279"><p><a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/datasets/ukbusinessactivitysizeandlocation"><u>https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/datasets/ukbusinessactivitysizeandlocation</u></a><u> </u>Using Table 4 from the 2018 data.</p></authorialNote>. The 2018 business data suggests of the 2.15 million firms, 2.09 million of them are categorized in the micro or small definition because they employ fewer than 50 people per business. Relative to the total waste arisings for the 2018 NHM sector, small businesses contribute 33.7% (8.6 million tonnes) and micro firms contribute 29.8% (7.6 million tonnes) of all NHM waste<authorialNote marker="280"><p> The total estimated NHM waste arisings are 26,916,889 tonnes based on 2018 WRAP NHM Baseline data.</p></authorialNote>. Amongst micro and small businesses, the Retail and Wholesale sub-sector produces the highest tonnages of waste arisings. Micro firms and small businesses from this sub-sector are estimated to produce 3.30 million and 3.44 million tonnes per year respectively<authorialNote marker="281"><p> WRAP modelling.</p></authorialNote>. Amongst medium sized businesses (those who employ between 50 and 249 employees), the Retail and Wholesale sub-sector also produces the highest tonnages of waste arisings, whereas amongst large sized businesses (those who employ over 250 employees), it is the Offices and other services sub-sector. </p>

          <p>Figure 4 below shows that, amongst small businesses, the sub-sector that accounts for the largest business count is also Offices and other services. The sub-sector that produces the highest total tonnage of waste arisings is also Retail and Wholesale<authorialNote marker="284"><p> Furthermore, compared to the last IA evidence base, there has too been a reduction in the number of Transport and Storage firms, but their waste arisings total has stayed reasonably similar.<i> </i></p></authorialNote>. Amongst small and micro businesses, the tonnage of waste distribution between sub-sectors is shown to be comparable. Therefore, efforts to drive recycling rates in sub-sectors can be targeted similarly between small and micro businesses. </p>

          <p>From WRAP’s own 2017/18 NHM Business Survey, the most frequently employed waste collection service for micro firms is a residual collection of all waste arisings, with little focus on recyclables. For small businesses, the most frequently employed waste collection service is a residual collection alongside a dry-mixed recyclables (DMR) collection or specialised collections on waste types. </p>

      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>In contrast, medium and large sized businesses are shown to employ a range of collection systems that include residual, dry mixed recyclables, food waste and separate glass. Therefore, small and micro businesses are more likely to have to make significant changes to the waste collection services that they employ. Medium and large businesses already employ a variety of ways to recycle so the largest gains can be found in the small and micro business recycling service provisions. This is to achieve the desired policy outcome in the municipal recycling rate. </p>

          <p>For micro firms, Option 1<i>nhm</i> will result in no change to their waste collection costs as they would be exempt from meeting the requirements outlined in the policy. This exemption would mitigate the cost increase to micro firms that would otherwise be seen if they were required to change their waste collection system to comply with the new requirements. </p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Option 2<i>nhm</i> shows micro firms changing to new collection services to be compliant with the requirements from 31st March 2027. This would provide micro firms two years more than other businesses. This phasing period would allow more preparation time for micro firms to comply with the requirements. These preparations may include procuring new service providers, setting up the in-house systems such as new bins, communicating the changes and training the staff, and optimising the waste areas such as removing extra residual bins that will no longer be required with the introduction of recycling bins. Direct engagement with businesses has shown that larger firms have the ability to change their collection services more quickly due to the characteristics they already have in place, such as single point procurement and more space. As such, allowing micro firms more time will support them to overcome some of the barriers that they face to meeting the new requirements. This will have an overall positive impact on the outcomes of the policy.</p>

          <p>Option 1nhm would lead to no cost changes concerning waste management as seen below in Table 32. Under policy Option 2nhm, there are two sectors that see projected cost savings, Retail and Wholesale and Health, whereas all other sectors see expected cost increases. Most notably, Offices and other services experience the largest net increase in costs, explained through their relatively large business count number but relatively small waste arisings. Offices and other services represent 62% of all micro firms and almost 20% of all micro firm waste. Therefore, the associated cost increase is relatively more expensive than other sectors.</p>

          <p>The indicative net costs per firm column shows that when accounting for local unit count, Offices and other service net cost increase is still the largest across all other sectors of micro firms. With the phasing period described above, the actual cost changes are not expected to start until businesses start separating their wastes from 31st March 2027. These costs would be higher if micro firms were to be required to transition at the same time as all other businesses, i.e., from 31st March 2025. </p>

          <p>Tables 32 and 33 do not include the cost of completing written assessments. This is because the costs are incurred to WMCs, and we do not know the extent to which these costs will be passed to the WMC customer. See Section 6 for more information.</p>

          <p>Table 33 below shows the effects of Options 1nhm and 2nhm on small businesses. These cost effects are equal across the options as there is no exemption or phasing considered when it comes to business sizes of this type. This is due to the cost impact being relatively smaller than for micro firms. Significant benefits would also be forgone with an exemption or phasing-in of the policy. As such, they align to the new requirements and will see their waste provision change in 2025, along with medium and large firms. Table 33 shows that there is no specific theme in cost or saving across the sectors for small businesses, and impact of the policy is dependent on the existing recycling profile seen in the sectors. The table shows the three largest net cost increases are in Education, Hospitality and Transport &amp; storage sectors. Savings are seen in the Retail &amp; Wholesale sector with similar indicative per firm yearly savings. </p>

          <p>Tables 32 and 33 above show the costs to small and micro businesses without considering the effect of Deposit Return Scheme (DRS). Below, Tables 34 and 35, show the same tables as above but including the net DRS effect. </p>

        <content>
          <p>For businesses, we expect the DRS impact to be largely driven by the hospitality sector (e.g., bars, restaurants, hotels) which has the largest amount of drink containers. We have removed these DRS tonnages from the hospitality sector only; however, the cost effect is seen across all sectors and business sizes as seen in the below tables (see Section 6 for further detail about DRS-related assumptions). Based on WRAP’s survey of WMCs, we modelled a 15% increase in lift cost prices for dry mixed recyclables. This is because the remaining material is likely to be less desirable across all sectors. The 15% increase is our central estimate. See Annex B for further detail on low and high sensitivity estimates related to the size of the modelled DRS effect.  </p>

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Including DRS effect in our analysis increases costs to small and micro businesses, using the high-level averages across performance years. The increase is £58 per business per year for micro firms, and £90 per business per year for small businesses. Despite this increase, small businesses are still expected to make a net cost saving to align to the new requirements. </p>

          <p>Tables 32 and 33 do not include the cost of completing written assessments. This is because the costs are incurred to WMCs, and we do not know the extent to which these costs will be passed to the WMC customer. See section 6 for more information.</p>

          <p>For small and micro businesses, there are varying outcomes in costs and savings per sub-sector from the change in service provision (as demonstrated in this section). These differences in savings/costs are mainly driven by the existing recycling activity (i.e., the baseline performance), the amount of waste generated and waste composition per sub-sector and per firm size. WRAP’s research on existing container profiles used by businesses suggests a varying degree of recycling activity per business types and sizes. However, the general rule is that the lower recycling the greater the potential savings in moving to a high recycling scenario (although subject to the amount of residual waste generated and diminishing returns). </p>

          <p>Across all the business sizes, the proposed policy has the biggest impact on micro firms. For completeness, Table 36 shows the impact on medium and large NHM businesses. For small (and medium and large) businesses there is some opportunity to lower their costs associated with waste management whilst helping to increase the overall NHM recycling rate. Amongst small and micro business, the most notable change in costs would be to the Office and other Services sub-sector. This is because this sub-sector accounts for 57.8% of all small and micro units. </p>

          <p>Tables 32 and 33 do not include the cost of completing written assessments. This is because the costs are incurred to WMCs, and we do not know the extent to which these costs will be passed to the WMC customer. See section 6 for more information. </p>

          <p>Our SaMBA assessment explains why we have considered policy options that exempt micro firms or allow them additional implementation time to make required changes. Given that the inclusion of micro firms increases our NHM recycling rates by 9.3 percentage points as well as increase our carbon savings by £4.1bn<authorialNote marker="292"><p> The additional carbon savings of including micro firms are dependent on the HH option. There are undiscounted carbon savings of £4.07bn under Option 1hh and £4.13bn Option 2hh.</p></authorialNote> our preferred option is 2nhm. This option was also supported by the consultation responses which showed that respondents believed that small and micro businesses should comply with the new requirements. Only 10% of respondents expressed a preference for a complete exemption. 90% of respondents supported the inclusion of micro firms, whether with a two-year phasing period (32%) or without any phasing period (58%)<authorialNote marker="293"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consistency-in-household-and-business-recycling-in-england/outcome/government-response"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consistency-in-household-and-business-recycling-in-england/outcome/government-response</u></a></p></authorialNote>. General comments expressed that there should be a drive for all businesses to ‘do the right thing’ for the societal benefits and that micro firms are instrumental to increasing the current level of recycling seen at business premises, which in some business sizes and sectors is well below the household recycling rate. </p>

          <p>The responses to the consultation showed some support for these measures. Amongst respondents, the most popular cost mitigation options were co-collection (20%). There was a similar preference for the collaborative procurement option ‘encouraging businesses to use shared facilities on a site/estate’ (19%). Just over a third of respondents (37%) believed that none of the options available aligned to their preference. </p>

          <p>Further work will be undertaken to assess the benefits of cost reduction options to businesses and to gather greater understanding from real world examples of these options by engaging relevant sectors. This will help to determine where non-statutory guidance would be useful to support businesses and waste collectors. It will also help to build an evidence base to determine the most effective policies for future cost support policies.</p>

      <section eId="section_12">
        <content>
          <p>As part of the Small and Micro sized Business Assessment, we have also analysed the impact of using the local business unit definition<authorialNote marker="294"><p> Local units are individual sites that can also belong to an enterprise.</p></authorialNote> in the WRAP NHM model and associated grouping per business size. The rationale for using local business units is to reflect the actual collection of waste from businesses and not the business’ ability to provide a level of recycling provision most aligned with its business size. By using local unit data in the central analysis for identifying micro firms in this impact assessment, this helps to better estimate correctly the total cost associated with the NHM sector, specifically around collection costs. This is distinct from the exemption we are proposing under section 45AZC of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, which will apply to any entity carrying on an activity or enterprise from a premises to which section 45AZA or section 45AZB of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 applies, which has fewer than 10 full time equivalent employees. In other words, the number of employees for the exemption will relate to the enterprise and not the local business unit. This methodology of using local units affects the distribution of costs per businesses size (i.e., results as presented above). This means that the costs and tonnages by business size refer to the costs and tonnages arising from <i>units</i> of that size rather than <i>enterprises</i> of that size i.e., the total cost given for small businesses refers to the total cost arising from all small units, rather than from all small enterprises<authorialNote marker="295"><p>An enterprise (group) is a group of legal units under common ownership. <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/methodologies/ukbusinessactivitysizeandlocationqmi"><u>https://www.ons.gov.uk/businessindustryandtrade/business/activitysizeandlocation/methodologies/ukbusinessactivitysizeandlocationqmi</u></a> </p></authorialNote>,<authorialNote marker="296"><p> A national restaurant chain is a good example. It is very likely that they have several micro and small-size units that belong to a small, medium, or large enterprise. </p></authorialNote>. There is a risk that it overestimates the impact of exempting micro firms; fewer micro firms will be given an exemption on the basis of employees per enterprise than employees per local unit. In this section of the SaMBA, we are interested in the total cost for micro and small enterprises rather than the total cost for micro and small units – reflecting that some micro and small units will be owned by larger enterprises. In order to calculate these costs, we need to know the breakdown of local units owned by enterprises and how many are small and how many are micro. </p>

We do not know the breakdown of distribution of these units, and this is why the main results have not been updated to account for the actual enterprises and their sizes. As such, we make assumptions around business unit ownership, and how they can only belong to enterprises of equal or greater size i.e., that enterprises do not own units that are bigger than the enterprise. This means that a micro enterprise can only own micro units and a small enterprise can only own small and micro units, not medium or large.

          <p>The ‘new’ cost change experienced by the adjusted micro firm sectors is relatively cheaper than unadjusted, as some of the cost is owned by the parent enterprise. This is seen in the per business cost across all sectors, moving from an average of £239 per business per year, to £228. A saving of just over £11 a year when reallocating costs by the unit’s enterprise size. As stated above, the modelling assumption that all the units owned by micro enterprises are assumed to be micro units means that its cost profile (once adjusted) is the same across all three scenarios. This is not the case for small enterprises. Below table 39 shows a small unit adjustment in cost profiles.</p>

          <p>Monitoring change is focused on our intended outcomes, namely reductions in resource use and waste production and improvements in waste management (for e.g. more recycling, less landfilling and less waste crime). The changes are part of a ‘golden thread’ which leads upwards to the objectives of the 25 Year Environment Plan, the Clean Growth Strategy, the Industrial Strategy, and the Litter Strategy. The framework of indicators is set out on page 139 of the Resources and Waste Strategy and shown below for ease of reference (see Figure 5). </p>

        <content>
          <p>The scope of household familiarisation costs would be constrained to households taking time to read and understand the new required way to dispose of their waste as set out in the Simpler Recycling reforms. This would entail households reading the materials distributed by local authorities and understanding the requirement to further separate materials. A public consultation related to household and business recycling in England did not return significant concerns over potential familiarisation and sorting costs to households to further separate their recycling waste. The question “Do you have any comments and/or evidence on familiarisation costs (e.g., FTE time spent on understanding and implementing new requirements) and ongoing costs (e.g., sorting costs) to households and businesses?” was asked. The group which contained households did not have any comments or evidence regarding familiarisation costs, or concerns about too many recycling streams<authorialNote marker="302"><p> “Consistency in Household and Business Recycling in England”, Traverse, Pg. 289</p></authorialNote>.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>We expect low household familiarisation costs due to existing communications between local authorities and households. Therefore, these costs are not monetised in this impact assessment. Currently, local authorities communicate with households on residual and recyclable waste collections by providing physical leaflets and hosting information online<authorialNote marker="303"><p> Based on an online search of local authorities’ websites.</p></authorialNote>. This means that households can check what type of bin will be collected on the collection day, and which bin specific material types should be placed in. In a recent recycling tracking survey published by WRAP, 60% of respondents from a total of 4,729 UK adults aged 18+ reported that they had received information from the council about waste and recycling collections, e.g., leaflet/calendar with a further 52% of respondents answering that they had searched for information about waste and recycling online or by phone<authorialNote marker="304"><p> <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-03/Recycling%20Tracker%20Report%20-%20October%20KPI%20Wave%20FINAL.pdf"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-03/Recycling%20Tracker%20Report%20-%20October%20KPI%20Wave%20FINAL.pdf</u></a> pgs. 15-16</p></authorialNote>. Information on Simpler Recycling is very likely to use the same method and style of communication between local authorities and households by only adding additional information on what and how materials will be accepted. Respondents in a public consultation estimated familiarisation costs to local authorities “between £2 and £3.50 per household for the necessary communication campaigns”<authorialNote marker="305"><p> “Consistency in Household and Business Recycling in England”, Traverse, Pg. 289</p></authorialNote>. These costs are included in our analysis on the costs to local authorities. </p>

        <content>
          <p>Furthermore, current public behaviour already involves separating some recyclable material from residual waste streams. According to WRAP, in 2020/21, 46 local authorities operate a form of multi stream collections, with a further 131 local authorities operating a twin stream for dry recycling<authorialNote marker="306"><p> Based on data from WRAP’s LA Portal from self-reported inputs.</p></authorialNote>. This means that the cost to households to modify their behaviour to align with systems with further separation (by sorting additional materials) will be minimal. There is an increasing public interest in ensuring that recyclate is properly disposed and reprocessed to protect the environment<authorialNote marker="307"><p> <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-10/WRAP_Plastics_market_situation_report.pdf"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-10/WRAP_Plastics_market_situation_report.pdf</u></a> pg. 23</p></authorialNote>, with 69% of respondents in a WRAP survey published in 2020 stating that “it is the right thing to do”<authorialNote marker="308"><p> <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-10/WRAP-Recycling%20Tracker%20Report%202020.pdf"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2020-10/WRAP-Recycling%20Tracker%20Report%202020.pdf</u></a><u> pg.6 </u></p></authorialNote>. Public interest is further demonstrated by the number of respondents saying they recycle regularly with a response rate around c. 89% (i.e., a very similar trend across multiple surveys). Furthermore, 56% of respondents reported recycling more than they were last year<authorialNote marker="309"><p> <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-03/Recycling%20Tracker%20Report%20-%20October%20KPI%20Wave%20FINAL.pdf"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-03/Recycling%20Tracker%20Report%20-%20October%20KPI%20Wave%20FINAL.pdf</u></a> pg.5</p></authorialNote>. </p>

          <p>Sorting materials will be made easier by the implementation of standardised recycling labels as laid out in the proposal for pEPR policy<authorialNote marker="310"><p> pEPR Final Impact Assessment, 2022, available at: <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063588/epr-final-impact-assessment.pdf"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/1063588/epr-final-impact-assessment.pdf</u></a> pgs. 7, 28-29</p></authorialNote>. Mandatory recyclability labelling on all packaging will indicate if packaging is recyclable or not. This will in turn facilitate consumers participating in recycling packaging. Additionally, when respondents were asked to rate their recycling and waste collection on a scale from 0-10, clarity on which items should and should not be included in their recycling collection was a larger issue than the number of separate containers needed to sort recycling into for collection<authorialNote marker="311"><p>  <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-03/Recycling%20Tracker%20Report%20-%20October%20KPI%20Wave%20FINAL.pdf"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-03/Recycling%20Tracker%20Report%20-%20October%20KPI%20Wave%20FINAL.pdf</u></a> pg. 19</p></authorialNote>. This suggests that households are already sorting their recycling, and that the lack of clear guidance on where certain materials should go is a bigger problem to households. Proposed consistency changes in collections, in conjunction with pEPR should make it easier for households to sort their material into the recycling bins. As such, we expect any additional sorting costs to households to be minimal.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Furthermore, as containers will be provided to households, we do not expect there to be any significant costs in adopting the new collections system. In our recent public consultation, stakeholders were asked whether certain materials could be co-collected or not. Respondents with concerns focussed on the fact that “households may lack space to accommodate multiple containers”<authorialNote marker="312"><p> “Consistency in Household and Business Recycling in England”, Traverse, Pg. 104</p></authorialNote> for separated waste collections. However, stakeholders did not raise any concerns with households facing difficulty in having to source new bins/containers. Our analysis, for example, assumes that local authorities continue to collect dry recyclables from high-rise properties under existing collection schemes (i.e., new dry recyclable waste streams are added to the existing schemes<authorialNote marker="313"><p> Recycling performance is based on the existing system. </p></authorialNote> (e.g., multi-stream, twin-stream or comingled collection)). This reflects that there are more technical challenges (including space) associated with these properties. As such, our assumption is that they have already been considered as part of existing arrangements.</p>

          <p>In this impact assessment, we monetised familiarisation costs and waste management costs for additional recycling to the NHM sector. However, we did not monetise the time spent by business employees to sort and separate waste in the NHM sector for the reasons explained below.</p>

        <content>
          <p>Once the initial familiarisation costs for workers have been incurred to understand and comply with the new requirements, workers will understand how to correctly separate the required materials. This means that any additional waste sorting costs (i.e., putting waste into the right recycling bins) should be relatively small, compared to the familiarisation costs and increased waste collection costs which we have monetised in our analysis. The latter reflects additional financial costs through commercial contracts with waste management companies. </p>

          <p>It should be noted that similar requirements will be placed on households, who will be able to transfer their understanding of separating/sorting materials to the workplace<authorialNote marker="314"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consistency-in-household-and-business-recycling-in-england/outcome/government-response"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/consistency-in-household-and-business-recycling-in-england/outcome/government-response</u></a></p></authorialNote>. Through mandating increased standardisation of materials collected for recycling across England, we expect to improve waste collection services and performance (i.e., this is because the current approach to recycling is fragmented and inconsistent across England). We also expect communications and clearer labelling<authorialNote marker="315"><p> Impacts associated with labelling are assessed as part of the pEPR IA.</p></authorialNote> to improve business and residential understanding of what can be recycled, leading to higher recycling rates by both sectors as well as lower contamination and greater compliance with the requirements. Furthermore, we have some evidence<authorialNote marker="316"><p> Based on WRAP’s evidence.</p></authorialNote> to suggest that business waste is less likely to be contaminated and is more consistent concerning the types of recyclable waste arising. This means that that sorting waste in the NHM sector should be even simpler compared to the HH sector. </p>

          <p>Although there will be an exemption allowing for co-collection of metal, plastic and glass without the need for a written assessment, in the modelling we have assumed that all businesses choose to separate waste into mixed dry recyclables (except glass<authorialNote marker="317"><p> Please see Section 6 for more information.</p></authorialNote>), with separate collections for glass and food waste. We use this option as the most likely scenario on the assumption that the majority of businesses are likely to seek to reduce the space required for waste receptacles, using the exemption and exceptions as necessary (see Section 6 for further detail on this assumption). This is based on the national surveys of waste collections from businesses and waste collector offerings<authorialNote marker="318"><p> Source: WRAP.</p></authorialNote>. They show that the majority of recyclable waste collections provided to the NHM sector are currently for mixed dry recyclables. This is because most sites have limited space; and, also, not every business generates all the material streams in scope of reforms. Given the flexibility available due to the exemptions and exceptions, this could reduce the amount of time spent sorting waste for employees, thereby reducing any opportunity cost of time to the NHM sector. </p>

Stakeholders which responded to the public consultation and our business survey<authorialNote marker="319"><p> We undertook the business survey in June 2021. The focus was to gather information on familiarisation and ongoing costs (including sorting costs) directly from business and business representatives.</p></authorialNote> included a number of individuals and organisations such as the British Retail Consortium (BRC), Food and Drink Federation (FDF), The Institute of Workplace and Facilities Management (IWFM), and the Association of Convenience Stores (ACS) and a number of Business Improvement Districts (i.e., BIDs, representatives of various businesses, including hospitality). Only 3% of the group which included businesses expressed some concerns over additional/ongoing costs. Respondents were unable to provide any estimated costs to inform our analysis. Given that only a small number of stakeholders expressed concerns associated with these costs, this further suggests that these costs are unlikely to be significant. Similarly, there were a number of workshops during the first and second consultations to discuss with stakeholders their business collections. Ongoing sorting costs (i.e., the opportunity cost of time) were not mentioned by any of the stakeholders as an issue to the NHM businesses. It is important to note that the majority of businesses (particularly large franchises in the hospitality sector) are already separating out recycling streams to some degree<authorialNote marker="320"><p> Based on WRAP’s intelligence gathered through their ground surveys as well as their work on various industry pacts and commitments (e.g., the Courtauld Commitment).</p></authorialNote>. In an open job market, staff will have some experience of separating recyclables from residual streams in one or more vocations which will increase over time. Given that there was no evidence provided and/or concerns raised over additional sorting costs via numerous stakeholder-related opportunities from a wide range of businesses affected leads us to conclude that these costs are insignificant. </p>

          <p>In this impact assessment, we have included ongoing policy support costs to Government. These costs include business support tools, outreach activities and one-to-one business support. These support tools will help to reduce the sorting costs for businesses by highlighting good practice in similar premises. They will also allow the targeting of additional resources to specific sectors if they are identified as having relatively higher costs than other sectors. They will also address stakeholder concerns raised about time taken to locate recycling advice on contracts, arrangement of containers and training. We have already commissioned WRAP to develop new materials, and refine existing ones, as part of an online business support hub. Part of this work will be to develop training materials which will clearly set out, to businesses and their staff, their obligations under the new requirements as well as advice on how to efficiently integrate new services into their business models. Some of these resources will be printable materials which can be positioned near bins to help staff to sort waste appropriately. These materials will help further minimise the time that staff will need to spend sorting waste. Defra is still exploring one-to-one business support options.</p>

          <p>With the implementation of business support measures (i.e., to help mitigate costs to businesses), stakeholders not raising waste sorting costs as being a significant concern, and waste sorting costs being relatively minor compared to other monetised costs included in the analysis, we have not monetised waste sorting costs for the NHM sector.</p>

        <content>
          <p>The implementation of Simpler Recycling is forecast to increase the quantity and quality of material collected for recycling across the four scenarios relative to the baseline. This reduces the amount of waste sent to energy from waste plants, landfill and other residual waste treatment facilities. Consequently, there would be less pressure on additional residual waste infrastructure across England. This is contrary to the reprocessing infrastructure for which demand is likely to increase.</p>

        <content>
          <p>Note that the costs associated with waste treatment (e.g., landfill) have been monetised as part of this impact assessment. As such, in this section, we discuss wider impacts on the key parts of the waste infrastructure, starting with recycling.</p>

        <content>
          <p>Both household options generate the same amount of direct dry material recycling. However, there is a difference in total dry material recycling due to indirect recycling. This is because some amount of recyclate can be recovered from residual treatment facilities (e.g., MBT or EfW). This indirect recycling will be affected by the residual waste composition which is slightly different in the household scenarios due to garden waste assumptions (i.e., free vs charged garden waste).  </p>

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Any further source separation of recyclable materials is likely to have a negative economic impact on some material recycling facilities (MRFs). Current kerbside collections have around 3.0Mt of dry recyclables collected as comingled material by local authorities. We estimate this amount to reduce to 0.7 Mt by 2035 (i.e., mainly associated with high-rise properties).</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Under all municipal options, we expect the NHM sector to offset the loss of supply of comingled dry recyclables to MRFs from the household sector. All NHM scenarios assume significant increases in the collection of dry mixed materials that will need to be sorted by MRFs.</p>

      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Irrespective of the above, it is very likely that MRFs will need to make some changes. This is, for example, to reflect changes in the composition of recyclate to include materials such as plastic films. MRFs might need to invest in technologies such as air scythes or vacuum chutes to prevent films being wrapped around rollers<authorialNote marker="321"><p> Based on WRAP’s advice.</p></authorialNote>. This has been modelled via higher MRF gate fees associated with additional materials (see Section 6 for further detail).</p>

          <p>Tables 40, 41, 42 &amp; 43 show the projected changes to dry recycling tonnages under Options 1M, 2M, 3M and 4M. For the below tables, we have given the breakdown for additional dry material recycling tonnages by sector. Please note that in the tables, HH and NHM tonnages only include direct recycling, whilst the municipal sector includes indirect recycling as explained in the glossary. Therefore, it should be noted that the additional HH and NHM dry recycling tonnages will not equal the additional municipal dry recycling tonnages. </p>

Note that, the feedstock mix assumed in this impact assessment is not the feedstock mix (formerly) BEIS would expect an individual plant to use, but rather represents the feedstocks that (formerly) BEIS might expect to be used for the total biomethane produced from plants under the scheme. There are large variations in the stock of existing biomethane plants, and HMG expect new plants supported by these proposals will also be heterogeneous. As such, there is significant uncertainty in the assumed feedstock mix.</p>

        <content>
          <p>We do not expect that there will be significant negative impacts on IVC sites. We assume this because whilst IVC sites currently use comingled collections of food and garden waste, it will be possible for IVC sites to comingle separately collected food and garden waste collections on site. Furthermore, new s45 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 (as amended by the Environment Act 2021) allows for the comingled collection of food and garden waste.</p>

      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>An area of concern for IVC projects is that there is a maximum ratio for the amount of food: garden waste that can be processed by IVC facilities. If the ratio of food waste was to increase to this maximum limit, then IVC projects would either need to source more garden waste or refuse additional food waste. </p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>IVC projects which have a merchant arrangement contract are likely to have to compete with the expansion of AD facilities on gate fees for food waste once their current contracts end. This might impact IVC projects, as they may have to change their gate fees depending on the level of gates fees at AD facilities.</p>

        <content>
          <p>Open windrows could be impacted by increased demand for garden waste at IVC sites. This is because open windrows use separate garden waste as a feedstock. If local authorities that currently co-collect food and garden waste instead decide to separately collect food waste for treatment by anaerobic digestion, there could be an increase in the quantity of separately collected garden waste sent to open windrows (due to its low complexity and cost).</p>

          <p>The policies would also likely have an impact on residual waste treatment facilities. Table 44 shows the estimated tonnage entering residual treatment (mechanical and biological treatments (MBTs), EfW plants and landfill) under each scenario. This projection is heavily dependent on the extent to which some waste is ‘untreatable’ by existing methods, as this is a factor which becomes increasingly important with higher recycling rates. Any reduction in waste going to treatment is also sensitive to the level of uncertainty in future recycling rates and future waste arisings. Table 44 shows estimated tonnages undergoing treatment under each option. Note that these projections are subject to significant uncertainty; in particular, the time profile is likely to have been distorted by the modelling approach (see ‘Key municipal-wide assumptions’ in Section 6).</p>

          <p>Some local authorities have long term residual waste disposal contracts that may be affected by introducing a separate food waste collection (e.g., some Energy from Waste or Mechanical Biological Treatment contracts). Because of this, we consulted on providing an implementation date for these local authorities which would require them to begin food waste collections as soon as contracts allow, with an end date to meet this requirement to be set between 2024/25 and by 2030/31. We recognise that there are exceptional circumstances in which specific local authorities may need longer due to long-term waste disposal (mechanical biological treatment and energy from waste) contracts that run beyond 31 March 2026 (the implementation date for households). Government is not prepared to meet the costs of varying or breaking long-term contracts. Therefore, in the government response to the 2021 consultation, we announced that Defra will provide transitional arrangements for certain local authorities where needed to avoid variation costs or contract breaking.</p>

          <p>Note that projected residual treatment tonnages for the MSW sector given here will not precisely match projected residual municipal waste tonnages provided in the Residual Waste Infrastructure Capacity evidence note. The evidence note uses forecasts produced as part of the analysis supporting the development of the Government’s Residual Waste Reduction Target. The Residual Waste Reduction Target modelling uses the Future Waste Arisings project, commissioned by Defra to forecast total waste generation figures for waste from households and non-household municipal waste, utilising a number of socio-economic drivers, as the basis of its business-as-usual scenario. It models municipal waste as the total of waste from households plus non-household municipal waste. Other key differences include the use of a non-residual treatment rate to derive residual waste tonnages from total waste arisings as opposed to a recycling rate, the inclusion of food manufacturing waste in non-household municipal tonnages, and that the Residual Waste Reduction Target removes 20% of waste code 19 12 12 from its definition of municipal waste.</p>

          <p>Additional recycling (including of food waste) can change the composition and tonnage of residual waste being sent for incineration. This can change the energy content of mixed residual waste, i.e., its calorific value (CV). Higher CVs imply a higher amount of heat being released during the combustion process. CV changes can have an impact on incineration plant throughputs, with higher CVs reducing the amount of waste a plant can burn and vice-versa. This could lead to additional costs to local authorities with long-term EfW contracts, which contain guaranteed minimum tonnage clauses. As such, Defra has explored whether transitional arrangements are required to mitigate these costs<authorialNote marker="339"><p> The terms for transitional arrangements were outlined in the government response on the 2021 consultation.

          <content>
            <p>The amount of residual waste going to landfill, in the period 2013-18, remained relatively constant at around 27 million tonnes (+/- 1 million) with the waste being comprised of three main types: soil and stones (42%), wastes from mechanical treatment (28%) and household-like waste (11%). In the same period, the number of operational landfill sites reduced from 170 to 155, with 75% of remaining capacity concentrated at 36 of the remaining plants. At current landfilling rates, the report found there are c. 6 years of permitted capacity for non-hazardous waste left at these existing plants<authorialNote marker="346"><p> This is not irregular for the landfill industry, where new landfills are generally built on future demand projections. </p></authorialNote> – though significant regional variations exist (particularly limited capacity in north-east and south-west areas). However, the Resource and Waste Strategy may mean this existing capacity extend this to between 10 and 12 years<authorialNote marker="347"><p> Based on the modelling presented in the report.</p></authorialNote>. </p>

            <p>Furthermore, it showed that many operators are actively engaged in reducing the number of active landfill sites. It is expected that the total number of active biodegradable waste landfills will continue to fall steadily over the next 10 to 15 years. Similarly, the companies – that were contacted as part of this project – have no firm plans to develop new landfill sites, however, this doesn’t mean future landfill sites won’t ever be built if needed.</p>

            <p>The importance of landfill is not to be misunderstood. Successful waste initiatives and better waste management practice will not completely eliminate the need for landfill sites. There will still exist some continued disposal of inert and construction, demolition and excavation wastes, and landfill provides an emergency disposal measure in the case of recyclate market failures, treatment plant breakdowns or incidents such as the Foot and Mouth outbreak<authorialNote marker="348"><p> Suitable residual void space at landfills may be required in times of emergency in regionalised areas e.g., an outbreak of foot and mouth could not be handled at an energy from waste plant. </p></authorialNote>. Some of this is already being reflected in individual strategies by the landfill operators, e.g., focus on inert, construction, demolition and excavation wastes. </p>

          <content>
            <p>Taking the above into account, and the advice from industry experts, the report finds it is unlikely there will be further additional unit costs (i.e., cost per tonne to landfill) associated with landfilling or aftercare costs. This is because the effect of lower gas production, predicted under the RWS scenario, is offset by the cessation of renewable obligation (ROCs) payments in 2027. These payments are very similar to the costs of landfill gas generation.  </p>

            <p>The overall deprioritising of landfill disposal has been a successful result of increasing pressures to deliver better environmental outcomes via measures such as the landfill tax and deployment of better disposal technologies. This will be further supported by the measures set out in the Environment Act 2021, including recommendations set out in this IA.</p>

By separating paper and cardboard into a separate stream, it may reduce contamination from plastic or metal drinks containers, which can cause the paper/card to become sodden and end up being rejected by MRFs as a contaminant. According to a report commissioned by Valpak, there is potential for a premium to be attracted for high quality paper and card recycling. A report investigating the impact of proposed packaging reforms estimated a £10 per tonne uplift for separately collected paper and cardboard, although this report notes that the modelled uplift was a conservative estimate<authorialNote marker="358"><p> WRAP, 2019, Banbury, The impact of proposed packaging policy reforms on the UK’s secondary materials markets, Prepared by Valpak and Verde Research and Consulting pg. 53</p></authorialNote>.</p>

        <heading>A local authority can opt to pursue a sale of materials contract over a service contract if they separately collect material. By pursuing a sale of materials contract, local authorities are responsible for organising the collection and sale of recyclate which they collect. Local authorities have several options on how they can decide to sell recyclable material which they have collected. These approaches are often influenced by the local authorities’ approach to risk. In order for a local authority to engage with the market and sell recyclate, they would need to collect information on tonnages, material grades, contamination/quality, cost/income per tonne. When agreeing to a sales contract, local authorities can agree on selling material at a spot price, a variable price, or a fixed price (it should be noted however that certain materials e.g., aluminium are typically sold on spot markets so this might not always be avoidable<authorialNote marker="361"><p> WRAP and Eunomia, 2021, Approaches to Material Sales: A Practical Guide for local authorities pg. 13</p><p>Available at <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-07/WRAP-Approaches-to-Material-Sales-Practical-Guide-for-Local-Authorities-April-2021.pdf"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/sites/default/files/2021-07/WRAP-Approaches-to-Material-Sales-Practical-Guide-for-Local-Authorities-April-2021.pdf</u></a></p></authorialNote>).

          <p>Based on the analysis for the household sector (presented in this impact assessment), WRAP were able to estimate that between 5,667 (Option 2hh charged garden waste) and 10,224 (Option 1hh free garden waste) additional collection related jobs could be created, depending on the household option<authorialNote marker="365"><p> Based on WRAP’s household analysis.</p></authorialNote>. This would be an increase from 21,459 jobs (baseline) to 27,059 (Option 2hh) and 31,616 (Option 1hh) jobs. There are more jobs created under Option 1hh. This is because garden waste collections tend to be more labour intense and have to expand significantly to cover all households with gardens.</p>

          <p>The above increase in job creation for the household sector do not include additional jobs expected in the commercial collection and treatment site sectors. The impact of the changes in service to the NHM sector would see greater increases in recycling collections due to the high proportion of recycling not captured currently in the NHM waste composition. Therefore, we expected further additional jobs to be created to service these additional rounds on top of household collections.</p>

            <p>The GGSS is expected to benefit from the separate food waste collections that is proposed under Simpler Recycling. As a result, there will be an increase in the quantity and quality of feedstock currently collected to be sent to AD plants. It is hoped that by increasing the quantity of separate food waste sent to AD, plants will be able to benefit from economies of scale as the quantity of food waste being recycled increases. This should lower the gate fees that local authorities pay. The GGSS IA notes that there may be benefits to innovation due to a wider expansion of AD plants. These include potential cost reductions in the construction and operation of plants from learning and wider deployment driven by the scheme.

            <p>Simpler Recycling will help increase the quantity and quality of materials collected, including plastics. The UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) Industrial Strategy Challenge is investing £20 million alongside £65 million of industry investment in four recycling plants to reduce landfill and incineration, recycle waste into new sustainable plastics and expand the range of plastics that can be recycled<authorialNote marker="368"><p> <a href="https://www.ukri.org/news/ukri-funding-puts-uk-at-the-forefront-of-plastic-recycling/"><u>https://www.ukri.org/news/ukri-funding-puts-uk-at-the-forefront-of-plastic-recycling/</u></a></p></authorialNote>. By increasing the quantity and quality of plastics collected for recycling, it is possible that these plants will be able to discover more efficient ways of recycling plastics into new materials as a result of an increase in the supply of plastics. Simpler Recycling will also ensure that there is a reliable supply of plastics available to be reprocessed. This is particularly important as different types of plastics will be needed at the new reprocessing plants<authorialNote marker="369"><p> <a href="https://www.ukri.org/news/ukri-funding-puts-uk-at-the-forefront-of-plastic-recycling/"><u>https://www.ukri.org/news/ukri-funding-puts-uk-at-the-forefront-of-plastic-recycling/</u></a></p></authorialNote>.

            <p>Requirements to collect additional materials will put pressure on MRFs and may drive them towards greater investment in new capital to reduce their operational costs.

MRFs may also further invest in new technology such as laser scanning if technologies such as smart barcodes become more prevalent, thereby making the sorting process less labour intensive and reducing operational costs.

This improvement in automation has the potential to reduce processing costs and increase competitiveness for UK recyclers.<authorialNote marker="371"><p> WRAP, 2019, Banbury, The impact of proposed packaging policy reforms on the UK’s secondary materials markets, Prepared by Valpak and Verde Research and Consulting pg. 150.</p></authorialNote></p>

          <p>That said, a positive effect of Simpler Recycling is an improvement in the material quality, including reduced contamination of the recyclate collected.

An additional benefit is that the improved material quality of recyclate collected in England can be sold on the secondary materials market at a premium price. Simpler Recycling will help England to continue to export to these countries, and/or promote the domestic reprocessing industry as a result of improvements in the quantity and quality of recycling collected in England. This has been highlighted in this Annex in estimating the reduction in the quantity of dry recyclables to be collected comingled by local authorities.

          <p>There are additional GHG savings from having waste streams with greater waste and recycling separation that have not been monetised at this stage. Collections under systems with further separation produces higher quality recyclate that is more likely to find a market and thus be recycled. This has not been possible to monetise here, as the data quality of WDF limits details of the end destinations of materials (limited descriptions, missing/incomplete responses, limited auditing). Until better auditing and completions are made, it is very difficult to identify the treatment process used for recycling (i.e., closed-loop vs open-loop) and in-turn the GHG benefit. For purposes of our modelling, we assumed closed-loop recycling<authorialNote marker="376"><p> Closed-loop recycling means that materials are made from recycled content where the previous product was the same as the new product (the process recycles the same product). Open-loop recycling produces a new product which is different to the previous product.</p></authorialNote>.</p>

          <p>Sensitivity analyses explores how the outcome of the policy scenarios may vary due to uncertainty around key input variables used in our models. This policy affects the household and non-household municipal sectors, and also has cross-cutting impacts (such as carbon emissions). As part of our sensitivity analyses, we scrutinised the quality of evidence and approach to accounting for uncertainty in both sectors. This was to identify relevant variables to determine how switching their values change the overall outcome of the net present value (NPV) for the four municipal options delivered in this impact assessment. The same methodology was applied to the cross-cutting impacts. </p>

This means that we combine several sensitivities (concerning both sectors as well as wider impacts) to identify the best and worst outcome; and how these outcomes differ from our central scenario(s). Low NPV estimates assume low benefits and high costs. High NPV estimates assume high benefits and low costs.  </p>

          <p>In terms of the high NPV outcomes (reflecting low service costs, high carbon prices and high capture rates for the NHM sector<authorialNote marker="388"><p> Through a higher capture rate (90%, rather than 80% assumed in the central analysis) of the total NHM tonnage that could be further recycled.  </p></authorialNote>), introducing micro firms with the phased transition is a less costly outcome compared to central NPV values. There are also additional carbon savings due to additional recyclate generated via a higher capture rate of 90%. This means there is a better rate of return (in terms of carbon savings) per additional business expenditure on waste management. The high NPV outcomes mean that Option 4M has the highest NPV (which has the second best NPV value under the central values). Furthermore, our sensitivity of high captures rates demonstrates potential for economies of scale, e.g., high levels of participation in recycling services mean additional recycled waste tonnages captured, which improve the efficacy of the waste systems by lowering operational costs. </p>

          <p>The low NPV outcomes have Option 3M with the highest NPV. This is the same outcome as the central modelling. Option 2M has the lowest NPV under the low benefits and high costs scenario. Again, the same order as the central modelling. However, the notable change is that this scenario no longer has a positive NPV due to reduced environmental benefits (via lower capture) and increased costs to both businesses and local authorities. </p>

          <p>Note that the separate household and NHM estimates do not add up to total municipal estimates. This is because changes in one sector have implications to the whole municipal sector’s waste treatment. Furthermore, the HH and NHM sector results are not GGSS adjusted. This is because there is no explicit assumption by HMG from which sector the food waste is sourced from. As such, these tables are for illustration only.</p>

          <p>Tables 54 and 55 present GHGs emissions savings with respect to the four municipal options. Again, only the central estimates are presented, broken down into traded and non-traded emissions savings. Overall, the emission savings are between 15.6 MtCO2e and 24.2 MtCO2e over the period of the 5th carbon budget. In general, the highest savings are observed under Option 2M, but they are only marginally higher compared to Option 4M. There are wider environmental and economic benefits associated with greater waste and recycling separation that have not been monetised at this stage (see Annex A). Both Options 2M and 4M highlight the importance of including micro firms in terms of carbon savings.</p>

          <p>Whilst this is not the main sensitivity analysis, we have modelled the effects of using higher carbon equivalent factors for methane on the municipal sector GHG savings. This difference is due to the different warming potentials of methane at different temperatures (i.e., AR 4 and AR 5 without/with feedback); and only affects our calculations on non-traded emissions in our impact assessment.</p>

          <p>Our central calculations are based on AR4, based on guidance from BEIS (former departmental name), but it is very likely that this guidance will be updated to require to use one of the AR5 values.</p>

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>For ease of comparison, Tables 56 and 57 compare the impact of CO2e savings in tonnages and monetary value between the modelling using AR4, AR5 without feedback, and AR5 with feedback. This is for the total appraisal period. Tables 54 and 55 compare the same impact, but only over carbon budget 5 (2028-2032). These tables demonstrate that the environmental benefits associated with our policy options increase when we use AR5 without and with feedback. </p>

          <p>This section discusses Covid-19 impacts on kerbside collections by qualitatively appraising changes in waste arisings, collection services and treatment facilities since the start of the pandemic. Covid-19 has also been reflected upon in the main sensitivity analysis to capture any potential longer-term impacts from the pandemic (e.g., driver shortage and associated impact on their salaries). It should be noted that the impacts of Covid-19 would be present in the baseline scenario as well as the policy scenarios modelled.</p>

          <p>According to the 2021 Association of Directors of Environment, Economy, Planning &amp; Transport (ADEPT) study (w/c 15th March 2021), which surveyed local authorities on the continuing impacts of Covid-19, there was some ongoing minor disruption to collections services. The greatest reported cause of disruptions to collection services (by 49% of responding local authorities) was staff absence due to self-isolation, followed by staff absence due to sickness as the second largest cause (with 37% of local authorities reporting), and third, the effects of social distancing<authorialNote marker="391"><p> <a href="https://www.adeptnet.org.uk/covid-19-waste-survey-results"><u>https://www.adeptnet.org.uk/covid-19-waste-survey-results</u></a> Covid-19 waste survey results w/c 15th March 2021 pg. 5</p></authorialNote>. These disruptions had an impact on the collection of household kerbside waste streams, as some local authorities were unable to maintain collections of dry recyclate, and some garden waste services were suspended<authorialNote marker="392"><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122#:~:text=In%202021%2F22%2C%20total%20local,cent)%20from%202020%2F21.</u></a> pg. 5</p></authorialNote>. </p>

          <p>Covid-19 had impacts on the level of waste arisings generated by household kerbsides throughout 2020/21 as shown by the published statistics on waste managed by local authorities in England. According to the release, there was an increase in household waste arisings and residual streams, whilst there was a decrease in the amount of waste recycled. The amount of waste from households increased by 1.8% in 2020 compared to 2019, whilst the amount of residual waste being treated increased by 5.1% and the amount of waste recycled decreased by 1.2%<authorialNote marker="393"><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122#:~:text=In%202021%2F22%2C%20total%20local,cent)%20from%202020%2F21.</u></a> pg. 2</p></authorialNote> .This increase in household arisings is in part driven by the amount of people only working from home or hybrid working in periods of restrictions.

Other treatment services were less heavily impacted than HWRCs. As such, we do not expect that Covid-19 will have long lasting impacts on the ability to sort waste for recycling (the percentage of MRFs and Transfer stations which have been operating normally has shown a slight improvement from 75% to 85% of MRFs, and from 90% to 93% of Transfer Stations from 27th April 2020 to 15th March 2021). This is shown below in Figure 7, which has been taken from the 2021 ADEPT study (15th March 2021) which shows the operational status of other disposal facilities from the 8th March 2021 to 15th March 2021.</p>

          <p>It should be noted that whilst there is continuing uncertainty over the possible impacts of Covid-19, the largest disruption to waste collections and commercial waste was during April to June 2020 as local authorities and businesses adapted to working under national lockdown and COVID-19 pandemic conditions<authorialNote marker="405"><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122/local-authority-collected-waste-management-annual-results-202122#:~:text=In%202021%2F22%2C%20total%20local,cent)%20from%202020%2F21.</u></a><u> pg. 32</u></p></authorialNote>.

          <p>Finally, we have seen reduced Covid restrictions and workers returning to offices. This leads us to believe that there are unlikely to be significant long-term changes, especially affecting waste arisings and associated policy preferences for waste collections. </p>

          <p>For the household and NHM analysis, we have used WRAP’s models and associated outputs. Defra provides a grant agreement for WRAP to focus on sustained analysis of waste data sets and collation of scheme profiles. These models have been developed over time and are based on a combination of data sources. The HH model was originally built for the cost and performance analysis of 2020 household recycling target and subsequently refined for the national Consistency Framework as requested by Minister Rory Stewart<authorialNote marker="407"><p> <a href="https://www.wrap.org.uk/collections-and-reprocessing/consistency"><u>https://www.wrap.org.uk/collections-and-reprocessing/consistency</u></a></p></authorialNote>. At the time, it was endorsed and assured by the national Consistency Industry representative group supporting the Framework. The model uses a combination of WasteDataFlow (WDF) and local authority data, which is supplied to provide standardised comparative costs for use in national or regional modelling. WDF is the web-based system for municipal waste data reporting by UK local authorities to government. It is funded and managed by DEFRA and the UK government and is made publicly available. </p>

          <p>WRAP also collects voluntary submissions of local authority data from their LA Portal (some of which are <b>commercially sensitive</b>, e.g., local gates fees). This data is validated through a local authority team within WRAP which interface regularly with Councils. The data captured via surveys are generated into series of benchmarks to present back to Councils on WRAP’s website<authorialNote marker="408"><p> <a href="https://laportal.wrap.org.uk/"><u>https://laportal.wrap.org.uk/</u></a> </p></authorialNote>. This is to support local authorities and aid transparency in understanding their performance and delivery of services. Similarly, the <b>commercially sensitive</b> data such as treatment contract prices are anonymised and presented back to users via the WRAP’s website<authorialNote marker="409"><p> <a href="https://wrap.org.uk/resources/report/gate-fees-reports"><u>https://wrap.org.uk/resources/report/gate-fees-reports</u></a></p></authorialNote>. </p>

          <p>All operators of regulated waste management facilities have to provide the Environment Agency with details of the quantities and types of waste they deal with i.e., waste received into site and waste sent on from site to other facilities or processes (NB local authorities are required to provide details of tonnages and end-destinations of materials via WDF). A key challenge is that waste reporting cannot be split at different business levels (NB NHM waste collectors service a wide range of businesses). WRAP undertakes large scale surveys of waste container profiles from the NHM sector to help understand the baseline profiles for the businesses in scope and then combines this with waste composition profiles and tonnage estimates for each sector. This is to generate site level profiles for the NHM sub-sectors (hospitality, education, retails etc.). They also commissioned surveys of national pricing for collecting NHM collections for a range of material streams under contract and considered variations across the country. Individual supplier details remain <b>commercially sensitive</b> although aggregated summaries are provided to reviewers for further assurance. Despite these surveys, the general data associated with the NHM sector is considered to be relatively poor. This is because of: (1) the absence of any formal waste reporting framework like WDF; (2) the EA data is difficult to attribute to a business site level; and (3) that there are 2.15 million businesses and public administration units’ addresses requiring collections that are not required to be reported. However, significant improvements to data are expected through the proposal of a Digital Waste Tracking system<authorialNote marker="410"><p> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-waste-tracking-service/mandatory-digital-waste-tracking"><u>Mandatory digital waste tracking - GOV.UK (www.gov.uk)</u></a> </p></authorialNote>. </p>

          <p>Throughout our analysis, we have made use of stakeholder feedback, including public consultations responses. We have also invited WRAP to participate in stakeholder events, where relevant. For areas with limited evidence (e.g., familiarisation costs to businesses), we organised a specific session with business representatives, followed by a survey to gather more information from a bigger group of stakeholders. We also directly engaged with industry experts to help test our analysis and our understanding about potential impacts on both the household and NHM sectors.</p>

          <p>Finally, we have conducted literature reviews, which we referenced throughout the impact assessment. Concerning international evidence, WRAP concluded through their review that international scheme profiles and associated funding arrangements are not directly comparable with our policy options (meaning that the impacts cannot be crossed checked). The evidence from Devolved Administrations was considered where it was available and was used to inform WRAP’s estimates on policy costs (see Section 6).</p>

          <p>WRAP is responsible for quality assurance (QA) of their own models as well as outputs. WRAP builds QA into its workstreams following the Aqua book guidelines and with proportionality to the analysis and intended use of outputs. WRAP uses a range of experienced staff to perform the calculations and a buddy system to review modelling inputs and outputs. WRAP’s approach also includes periodic external peer reviews where relevant. The external peer reviews come from a wide range of skilled contractors on WRAP’s frameworks who undertake the reviews and also who engage directly with industry to source and review assumptions.  In addition to WRAP’s QA Defra has reviewed the outputs from the model, however, have been unable to separately QA the model due to commercial sensitivities of the local authority and private sector contract data embedded within. </p>

          <p>GHG estimates from waste collection and treatment have been estimated using Defra’s Fates of Waste Simulation Tool (FoWST) model. This model has been built within Defra, using an older “WasteMan” model (used for the previous impact assessment) as a guide; FoWST is functionally similar to WasteMan but has been restructured to increase transparency of the assumptions and calculations. Calculations have been peer-reviewed for consistency with the Wasteman specification, and results have been sense-checked by multiple analysts. Calculations which are critical to the conclusions of this IA, including the GHG emissions from landfill and avoided emissions from recycling (both of which are significantly affected by the evaluated policies), have been subject to reperformance tests outside the model. </p>

Subject matter experts have been consulted on the sources of these assumptions and they have been documented. Key assumptions and limitations of the model have been communicated in Section 6 of this document.</p>

          <p>The appraisal period of 12 years is used for the main analysis to help measure our progress against the ambition to reach 65% municipal recycling rate by 2035 (that Government stated in the 2018 Resource and Waste Strategy). This is because Simpler Recycling is the largest contributor towards this ambition in comparison with the other waste reforms. However, we have also replicated the central analysis with an appraisal period of ten years (from 2024-3033, rather than the 12 years used in the main analysis). As this impact assessment assumes the Deposit Return Scheme is implemented as part of its baseline (i.e., it does not include packaging Extended Producer Responsibility), the DRS effect is adjusted to accommodate a 12-year appraisal period used in the main analyses to assess costs and benefits associated with Simpler Recycling. We assumed that the amount of DRS materials that are diverted from kerbside collections stay the same from 10-year to 12-year appraisal. This then allows the pEPR IA baseline scenario to assume both DRS and Simpler Recycling impacts. To allow a comparison of outcomes against the other major waste reforms (i.e., pEPR and DRS) – see Table 63 below.</p>
