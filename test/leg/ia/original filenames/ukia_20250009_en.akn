          <p>The proposed increases to maxima are necessary to implement planned fee increases in Spring 2025. The strategic case is to significantly increase the income generated through fees. This will be applicable to relevant immigration and nationality applications, to increase the proportion of costs in the migration and borders system that are met by the end user, rather than taxpayer funding. This will support the department in achieving a balanced financial position in 2025/26 and going forward.</p>

          <p>The objective of this intervention is to increase the income generated through immigration and nationality fees, to support the overall funding of the migration and borders system. In parallel, there is also an objective to ensure as far as possible that the financial benefit to the department of the proposed changes is not outweighed by costs in the wider economy, resulting from an impact on demand for the associated products and services.</p>

          <p>Following the increase in fee maxima, the government intends that certain fees within the relevant chargeable category of application would be set at the new maxima level in subsequent Regulations. Analysis supporting the future increase in fees charged to end users (rather than changes to the fee maxima) will be provided in a separate Impact Assessment (IA) alongside the legislation.</p>

          <p>A range of options have been considered for generating further income to meet costs within the migration and borders system.

          <p>A range of options were also considered in regard to the level at which the new maximas should be set. This included setting the maxima at a higher level to provide additional headroom in the event that further increases were to be pursued in future years. That option was discounted in favour of setting maximas at a level necessary only to deliver the government’s specific intention in respect of these fees in subsequent Regulations, as noted above.</p>

          <p>The preferred option is expected to be applied to businesses of all sizes, including small and micro businesses. This is in line with the principle that all employers wishing to sponsor foreign workers have the same access to the immigration system and pay the same fee per vacancy filled by migrant labour. A full Small and Micro Business Assessment can be found in the evidence base section of this IA.</p>

          <p>Under <b>Option 0 ‘Do nothing’</b>, fees maxima would remain at their current level and not be increased. This option could mean the Home Office is unable to consider reasonable increases to certain fees to support the sustainable funding of the migration and borders system, potentially requiring additional taxpayer funding to address funding gaps, or putting increased pressure on other fee routes where greater flexibility exists.</p>

          <p>Internal Home Office data indicates that 92 per cent of businesses which sponsored a migrant for a skilled worker vacancy in the year to March 2024 were non-large – 78 per cent of which were micro or small-sized, and the remaining 14 per cent being medium-sized. If this distribution holds constant in the future, around 78 per cent of sponsors impacted by a theoretical the increase in CoS fees to the proposed maxima could be micro and small businesses.  </p>

          <p>Large businesses accounted for 44 per cent of the number of skilled workers sponsored in the year ending March 2024, indicating that just under a half of a theoretical increased cost per applicant could be borne by these businesses. If this distribution remains unchanged in the future, 44 per cent of the additional cost per migrant is likely to be incurred by micro and small-sized sponsors. A further 12 per cent of additional costs could be incurred by medium businesses.</p>

As the legislation takes effect from Spring 2025, the appraisal period spans illustratively between April 2025/26 and March 2030/31.

          <p>The analysis quantifies the impact of potential increases in fees using proxies of the price elasticity for visa demand available in the academic literature.

          <p>The fiscal impact related to changes in volumes is particularly uncertain. This IA uses a marginal approach of measuring the impact of migration policy on the UK Exchequer and excludes fiscal spend and revenue components that are unlikely to vary according to the number of individuals moving to the UK. Under the marginal approach, newly arrived migrants are assumed to have little or no impact on spending on services such as pure public goods and debt interest, or on revenue streams such as capital gains tax, inheritance tax and gross operating surplus. They are assumed to have an impact on congestible public goods and taxes paid by businesses such as corporation tax and business rates. These assumptions are uncertain and the true fiscal impact of such a migrant may differ, either positively or negatively.  </p>

          <p>The over-arching strategic objective of this intervention is to support the continued sustainable funding of the migration and borders system, by ensuring that a greater proportion of the costs of the system are met by end users rather than taxpayer funding. This is reflective of the Home Office position over the last several years, and in turn works to support the government’s wider objectives in respect of immigration and nationality. For reference, £3.3bn was generated from visa and immigration income, certificate and passport fees in 2023/24 (not including income from the Immigration Health Surcharge). The full operating expenditure cost of the migration and borders system was £9.3bn in 2023/24. This includes Migration &amp; Borders Group, Customer Services (Visas and Passports), Border Force and Immigration Enforcement.</p>

Proposals were subject to consideration from relevant government departments prior to agreement and subsequent implementation through legislation.</p>

          <p>The proposed increases to maxima are necessary to implement the planned increases to fees in Spring 2025. The strategic case for those increases is to significantly increase the income generated through fees for relevant immigration and nationality applications, to increase the proportion of costs in the migration and borders system that are met by the end user, rather than taxpayer funding. This will support the department in achieving a balanced financial position in 2025/26, ensuring that sufficient funding is available to enable delivery of its objectives including in respect of border security, as well as going forward into future years.</p>

          <p>Under <b>Option 0 ‘Do nothing’</b>, fees maxima would remain at their current level and not be increased. This option would mean the Home Office is unable to consider increases to certain fees to generate sufficient additional revenue to support the continued sustainable funding of the migration and borders system. This would potentially mean that additional taxpayer funding is required instead to address funding gaps, or that there is increased pressure to increase fees on other routes where greater flexibility exists.</p>

Besides the effect on government revenue and processing costs due to changes in visa fees, the NSPV calculation includes the effect of changes in contributions to direct and indirect taxes, the effect on consumption of public services and on tuition fees paid by international students, where possible. </p>

In this IA, the resident population is considered to be UK nationals, and migrants at the point of application for naturalisation as British citizens. For the purpose of this IA, applicants for entry clearance, leave to remain (LTR) or indefinite leave to remain (ILR) products are not considered as part of the resident population.</p>

          <p>The theoretical impact of this IA covers a five-year appraisal period. As the legislation takes effect from Spring 2025, the appraisal period spans between April 2025/26 and March 2030/31.  Actual visa fees can be amended annually, so it is unreasonable to assume that this would not happen at least once over the specified appraisal period. A shorter appraisal period has been used to avoid increased uncertainty over the longer time horizon. </p>

          <p>The baseline volume of applicants for each visa product is based on Home Office internal estimates of expected applications over the appraisal period (April 2025/26 to March 2029/30). The volumes are used as the baseline against which the impact of proposed changes in visa fee maxima are assessed. The estimates of future migrant demand for visa products are estimated up to the end of the 2028/29 financial year, from which point demand is assumed to hold constant until the end of the appraisal period.</p>

          <p>An adjustment of 5.5 per cent is applied to baseline ETA estimates to account for the proportion of ETA-eligible travellers who may only transit through the UK. This reflects that, as of January 2025, these travellers will not be required to apply for an ETA where they are transiting airside (that is, through a connecting flight taken from the same airport at which they arrived in the UK). It is uncertain what proportion of transit passengers would qualify under this exemption. The analysis assumes that the 5.5 per cent estimate is the upper bound.</p>

For the sponsored skilled work route and nationality applications, the approach is consistent with previous Impact Assessments. The low volume scenario is constructed under an assumption of baseline volumes being 25 per cent lower than the central case. In a similar manner, the high volume scenario assumes that baseline volumes could be 25 per cent above the central estimate.</p>

          <p>A future increase in visa fees, enabled by the proposal to increase the fee maxima as per Option 1, may deter potential migrants from applying to enter or remain in the UK. In the theoretical example of uplifting the maximum level the Home Office can charge for visas under the routes listed in Option 1, an increase in the fee level will represent a rise in the overall cost of moving to (or remaining in) the UK, or a reduction of the associated benefit of doing so. This IA applies estimates on the responsiveness of demand for visas to the proposed change in visa fee (price elasticity of demand for visa products) to quantify impact higher fees may have on application for each visa product. </p>

          <p>Domestic businesses sponsor migrant workers to come or remain in the UK to fill employment vacancies. The price responsiveness of businesses sponsoring applicants is assumed to approximate wage elasticity of labour demand. This measure typically estimates the willingness of employers to hire workers (in essence, demand for labour) at different wage levels. Higher visa fees levied on businesses (such as the CoS) lead to an increase in the cost of sponsoring applicants. Higher CoS fees are estimated to reduce labour demand, and in turn the number of applications sponsored. </p>

          <p>Overseas individuals applying to join family members who are in the UK with a valid work visa are assumed to have the same price sensitivity as main applicants under those routes. Estimates for the wage elasticity of labour supply are applied to approximate the price sensitivity of applicants for work-related visas (such as sponsored skilled work). Wage elasticity of labour supply measures the responsiveness of an individual’s willingness to work (in essence, supply labour) to changes in wages. This is applied to expected migrant earnings (over the whole duration of the visa) to estimate any impact on migrant volumes arising from the proposed fee changes. Increases in visa fees are considered as equivalent to a reduction in the overall benefit of working in the UK (representing a pay cut) and are thus estimated to reduce labour supply and, in turn, application volumes.  </p>

          <p>The price sensitivity of nationality applicants is assumed to be similar to that of migrants supplying labour. The majority of applicants under those routes would have been in the UK for longer than five years before becoming eligible to apply for indefinite leave to remain (ILR) or nationality. It is likely that they have either been in work or have wanted to work over the qualifying time period.  The rationale for using estimates for the wage elasticity of labour supply is outlined in the dependants section above. </p>

          <p>A wage elasticity of -0.3 is applied to the central scenario. This is within the range of the most relevant UK study by Blundell, Bozio and Laroque (2011), who estimated an elasticity of -0.3 to -0.44.<authorialNote marker="16"><p> Blundell, Richard, Antoine Bozio, and Guy Laroque. 2011.

American Economic Review, 101 (3): 482-86. https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.101.3.482</p></authorialNote> It is possible that that the true elasticity would be closer to zero, as applicants would have invested time in the UK (five years) before being eligible to apply for settlement or nationality and, by applying for settlement or nationality, demonstrate they would like to remain in the UK indefinitely. The analysis uses an elasticity range of 0 to -0.6 reflecting the available evidence, uncertainty, and range of possible deterrence risks.</p>

          <p>ETAs are a new immigration product introduced after the Home Office elasticity methodology was derived but similarities to visit visas in terms of what travellers can and cannot do while in the UK renders ETA holders likely to respond to changes in ETA fees in a similar manner to visit visa holders. The analysis uses estimates of price elasticity of demand for airfares available in the academic literature as a proxy for the price elasticity of demand for a visit to the UK. The price elasticity of demand for airfares is the responsiveness of the demand for air travel to changes in the price of air travel.  </p>

        <intro>
          <p>The central NPSV scenario uses an elasticity estimate of -0.4, based primarily on Department for Transport (DfT) estimates of price elasticity of demand to changes in airfares for foreign leisure and business sectors from ETA cohorts such as members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)  and European nations.<authorialNote marker="17"><p> An internal academic literature review was used to tailor the estimates from the DfT’s UK aviation forecasts 2017: <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/781281/uk-aviation-forecasts-2017.pdf"><u>https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/781281/uk-aviation-forecasts-2017.pdf</u></a> </p></authorialNote> The low scenario uses an estimate of zero; the high scenario uses an estimate of -0.8, double the central case. The change in the price of an ETA has been applied to the typical airfare paid by travellers coming to the UK from ETA-applicable countries.</p>

          <p>These elasticities are based on the response of individual migrants to the change in the visa cost, which is a small direct response to the change in price. The impact does not take account of any second-round effects, such as the response of employers to the loss of the migrant, which could involve a range of potential responses, such as replacing the lost worker/student with another migrant, or UK national, changing working practices or changes in income over a lifetime as opposed to through the appraisal period.  </p>

          <p>Table 5 outlines the estimated effect of price elasticity of demand on visa applications under a theoretical appraised increase of fees. An uplift to the proposed maximum level is anticipated to have a relatively small impact on visa applications and visas granted. This is due to the cost of a visa product representing a small proportion of the financial incentive of individual applicants to come or remain in the UK as a worker or of the cost of travel for visitors. Similarly, the cost levied on domestic businesses wishing to sponsor international workers represents a small proportion of the total overheads of an employee. </p>

          <p>Total benefits are the sum of all direct and indirect benefits, not including transfers. Under a theoretical scenario where visa fees increase to the maxima proposed under Option 1, total benefits are estimated to amount up to £1,113.5 million, with a central estimate of £730.9 million (PV, 2024/25 prices) over the five-year appraisal period. </p>

          <p>Some of the impacts from the policy proposal represent a transfer between domestic parties where a cost incurred on one side is fully absorbed as a benefit received by another. Transfer payments may change distributions of income or wealth of the resident population, but do not give rise to direct economic costs and benefits; thus, such impacts are not counted in the NPSV of the option considered. The transfer impacts which could arise from a theoretical increase in fees from current levels to the new proposed maxima are outlined below.</p>

          <p>A potential rise in the CoS fee increases the cost domestic businesses face when sponsoring workers. The additional impact on UK organisations is calculated by multiplying the illustrative change in fee by the projected visa grants under the policy (the baseline minus the behavioural response of organisations and migrants). This additional cost represents a transfer to the Home Office laying in a range between £419.9 million and £698.1 million, with a central estimate of £559.2 million (PV, 2024/25 prices) over the five-year appraisal period.</p>

          <p>Domestic businesses sponsoring workers may incur lower costs from a future decrease in applications across sponsored work routes. This is a transfer between these parties and the government, as an increase in costs for businesses represents an increase in Home Office revenue from CoS collections. This is quantified as the product of the CoS fee and the change in granted visas. The direct benefit to organisations represents a transfer of revenue from the public sector at a magnitude of up to £1.4 million, with a central estimate of £0.5 million (PV 2024/25 prices) over the five-year appraisal period.</p>

          <p>Domestic businesses sponsoring workers under ISC-liable routes could face a reduction in costs (a benefit) from a future fall in visas, resulting from an illustrative increase in fees up to a new maxima. This is a transfer between domestic business and the government as a reduction in ISC cost to business is a fall in Home Office revenue from the ISC. This is calculated by multiplying the weighted average ISC fee by the estimated reduction in eligible visas granted. The reduction in ISC liability represents a direct transfer of revenue from the public sector to business at scale of up to £17.1 million, with a central estimate of £6.8 million (PV, 2023/24 prices) over the five-year appraisal period.</p>

Under the low scenario where application volumes are low and individuals and businesses are not price sensitive to the illustrative increases in fees, the NPSV of the policy increases to £505.5 million (PV, 2024/25 prices) over the five-year appraisal period. </p>

          <p>Under the high scenario where the decision of individuals and businesses to apply for or sponsor a visa is the most sensitive to the theoretical increases in fees and application volumes are at the high assumption, the NPSV of the policy decreases to -£292.3 million (PV, 2024/25 prices) over the five-year appraisal period.

          <p>As discussed above, transfer impacts represent a reduction in cost to domestic sponsors of migrants and the resident population (from a reduction in visa demand) and a reduction in benefit to central government through a reduction in revenue. Total transfers to the public sector are estimated to amount to £757.0 million (PV, 2024/25 prices) over the five-year appraisal period in the central case. Transfers are not included in the NPSV as the net impact of such costs and benefits is zero.</p>

          <p>Internal Home Office data indicates that 92 per cent of businesses which sponsored a migrant for a skilled worker vacancy in the year to March 2024 were non-large – around eight in ten of which were micro or small-sized, and the remaining 14 per cent being medium-sized. If this distribution holds constant in the future, around 78 per cent of sponsors impacted by a theoretical the increase in CoS fees to the proposed maxima could be micro and small businesses.  </p>

          <p>Large businesses accounted for 44 per cent of the number of skilled workers sponsored in the year ending March 2024, indicating that just under a half of a theoretical increased cost per applicant could be borne by these businesses. If this distribution remains unchanged in the future, 44 per cent of the additional cost per migrant is likely to be incurred by micro and small-sized sponsors. A further 12 per cent of additional costs could be incurred by medium businesses.</p>

          <p>Assuming that the current organisation size composition of sponsors and their CoS usage remain broadly constant over time leads to uncertainty. Ultimately, the burden of the increase in CoS fees will depend on the future willingness of businesses to sponsor workers which may be firm-specific or sector-specific.</p>

          <p>The NPSV estimates discussed above are constructed under central estimates public service provision per migrant, and fiscal contribution of migrants and varying combinations of low, central, and high assumptions of application volumes and price sensitivity. This subsection incorporates a set of sensitivity measures around each of those four assumptions against the central scenarios of the remaining three. An additional set of sensitivity analysis is included which varies volume and elasticity assumptions simultaneously against the central NPSV scenario.</p>

          <p>Sensitivity analysis has been carried out to estimate how the potential NPSV of the policy could change if baseline application volumes were lower and higher than those used in the central case. This is due to the uncertainty around the future volume of applicants who could be affected by such future increases, and that there is no current timeframe for potential increases in the fee level to the proposed fee maxima.</p>

          <p>Low and high volume scenarios are generated to account for the uncertainty of the baseline. For the sponsored skilled work route and nationality applications, the approach is consistent with previous Impact Assessments. The low volume scenario is constructed under an assumption of baseline volumes being 25 per cent lower than the central case. In a similar manner, the high volume scenario assumes that baseline volumes could be 25 per cent above the central estimate.</p>

          <p>Low and high volume scenarios for ETAs are generated based on variation in the assumed number of trips an ETA holder may undertake during the two-year ETA validity. In the low scenario, the average ETA holder is assumed to travel twice in the two-year period; in the high scenario, only one trip is undertaken per granted ETA.</p>

          <p>Low and high volume scenarios are also generated around the assumed proportion of prospective ETA holders who only transit through the UK. In the low scenario, it is assumed that 4 per cent of all ETA-eligible travellers only transit through the UK; the high scenario assumes that this proportion is 7 per cent.<authorialNote marker="23"><p> Low estimate based on a one-week snapshot of flags inputted by carriers in April 2023, high estimate based on 2018 estimates of non-EEA arrivals and the products they arrived into the UK on, including transit visas.

          <p>The level of average cost of public service provision to migrants is uncertain, so sensitivity analysis tests how various estimates of the value of average public service consumption by migrants affect the hypothetical NSPV. The difference between the low and high scenario is the inclusion of pure public goods and welfare costs in the estimate; the central case does not include pure public goods and includes half of the estimated welfare cost, as not all migrants may be eligible to receive welfare payments.  </p>

All scenarios include estimated contributions of foreign nationals to income tax, national insurance, indirect tax (such as VAT), council tax, and corporation tax. The central scenario incorporates business rates, and the high scenario adds gross operating surplus and other taxes.  </p>

Table 12 presents the theoretical BNPV over the five year appraisal period and Table 13 outlays the theoretical BNPV over the three scenarios.

          <p>The estimated decrease in visas granted following a theoretical rise in fees from the current to the proposed maxima, albeit proportionally small when compared to the wider immigration system, could be interpreted as a reduction in the demand for travel to the UK, resulting in fewer carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emissions. For simplicity, this sensitivity only considers changes in visas from applicants wishing to come to the UK (out-of-country applicants) and assumes those are equivalent to an equal number of fewer undertaken inbound journeys.</p>

          <p>Migrants play an important role in the economy. The impact of proposals that affect the number of migrants coming to, or leaving, the UK will be dependent on which migrants are in scope; their characteristics such as their age, income, health and wealth; and the nature of any proposal (for example, who may come to the UK and what they do whilst here). These factors combine to determine the size of the impact on the UK economy. The analysis assesses these impacts on the resident population and UK economy under the following broad categories: </p>

          <p>While not negligible, the expected reduction in visas granted as a result of these changes is small compared to the total number of visas granted. The macroeconomic effects as well as labour market and spill-over impacts on resident population are likely to be small. Additionally, the MAC acknowledges that the wider dynamic effects and congestion impacts are not possible to quantify, so this IA does not attempt to measure them, but it is assumed they would be small due to the small numbers involved. </p>

          <p>Economic output is a function of labour used and capital employed and can be measured impartially by GDP. Each worker is a unit of labour and contributes to the creation of economic output. If all else is equal, higher work immigration means more workers in the economy and higher economic output. Equally, a very small decrease in migration volumes caused by the increase in visa fees may have some impact in reducing economic output but this is unlikely to be significant. Whilst aggregate economic output is an important measure, when considering the economic impact of immigration, it is also important to consider GDP per capita / per person. </p>

          <p>On this measure, particularly in the short run, impacts will be small on aggregate as increased economic output are shared across a larger population. In line with MAC advice, it is important to note that although migration may affect GDP per head (by a small amount) mainly due to higher pay and employment rates of migrants compared to natives, it is the immigrants, rather than the resident population, who are the main gainers/losers. It is important to focus on the impact migration has on the GDP of residents through dynamic effects on productivity and innovation and this is dependent on the skill level of the migrants.</p>

          <p>Internal Home Office analysis has not found evidence of a significant relationship between small increases in fees and visa demand. Absence of evidence does not necessarily imply there is no relationship and setting the fees at the proposed maximum levels on certain routes under Option 1 may represent a larger rise in the price of these visas than historic changes. The estimates of a potential negative effect on visa demand are presented; however, these estimates may overstate the actual impact.  </p>

          <p>The fiscal impact related to changes in volumes is particularly uncertain. This IA uses a marginal approach of measuring the impact of migration policy on the UK Exchequer and excludes fiscal spend and revenue components that are unlikely to vary according to the number of individuals moving to the UK. Under the marginal approach, newly arrived migrants are assumed to have little or no impact on spending on services such as pure public goods and debt interest, or on revenue streams such as capital gains tax, inheritance tax and gross operating surplus. They are assumed to have an impact on congestible public goods and taxes paid by businesses such as corporation tax and business rates. These assumptions are uncertain and the true fiscal impact of such a migrant may differ, either positively or negatively.  </p>

                  <p class="ia-table-text">The Secretary of State for the Home Department (Home Secretary)’s public sector equality duty has been considered in the course of developing the changes set out in this amendment to the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order 2016. As this instrument only amends the maximum amount that can be charged, and not the fee level itself, the Home Office consider that there will be no impacts on individuals with protected characteristics as a result of this amendment. Any changes to actual fees charged (which would need to be made through a subsequent amendment to the Immigration and Nationality (Fee) Regulations 2018) will be accompanied by a further statement in respect of the Home Secretary’s Public Sector Equality Duty.</p>
