                <p class="ia-table-text"><b>What is the problem under consideration? Why is government action or intervention necessary?</b></p>
                <p class="ia-table-text"><i>Substantial acceleration in the rate of annual heat pump deployment is central to decarbonising heating and achieving net zero, since heat in buildings accounts for around 22% of annual UK greenhouse gas emissions. The deployment of electric heat pumps is also an integral part of measures to support greater energy independence and reduce dependence on imported oil and gas, since more than 40% of annual UK gas consumption is for heat in buildings.</i></p>
                <p class="ia-table-text"><i>Along with measures such as insulation to improve the fabric efficiency of buildings, an important part of reducing energy demand is switching to more efficient heating appliances. As electric heat pumps can produce several units of heat for every unit of energy consumed, replacing a boiler with a heat pump is often the most impactful measure for reducing a building’s energy demand.</i></p>
                <p class="ia-table-text"><i>To enable this level of deployment, the heat pump market and supply chains need to continue to develop substantially in order to provide a wide range of attractive choices for consumers, with compelling and simple consumer journeys, supported by a wide base of skilled advisors and installers. Heat pumps are currently largely unable to compete on lifetime cost with established fossil fuel and less efficient heating options, such as natural gas and oil boilers. This is partly due to the emerging nature of low-carbon heating, which means that it does not benefit from economies of scale or from mature supply chains to the same degree as conventional technologies. Additionally, the full societal costs of fossil fuel combustion are not reflected in their market prices, including for example impacts on health and climate change. </i></p>
                <p class="ia-table-text"><i>In the absence of an effective policy framework, including regulatory policies such as the policy assessed here, for which powers have been granted in the Energy Act 2023, the heat pump market would not be expected to grow at the targeted rate. This would result in lower greenhouse gas emissions reductions from buildings than targeted in near-term carbon budgets. Without policies to develop the market and supply chain for heat pumps over the coming years to a sufficient capacity such as the policy assessed here, cost-effectively implementing further policy action necessary for reaching net zero emissions in the longer term may be at risk.</i></p>
                <p class="ia-table-text"><b>What are the policy objectives of the action or intervention and the intended effects?</b></p>
                <p class="ia-table-text"><i>The Clean Heat Market Mechanism (CHMM), as established by the Clean Heat Market Mechanism Regulations 2024, introduces a market obligation which establishes a platform for an industry-led transformation of the heating appliance market. As detailed in three consultations –  in October 2021, March 2023 and March 2024 – the Clean Heat Market Mechanism creates a market incentive to grow the numbers of low-carbon heating appliances installed</i></p>

          <p>The government has an ambitious package of policy measures to help the United Kingdom enhance its energy security, become less dependent on global gas markets, and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One important way to enhance UK energy security and accelerate decarbonisation is to reduce the energy used in buildings. In addition to measures such as insulation to improve the fabric efficiency of buildings, an important part of reducing energy demand is switching to more efficient heating appliances. Electric heat pumps have a crucial role to play in this as they can produce several units of heat for every unit of energy consumed, meaning that replacing a boiler with a heat pump is often the most impactful measure for reducing a building’s energy demand. As the UK electricity generation mix continues to reduce in carbon intensity, heating using electric heat pumps will also continue to produce fewer greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

          <p>As past consultations on the Clean Heat Market Mechanism set out, it is important that the heat pump market is supported to develop at pace over the coming years in order to make heat pumps a mainstream consumer solution alongside gas boilers, approximately 1.6 million of which are currently installed each year. Substantial growth in heat pump deployment, including in new-build properties, is strategically important for any energy transition pathway to net zero.</p>

          <p>The Scheme Regulations, which this impact assessment accompanies, establish the target levels for the first year of the scheme; amending legislation will be required to establish any changes to the targets for years 2 to 4 of the scheme and adjust any other scheme parameters as may be necessary. If further legislation were not to be brought forward as planned, the Scheme Regulations as they are being laid would maintain the target level at the Year 1 level. Targets for Years 2-4 (and potentially beyond) will ultimately be set by the government, considering a range of factors including the feasible growth rate of the heat pump supply chain, the contribution of wider policy action to heat pump deployment, and the pace of market development necessary to meet strategic aims related to energy efficiency and emissions reductions. This impact assessment therefore assesses the impact of the Regulations being introduced, i.e. with the target set at 6% for year 1 of the scheme and without subsequent further target increases across the lifetime of the scheme.</p>

          <p>The Regulations establish that a heat pump manufacturer will earn a credit (“a certificate”) for the installation of a qualifying domestic-scale hydronic heat pump notified via an appropriate certification scheme such as the Microgeneration Certification Scheme. To provide flexibility in how the obligation can be met, these credits are tradable. Providing further optionality in how the obligation may be met, certain installations of hybrid heat pump systems that involve both a heat pump and a fossil fuel boiler element also qualify, receiving 0.5 heat pump credits.</p>

          <p>A range of other policies, such as the Boiler Upgrade Scheme, Social Housing Decarbonisation Fund and Energy Company Obligation, contribute to achieving the overall ambition for heat pump market growth. The Clean Heat Market Mechanism is designed to operate complementarily with this wider policy framework, with it both helping to shore up and maximise cost-effective delivery from other policies while the support to the heat pump sector from other policies helps ensure that the scheme’s targets are achievable and without disproportionate costs.</p>

          <p>In 2008, Parliament passed the Climate Change Act 2008 (‘the Act’) which sets a legally binding goal for reducing UK greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2050. The original act, passed in 2008, committed the UK to an 80% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, compared to 1990 levels. In 2019, <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2019/1056/contents/made"><u>the Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment) Order 2019</u></a> was passed which increased the UK’s commitment to reduce emissions by at least 100% below 1990 levels (i.e. Net Zero GHG emissions). </p>

          <p>The Act also requires the UK government to set ‘carbon budgets’, which are legally binding targets for UK emissions over five-year periods. The first five carbon budgets, running up to 2032, were set to achieve progress towards the previously set 80% reduction target by 2050. The Sixth Carbon Budget, set in June 2021, put into law a target to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to 965MtCO2e between 2033-2037 – meaning emissions will be approximately 77% lower (including international aviation and shipping) in 2035 than in 1990. </p>

          <p>To meet our carbon budgets, and to reach net zero emissions by 2050, the UK must decarbonise the vast majority of heat in buildings and most industrial processes. In 2022, the buildings sector was responsible for 22% of total UK net GHG emissions. This is a critical decade for action on the decarbonisation of heat and upgrading the energy efficiency of homes and other buildings. </p>

          <p>There are several possible pathways to full decarbonisation of heat by 2050 with a range of low-carbon technologies and systems that may have an important role to play, including a potential role for hydrogen. Heat pumps and heat networks are established technologies that will be the primary means for decarbonising heating over the next decade and play a key role in all 2050 scenarios.</p>

          <p>As consultations on the Clean Heat Market Mechanism set out, it is important that the heat pump market is supported to develop at pace over the coming years to make heat pumps a mainstream consumer solution alongside gas boilers. If widespread use of low-carbon gas heating, e.g. hydrogen, is ruled out as a viable strategic pathway for 2050, electrified heating based predominantly on heat pumps is likely to be the most widespread solution. This would require continued market growth to over one million annual heat pump installations by the early-2030s. </p>

NB MCS data here may not represent the full number of heat pump retrofits in 2023, but is expected to represent the majority.</p></authorialNote>, in comparison to around 1.6 million fossil fuel boiler installations (of which ~110,000 in new-build properties).<authorialNote marker="2"><p>3BSRIA <i>UK </i><i>D</i><i>omestic Boilers</i> (2024)</p></authorialNote> Heat pumps are currently largely unable to compete on lifetime cost with established fossil fuel-based and less energy-efficient heating options, such as natural gas and oil boilers. This is partly due to the emerging nature of low-carbon heating, which means that it does not benefit from economies of scale or from mature supply chains to the same degree as conventional technologies.</p>

        <content>
          <p>A key element of the rationale for this intervention is the market failure with respect to the uncaptured negative externalities of conventional heating technologies, which renders their market price too low compared to the price of heat pumps. The full societal costs of heating based on fossil fuel combustion should consider the impacts on health (related to the air quality impacts) and the emission of greenhouse gases, leading to climate change. The need to deliver advancements in the decarbonisation of heating requires more urgent government action to correct the effects of this market failure within the UK heating system.</p>

          <p>Likewise, the relative positive effect of heat pump deployment on air quality and emissions, and thus their lower societal cost, is not captured in their price. This is likely to result in under-investment in this technology, due to a lower expected payoff than would be provided by a market price reflecting the full range of social and private costs and benefits.</p>

          <p>As outlined in the 2023 Clean Heat Market Mechanism consultation document, there is already a set of existing and planned policies to stimulate heat pump deployment, including heat pump subsidies (e.g. the Boiler Upgrade Scheme) and building regulations (e.g. the proposed Future Homes Standard). However, this policy framework does not provide sufficient incentive and strategic confidence to relevant market actors to develop and promote products, offerings, and services that expand the consumer appeal and therefore uptake of heat pumps in retrofit settings. Without further intervention the heat pump market is unlikely to achieve the growth needed to establish the heat pump market quickly enough to meet our decarbonisation goals.</p>

Future policies within this broader framework are currently at different stages of development. The principal overall policy alternative would therefore be to pursue either the same or further subsidy-based measures (e.g., heat pump grants) and/or the same or further building-owner regulatory measures alone on the demand side without an accompanying market obligation. </p>

          <p>Meeting the heat pump deployment ambition solely through subsidy-based measures would reduce the confidence of achieving the targeted deployment outcome, relative to our preferred option; this is because the risk would remain that insufficient consumer demand and grant uptake would be seen, likely because other non-cost barriers and inertia to uptake might not have been addressed. This option would also have lower incentives, relative to the preferred option, for industry to achieve downward pressure, through competitive market efficiencies, on the overall social cost. Over time, a large subsidy regime would risk locking in inefficiencies and higher prices. Further, this approach carries the usual risks associated with setting the correct subsidy level: grants too low would not generate the demand needed to meet the deployment ambition, while grants too high would over-compensate households reducing the benefit per pound of public spend. Therefore, this alternative is less likely to reach the policy goals and would likely lead to higher overall social costs.</p>

          <p>The same level of heat pump deployment could be achieved through regulatory measures alone, such as fossil fuel appliance installation bans for specific household segments. However, in this scenario there would be reduced incentives for an industry-led transformation of the market through competition, since the policy would provide industry with an obligated consumer base, potentially locking in expectations around current costs and prices. Further, this option would likely have significant negative distributional impacts with the targeted households forced to bear the full cost of heat decarbonisation. Therefore, this alternative is less likely to reach the policy goals and would lead to higher overall social costs or undermine the government’s goal of decarbonising the energy system in a fair and affordable way for all energy users.</p>

          <p>Finally, a combination of grants and installation bans would help to tackle only one of the market barriers (the higher installation cost of heat pumps compared to fossil fuel alternatives) but it would not provide any incentive for the market to experiment with efforts to address the other barriers preventing consumers from installing heat pumps. Therefore, under this option, deployment might meet the necessary rates, but it could do so for a higher cost to consumers and government, compared to our preferred option.</p>

          <p>Qualifying individual standalone heat pump installations will generate a single scheme credit for the manufacturer. Installations of qualifying hybrid heat pumps, systems that involve both a heat pump and a fossil fuel boiler element, will receive 0.5 heat pump credits. The lower weighting for hybrid heat pump installations compared with standalone heat pumps is intended to reflect: (1) the lower carbon reduction potential of these systems (given their reliance on fossil fuels); and (2) the lower energy demand reduction potential given their lower overall system efficiency, when compared to standalone heat pumps.</p>

          <p>In order to provide flexibility in how the obligation can be met, the scheme’s credits are tradable. Obligated parties are therefore able to meet their credit obligation, in part or in whole, through acquiring credits from other heat pump manufacturers. As there are many routes to compliance, in this IA we have only modelled the impact of the heat pump deployment, regardless of the approach obligated parties decide to take to comply with the regulation. In principle, a secondary market will not affect the total number of heat pumps installed so we have assumed it to have no impact on the overall social net present value. However, an illustrative analysis of the possible distributional impact to businesses of such a secondary market is presented in the Impact on Business section.</p>

          <p>Where obligated parties fail to meet their credit obligation, and where this shortfall exceeds the obligation that can be carried over into the subsequent year under the target carry-forward rules above, they will be required to make a payment in lieu of the remaining shortfall, at a rate of £500 per missing heat pump credit. This provides an incentive for companies to meet their targets through the sale and installation of heat pumps, or through the acquisition of heat pump credits, thereby ensuring the incentives align with the aim of the CHMM to support an expansion of the UK heat pump market. For these reasons, in the central scenario of this IA we have assumed full compliance of obligated parties. The Impact on Business section discusses the possible impact of payments-in-lieu on businesses.</p>

          <p>This section outlines the evidence base on which impacts of the scheme have been modelled and the overall analytical approach undertaken to assess the illustrative costs and benefits of the Clean Heat Market Mechanism. The impact assessment presents the evidence of the impacts of the proposals for households, the business sector and wider society. It follows the principle of the Green Book guidance in identifying the key direct costs and benefits for these groups. The changes are compared with a counterfactual scenario and then monetised using standard Green Book appraisal values. Net present values are derived by comparing the aggregate costs and benefits which are discounted by the social discount rate.</p>

          <p>As described above, this impact assessment reflects the legislation as it will be introduced –manufacturers of fossil fuel heating appliances will need to hold low-carbon heat pump credits corresponding to 6% of their relevant boiler sales for each year of the policy, FY 2025/26 to FY 2028/29. If future proposals and/or legislation are brought forward to adjust targets beyond the first year of the scheme, this will be accompanied by a consultation and updated Impact Assessment. </p>

          <p>A cost-benefit approach is limited in assessing non-marginal change, such as the creation of markets and accelerated innovation, which are among the objectives of the proposal.  As such, the impact assessment is supplemented by a qualitative discussion of non-monetised costs and benefits which sets out the relevant evidence to wider strategic considerations.  Therefore, the calculated SNPVs are not intended to be viewed in isolation but should be assessed in combination with the strategic considerations. </p>

Any certified low-carbon heating retrofit installations performed in the relevant scheme year (e.g. FY 25/26) will count towards the obligation target set for that year. </p>

          <p>We expect the Clean Heat Market Mechanism to support or enable part of this deployment, for instance through contributing to market conditions in which more building-owners take decarbonisation action in response to building regulations earlier than in a counterfactual scenario, but it is difficult to produce a quantified estimate of this contribution. For simplicity, in the counterfactual scenario of this IA we have assumed that other policies would maintain the same level of low-carbon heating appliance deployment as in the absence of the CHMM. Therefore, in the policy scenario we have estimated only the impact of the additional deployment not primarily driven by (and therefore attributed to) other policies. This has been calculated as the difference between the target and the deployment that is already assumed will take place because of other policies (the counterfactual).  </p>

          <p>This approach allows us to avoid any double counting of the impact of other policies. However, as we expect the market-based mechanism to be a partial enabler of the other policies, which tend to have a positive SNPV, the SNPV presented in this IA is likely to be a lower bound to the SNPV associated with the total retrofit deployment within heat pump targets.  </p>

          <p>The ‘Clean Heat Market Mechanism additional deployment’ depends on the deployment levels of other policies. Estimating this level of deployment is challenging and subject to a high degree of uncertainty at this stage, especially since the installation of heat pumps is only one of the possible outcomes for certain policies in consideration. In this IA we have assumed that heat pump installations driven primarily by other policies will contribute to 61,000 credits in 2025/26. With the CHMM target for 2025/26 being 77,000, this would attribute the deployment of a further 16,000 HPs to the CHMM. </p>

Once the Spending Review is complete, and the Government has published further detail on its overall 'Warm Homes Plan', we will publish a further impact assessment focused on proposals for future CHMM scheme years</p>

          <p>This deployment is illustrative and assumes that BUS historical data represents the best indicator of future deployment and is maintained even as deployment levels grow. We have assumed that hybrid heat pump installations will constitute 20% of the additional on-gas-grid deployment from the market mechanism. </p>

          <p>While this cross-section of BUS installations by technology type forms our starting point, we have also imposed limits in the model which prevent retrofits for any incumbent technology type exceeding their annual turnover rate, as heat pump installations increase. Therefore, the mix of deployment can adjust over time with on grid retrofit often accounting for a larger share of the total by the end of the scheme. In this IA, we assume installations take place in the average household within each segment. We expect most of the heat pump deployment to take place in domestic buildings, but in practice it is possible that some installations may be in small non-domestic buildings. Given the thermal capacity limit for heat pump installations within the policy scope, we assume these non-domestic buildings have the same characteristics as domestic properties. Consequently, the proportion of non-domestic installations does not affect the quantifiable policy costs and benefits. </p>

          <p>Current evidence suggests that heat pumps are technically suitable for most buildings. DESNZ modelling suggests around 90% have sufficient energy efficiency and internal electrical connection capacity to accommodate a low temperature heat pump system. Other factors, such as space constraints, might reduce the proportion of buildings suitable for heat pumps in practice; however, it is unlikely that the obligated parties will target segments of the building stock where extensive new energy efficiency (e.g., insulation) measures are needed or where other factors could make the installation challenging. Therefore, in this IA we have not included the cost of any energy efficiency measures. We do however include the cost of in-home changes which we expect to be required in most buildings, such as hot water storage and larger radiators.</p>

          <p>We expect some households to deploy energy efficiency measures, which will reduce their heat demand, between now and the obligation period. However, low-carbon heating installations under the Clean Heat Market Mechanism will be on a voluntary basis so it is difficult to accurately predict the possible level of heat demand reduction in households benefitting from the mechanism. Therefore, as a modelling assumption in this IA we have assumed no impact on households’ heat demand because of energy efficiency improvements. This assumption carries the risk of overestimating both costs and benefits of the policy: a lower heat demand would lead to reduced heat pump installation costs and reduced carbon savings potential. Heat demand is assumed to change slightly from today’s level to account for long-term climate and energy trends.</p>

          <p>Table 9 summarises the key social benefits and costs of the policy for a central scenario compared to the do-nothing counterfactual scenario. The Social Net Present Value (SNPV) represents the difference between these social costs and benefits i.e. the overall monetary value of the policy option relative to the do-nothing counterfactual. In the case of the CHMM, the SNPV represents the monetary value of the additional heat pump installations that are attributable to the policy option. </p>

          <p>The Capex value is negative as the cost of installing a heat pump is greater than that of common counterfactual technologies such as gas and oil boilers. The market-based and market-wide nature of the policy should help to keep overall costs as low as possible, with obligated parties competing to develop the heat pump market in the most efficient ways possible. A Eunomia report commissioned by DESNZ in 2022 suggests that deployment and R&amp;D could bring down the total capital cost of heat pumps, including both appliance and installations costs, by around 20% in a scenario where deployment reaches 600,000 installations per year. Therefore, we have assumed that this level of cost reduction is achieved by 2028, with a linear reduction from 2024 prices. In practice, several market participants believe that higher cost reductions can be achieved significantly faster.</p>

          <p>Households that switch from gas boilers to heat pumps experience higher LRVC, despite the fact that heat pumps use less energy than counterfactual technologies (such as gas and oil boilers) to heat homes, due to the higher relative price of electricity. However, this is partly offset by homes, reliant on fossil fuel heating fuels, off the gas grid, where prices are more favourable to heat pumps. Overall, the LRVC impacts are a net cost. Maintenance costs are assumed to be the same in the policy scenarios and the counterfactual.</p>

          <p>The efficiency of a low-carbon heating system has an impact on fuel consumption and running costs.  This is expected to vary with weather conditions, the nature of the building stock, and the level of innovation. The low and high end of the assumption range is tested here (S3). This sensitivity test is also intended to reflect uncertainty with regards to future improvements of clean heat system performance.  </p>

          <p>A Eunomia report commissioned by DESNZ in 2022 shows that deployment and R&amp;D could bring down the total capital cost of heat pumps, including both appliance and installations costs, by around 20% in a mass market scenario. In the central scenario we assumed this reduction to take place by 2028, with a linear reduction trajectory from 2024 prices. In the lower/upper bounds of this sensitivity analysis (S3), we explore scenarios with linear cost reduction trajectories leading to 10%/50% reductions by 2030.</p>

        <intro>
          <p>Compared to standalone heat pumps, hybrids imply lower emissions savings as fossil fuels are used to meet part of the heat demand. The level of emissions savings for each fossil fuel hybrid installation is proportionate to the level of heat demand met by the heat pump component. In the central scenario we have assumed that 20% of the heat pumps installed in households on the gas grid are hybrids; in this sensitivity (S5), we explore the impact of a higher (50%) and lower (0%) proportion. Because of the planned credit weighting (0.5 credits for a hybrid installation vs. 1 credit for a standalone heat pump), varying the proportion of hybrid deployment has an impact on the total number of heat pumps (hybrid and standalone) deployed. </p>

            <p><b>Risk of non-compliance</b>. HMT Green Book guidance requires that central scenarios assume compliance with regulation. However, should obligated parties decide to make payment in lieu of heat pump sales, this will reduce the growth of the heat pump market and corresponding benefits. The rate of the payment in lieu has been set to mitigate this risk. This is discussed further in the impacts on business section below. </p>

          <p>As heat pump uptake under this scheme is on a voluntary basis, we do not expect any impact on fuel poverty. Households switching from direct electric heating to heat pumps will see a significant reduction in their energy demand because of the higher efficiency of heat pumps, with a beneficial impact on energy bills. Reducing the running costs of heat pumps, including relative to fossil fuel boilers, is an aim of wider government policy. The government is keen to ensure that consumers can make greener choices  and is considering the best and most efficient way to bring down running costs of low-carbon alternatives such as heat pumps. </p>

          <p>Equalities Impact Assessments have been conducted throughout the scheme’s development; and a summary is provided here. Our assessment informed by stakeholder responses to both the October 2021 and March 2023 consultations – is that the implementation of the Clean Heat Market Mechanism will not disadvantage or have disproportionately negative direct impacts on any groups sharing protected characteristics. The main intended outcomes of the policy - carbon emissions reductions and strategic alignment to net zero objectives - are non-excludable public goods and therefore expected to benefit the majority of the population without distributional impacts for specific groups. </p>

          <p>The cost of a low carbon heating system may remain a barrier to those on lower incomes, which may limit the direct benefits of the policy for this group. While lower household income is not itself a protected characteristic, it is often correlated with several protected characteristics, such as certain race and disability groups.  It is also therefore possible the policy will have higher indirect impacts for certain such groups with respect to the balance of near-term costs and benefits. However, we believe that there is strong justification for proceeding with the policy despite this potential disparity in the timing of the indirect accrual of costs and benefits to protected groups, and that it is proportionate to proceed. Without policies such as this to drive market scale and promote long-term cost reduction, costs and prices of low-carbon heating are less likely to reduce over time, meaning that the cost of switching to low-carbon heating will remain prohibitive for more households for longer.</p>

          <p>With respect to the second and third arms of the Equality Duty, while our assessment is that the policy will not have significant immediate impacts on either advancing equality of opportunity or fostering better relations between groups that share protected characteristics and those that do not, we believe that contributing to decreasing the cost of home decarbonisation and of energy-efficient appliances such as heat pumps through helping scale these markets and supply chains may have a minor role in reducing a current income- and/or wealth-based disparity of access to these technologies. This present disparity may disproportionately affect those in certain groups that share protected characteristics. As wider incentives start to further encourage decarbonisation, addressing this disparity, through policies such as this and others, will become increasingly important, in order to maintain equality of opportunity and preserves social cohesion and good relations between groups.</p>

The supply chain will also be affected by the obligation, as third parties might be involved in delivering the installations to meet the targets.

          <p>Fossil fuel heating appliance manufacturing is a relatively concentrated market sector, with four companies responsible for around 91% of annual gas boiler sales (ca. 1.5m per year), and five companies responsible for around a further ~7% of sales. The four largest companies, and a number of the second-tier companies, are all multi-technology corporations producing and selling a range of appliances including heat pumps in several countries. In the oil boiler sector, four companies share around 93% of annual sales (around 55,000 per year), and another two companies a further 3%<authorialNote marker="10"><p> BSRIA (2024), ‘Domestic Boilers Market Analysis 2023’ </p></authorialNote>.

          <p>Companies with boiler sales less than 20,000 relevant gas boilers and 1,000 relevant oil boilers, corresponding to roughly 1% of the UK market are exempt. Companies that meet the criteria of the small companies regime in the Companies Act 2006 are also not in scope of the obligation. These minimum thresholds and the exclusion of small companies limit the number of obligated companies and limit the costs to smaller firms or those with only limited activities in the UK. It also ensures that the administrative complexity and costs of administering the obligation are kept proportionate.</p>

          <p>In delivering their obligation, businesses will incur familiarisation and administrative costs. These will vary by business - depending on factors such as their setup, size and decisions on how to comply with the obligation - but are likely to include items such as the cost of running IT databases, staff time, data verification and reporting to the scheme administrator. They may also include indirect costs, such as human resources and legal costs.</p>

          <p>The cost to businesses of meeting their CHMM obligations are difficult to assess with confidence. At the lower end of the range, they could amount only to the familiarisation and administrative costs estimated in the section above. However, the difference in cost between heat pump and fossil fuel systems and the presence of market barriers and failures means that there are scenarios where businesses may need to subsidise heat pumps to induce households to install them. For each installation, the size of such subsidy required would be affected by several factors:</p>

          <p>The possibility to trade credits means that the costs faced by different obligated parties could vary significantly, depending on whether they decide to meet their credit obligation, in part or in whole, through acquiring credits from other heat pump manufacturers. Some of the costs that obligated parties will face are transfers between businesses; others will be offset by direct benefits to business. In line with Better Regulation Executive guidance, we have excluded these costs from the total. </p>

          <p>Obligated parties have the option to make a ‘payment in lieu’ instead of selling a heat pump at a cost of £500. If the costs of subsidising heat pumps to achieve the necessary sales is too high, they may prefer to make these payments. We can therefore consider the maximum cost to business as the total number of heat pump sales attributed to the CHMM multiplied by this £500 payment amount, plus the familiarisation and admin costs described above. These costs are estimated in table 12 below. </p>

          <p>Should boiler manufacturing businesses decide to meet the obligation by selling heat pumps themselves, they may need to subsidise these heat pumps to encourage households to install them. This subsidy (delivery cost), if present, would be a direct cost to business. We estimate that this cost to business is between our minimum and maximum estimates described above. All the additional costs associated with manufacturing, marketing and installing the heat pumps over and above the equivalents for boilers should be considered direct costs associated with the scheme; however, they will be (fully or partly) offset by the direct revenues generated from the heat pump sales. This means that the only true cost to business would be the possible extra subsidy they might need to offer to persuade some households to install heat pumps.</p>

          <p>Within our analysis there is an assumption that consumers’ willingess to contribute towards the cost of their heat pump installation will reduce the cost for obligated parties by £2500 per installation on average. This is an illustrative estimate and is based in part on evidence from the Boiler Upgrade Scheme to date, which suggests that applicants are willing to contribute, on average, around £8000 for the total cost of the heat pump (and therefore over £5000 on top of the cost of an average boiler). However, these applicants to the scheme to date may be considered early adopters with a particular interest in decarbonisation. In future years, one might expect the average willingness to pay to decrease as deployment increases; on the other hand, as the market develops, it is likely there will be increased consumer awareness as well as new financing arrangements that could combine to make it easier to find a greater number of willing-and-able-to-pay heat pump consumers.</p>

Given our assumptions regarding support from other heat pump policies and current potential contributions from consumers, under Option 1, in our central scenario, the subsidy cost to business would be negligible. However, there is significant uncertainty around this analysis. For caution, under Option 1 we use the maximum possible average annual cost (£8m) for our overall cost to business calculation. </p>

          <p>Actual cost to business may be lower than this maximum estimate: more ambitious heat pump cost reductions, in line with the Government’s ambition for parity of lifetime costs by 2030, the increased appeal of heat pumps to consumers as the market grows, and the impact on the market of complementary wider policy would decrease the cost significantly. Businesses may choose to pass through costs to other parts of the business and/or the prices of other products in their portfolio, although alternative approaches to funding market expansion may be available. These potential cost reductions could increase the likelihood of businesses meeting the obligation to install heat pumps instead of making a payment in lieu.  We will monitor and assess market impacts of the scheme as part of our approach to monitoring and evaluation. Table 14 below summarises the key costs to business.</p>

          <p>The policy should have a significant positive impact for installers and maintenance engineers of the low-carbon heating appliances in scope, many of which are small or micro enterprises, through increased business activity. There are currently over 1,700 businesses in the UK certified with the Microgeneration Certification Scheme (MCS) to install heat pumps, estimated to employ over 7,000 installers. The total number of trained heat pump installers is, however, likely to be greater than this, as MCS Certification is only required for installations receiving Government grant funding. The increased level of deployment driven by the policy should increase the revenues of these businesses; furthermore, by providing certainty in the growth of the heat pump market, the policy should encourage businesses to invest in installer training, with a positive impact on the supply chain. To further support this, Government announced a £5m Heat Training Grant to support trainees in England taking training relevant to heat pumps and heat networks. This is expected to support 10,000 training opportunities up to 2025, including at least 6,000 for heat pumps. </p>

          <p>Any decline in future fossil fuel boiler sales should be matched by an increase in heat pump sales, and we expect this to lead to an overall increase in work for the heating workforce. Heating engineers who choose not to diversify into the low-carbon market could see a potential negative impact, but we expect this impact to be small. We expect the negative impact to be small. Recent Government research found that around three quarters of heating and cooling installers could either install heat pumps already or are open to being persuaded to train to install heat pumps in the long term<authorialNote marker="14"><p> BEIS (2023), Heating and cooling installer study,</p><p><a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/heating-and-cooling-installer-study"><u>https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/heating-and-cooling-installer-study</u></a></p></authorialNote>. We expect the majority of heat pump installers in 2028 to be current heating engineers who train to install heat pumps alongside other heating technologies; those not willing to retrain are likely to be planning to retire within the timescales of the CHMM and therefore will not be negatively impacted. Overall, Government expects the installer workforce to expand, creating new opportunities for apprentices. A new three-year Low Carbon Heating Technician apprenticeship launched in September 2023, and the existing Plumbing &amp; Domestic Heating Technician apprenticeship is being revised to ensure that all heating apprentices learn the core skills needed for low-carbon heating.</p>

          <p>Regarding impacts on businesses more broadly, i.e., outside the heating market and wider supply chain, while direct impacts are likely to be limited, it is likely that over time there will be an indirect benefit from reduced costs of low-carbon heating appliances and their installation, reducing the costs of switching to appliances that consume less energy and of compliance with present and future minimum energy efficiency standards and building regulations. Being indirect, such benefits don’t feature in the EANDCB assessment calculation for the policy.</p>

          <p>We do not assess that the policy will lead to significant negative impacts on competition in terms of range of suppliers in the market, suppliers’ ability to compete, suppliers’ incentives to compete vigorously, or the choice and information available to consumers. Rather, our assessment is that the fossil fuel appliance market will remain competitive and that the low-carbon heating appliance market is likely to become larger, with more actors and more pressure to compete vigorously on costs and other differentiators, with benefits for consumers. The ability to trade in credits on the secondary market, target carry-forward and <i>de minimis</i> conditions are also expected to limit the risk of a negative impact on competition.</p>

          <p>The policy applies equally to the manufacturers of fossil fuel heating appliances imported to the UK market as to those manufactured in the UK, thereby ensuring that competition and trade are not distorted in favour of overseas competitors. The policy could in principle deter new entry of boiler manufacturers to the UK market. In practice, however, the UK boiler market is highly mature and significant new entrants in the absence of this policy, while not impossible, would perhaps therefore be unlikely.</p>

          <p>By providing a market signal of a firm and fast-growing UK heat pump market, the policy is likely to increase the attractiveness of the UK market to international actors in the heat pump market, either to begin or expand import of their products or services and/or to consider investing in establishing a UK presence, potentially including manufacturing. To support this, the government launched a £30 million Heat Pump Investment Accelerator Competition (HPIAC) in 2023. The Competition awards grant funding for eligible capital costs relating to the construction of new factories, or the expansion or retooling of existing factories, to produce heat pumps or their components. Attributing any increase in inward investment in the UK heat pump market solely to the Clean Heat Market Mechanism, rather than to a combination of policy and market drivers, would though be very difficult.</p>

          <p>Micro businesses do not directly incur costs as a result of the scheme regulations. The regulations establish <i>de minimis</i> threshold exclusions from the policy scope: manufacturers of fossil fuel appliances with less than 20,000 relevant gas boiler sales or less than 1,000 relevant oil boiler sales, currently equivalent to a little over a 1% market share in each case, are not in scope of the obligation to meet heat pump targets with respect to those appliances. Companies that meet the criteria of the small companies regime under the Companies Act 2006<authorialNote marker="15"><p> Companies Act (2006), <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/part/15/chapter/1/crossheading/companies-subject-to-the-small-companies-regime"><u>https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2006/46/part/15/chapter/1/crossheading/companies-subject-to-the-small-companies-regime</u></a></p><p /></authorialNote> are also not in scope of the obligation.

          <p>The regulations establish that the administration of the CHMM will be based on corporate groups: related parties, business units, or brands within the same corporate group are treated as one ‘appliance manufacturer’ entity for the purposes of determining targets under the scheme and awarding heat pump credits. The obligation applies to all manufacturers of relevant fossil fuel appliances sold for installation in the UK, who are not excluded as per above, regardless of whether the manufacturing takes place in the UK or of whether the company has a UK corporate presence. This approach aims to ensure the obligation is applied fairly and does not have a disproportionate impact on UK manufacturers relative to non-UK manufacturers. Therefore, businesses with few or zero UK employees whose levels of UK sales are above the <i>de minimis</i> threshold will be considered in scope of the obligation. These businesses may class as small businesses in terms of numbers of UK employees (i.e. fewer than 49), but are generally larger entities in global terms, with higher staff numbers in their headquarter and/or manufacturing locations.</p>

          <p>It is possible that smaller businesses in scope of the obligation – for instance those with just over 1% of market share (around five in total at present) – may face proportionately higher costs compared to larger businesses in scope. For instance, the opportunity costs of upfront familiarisation with requirements and ongoing administration/reporting may be higher for a firm without dedicated compliance or regulatory affairs staff. However, it should be noted that any businesses in scope have the option of purchasing credits from other heat pump manufacturers, reducing transition and other fixed costs for such firms.</p>

          <p>Outside of parties in scope of the obligation, a substantial number of existing, diversifying or new micro and small businesses engaged in the installation of low-carbon heating are likely to benefit indirectly from the policy’s increase in business in this area. Data from the Heat Pump Association indicates that the large majority of existing installers are small or micro businesses<authorialNote marker="16"><p> Heat Pump Association (2019), Installer survey results,</p><p> <a href="https://www.heatpumps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Installer-Skills-Survey-Summary.pdf"><u>https://www.heatpumps.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Installer-Skills-Survey-Summary.pdf</u></a> </p></authorialNote>. Since a key objective of the Clean Heat Market Mechanism is to build the supply chain, we expect the scheme to maintain existing small or micro low carbon heat businesses and create opportunities for growth and new businesses in this segment to emerge.

          <p>The benefits of a programme evaluation are that it is better placed to assess shared impacts where individual policy evaluations struggle to attribute impact to a particular scheme in a busy policy environment where multiple mechanisms are attempting to stimulate the same results. However, this comes at the expense of a greater volume of policy specific evidence, particularly in the process evaluation, which is better served by individual policy evaluations.</p>

          <p>Any design would see the evaluation providing an assessment of whether the CHMM realised it’s intended impacts (benefits and wider impacts), drawing on secondary monitoring data and primary data collection, to support the aims of its impact evaluation component. The impact evaluation is likely to employ quasi-experimental impact analysis, which will be scoped in partnership with existing academic experts. This may be supplemented by theory-based approaches, such as contribution analysis, where particular impacts do not lend themselves to quasi-experimental approaches.</p>

          <p>It is most likely that this evaluation will adopt a hybrid delivery approach, whereby responsibility for undertaking the evaluation is split between DESNZ analysts and external evaluation suppliers. This approach would see external evaluation suppliers collecting primary data, leading on the majority of analysis and producing outputs, to ensure the impartiality of this work. The supplier will be recruited through a fair and open competition and will be assessed based on price and the quality of their bid for this project. However, where the skills of internal DESNZ analysis can be utilised, such as in undertaking basic statistical analysis of monitoring data or producing cost-benefit analysis, they will undertake this work, subject to oversight from the supplier, to ensure value-for-money.</p>

        <content>
          <p>In this sensitivity analysis we explore a scenario with 50% cost reductions by 2030. This assumption is dependent on innovation in the equipment as well as economies of scale benefits in heat pump installations. We have also assumed a lower cost reduction scenario with a 10% cost reduction by 2030. In both scenarios we have assumed a linear cost reduction from 2025 to 2030. </p>

        <content>
          <p>In the high end of this scenario, we assume that half of the On Gas-grid market mechanism additional installations are hybrid heat pumps, in which a heat pump works together with a gas boiler. We also assume a low scenario where no hybrids are deployed. In all scenarios, we assume the heat pump component to meet 65% of the heat demand with the gas boiler meeting the remaining 35%. </p>

        <content>
          <p>In this scenario we assume that firms are allowed to carry forward 35% of their deployment credits into the next year. This results in year 1 heat pump deployment being 65% of the year 1 target and year 2 deployment being 65% of the year two target, plus the remaining 35% of year one deployment that was carried over. The Regulations don’t have carryover allowance from FY 28/29, the final year of the assessed period, so we have assumed that no heat pumps can be carried forward in this year.</p>
