                      <p class="ia-table-text">Until the Pension Schemes Act 2021 (the 2021 Act)<authorialNote marker="1"><p class="ia-table-text"> https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2021/1/contents/enacted/data.htm</p></authorialNote>, the UK’s workplace pensions legislative framework was, broadly speaking, binary in nature with employers enabled to offer either Defined Benefit (DB) or Defined Contribution (DC) occupational pension schemes. The two models place the majority of the risks and associated costs – economic, financial, and longevity - with either the sponsoring employer (DB) or the individual member (DC). Following engagement with representatives from the pensions industry, Government decided to introduce a further option for the pensions industry called Collective Defined Contribution (CDC) schemes. CDC schemes could be beneficial to sponsoring businesses and individuals in certain cases. The legislative term for CDCs is Collective Money Purchase (CMP), but we will refer to CDCs in this document. </p>
                      <p class="ia-table-text" />
                      <p class="ia-table-text">The 2021 Act provides the legislative framework to establish and operate CDC schemes. Secondary legislation will establish a secure regulatory framework within which single or connected employers can create CDC type pension schemes with adequate governance and safeguards in place for members and for employers. This sets out what CDC schemes must do to become authorised, to operate effectively in the market under regulatory oversight, and what happens if changes need to be made to schemes.</p>
                      <p class="ia-table-text" />
                      <p class="ia-table-text">The authorisation regime is designed to protect members and to build confidence in this new form of money purchase occupational pension provision by ensuring only well designed and run schemes are able to operate. This should therefore provide protection to members’ savings and future retirement income by ensuring only well-run and designed CDC are established. These regulations do not mandate CDCs but provides a framework if an employer wants to set up a CDC scheme. We only expect businesses to incur any gross costs if the expected benefits outweigh the additional costs.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">The rationale for intervention and therefore the introduction of CDCs is to create more flexibility in occupational pension provision so there is a new type of scheme that is:</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">• more sustainable for sponsoring employers than a DB scheme because it does not place any unpredictable future liabilities on them;</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">As the Bill Stage Impact Assessment<authorialNote marker="2"><p class="ia-table-text"><b> https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/lbill/58-01/004/5801004-IA-Annex-G.pdf</b></p></authorialNote> did not monetise the impacts of any provisions made in the 2021 Act; we are treating Option 0 as the counterfactual where primary legislation was not enacted. Therefore, the counterfactual is a pensions market where CDC schemes do not exist and businesses must provide either a DB, DC, or hybrid workplace pension scheme for eligible employees.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text" />
                <p class="ia-table-text"><b>Policy Option 0: Do nothing - As if no provisions of the 2021 Act had been enacted</b></p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">Do nothing is the basis of our counterfactual. All businesses are required to enrol their eligible employees into a workplace pension so there would still be running costs associated with their current pension scheme. However, this option would mean less opportunity, choice, and flexibility for both employers and workers. A well-designed CDC scheme has the potential to offer a more predictable income in retirement for scheme members than for DC members who do not wish to purchase an annuity. It achieves this by pooling risks and smoothing pensions payments (for example softening the impacts during periods when investment returns are relatively low, and benefits may need to be reduced) whilst being more sustainable to sponsoring employers than DB. </p>
                <p class="ia-table-text" />
                <p class="ia-table-text"><b>Policy Option 1: Guidance around authorisation and scheme design  </b></p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">This is a non-regulatory policy option and involves issuing guidance to businesses and CDC trustees about member protections and ongoing supervision. This would encourage trustees to consider the risks of scheme design and financial sustainability whilst outlining how best to safeguard members and their savings. However, this option provides no regulatory protection for members and their savings. This could put them at risk of being enrolled in a poorly designed pension scheme. Without regulation, trustees are unlikely to fully consider the wide-ranging impacts that CDCs may incur that may negatively impact the interests of members. Without the full legislative framework, employers and potential members are unlikely to commit to CDC due to legal uncertainty in the face of challenge. Within legislation CDC schemes cannot be fully implemented and within the current automatic enrolment provisions trustees would be limited in what actions they could take.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text" />
                <p class="ia-table-text"><b>Policy Option 2: Introducing secondary legislation to outline the authorisation and supervision regime (preferred option)</b></p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">This option establishes the authorisation and supervision regime for CDCs as well as the relevant consequential amendments. The novelty and potential complexity of CDC models requires specific and targeted supervision to ensure they maintain the confidence of employers and scheme members. The authorisation and supervision regime is designed to protect members and to build confidence in this new form of money purchase occupational pension provision by ensuring only soundly designed and well-run schemes can operate. Therefore, members should be safeguarded from paying into poorly designed or managed schemes. </p>
                <p class="ia-table-text" />
                <p class="ia-table-text">This option is likely to incur costs to businesses who choose to set up a CDC scheme because they must meet the authorisation criteria and ongoing supervisory requirements. However, businesses and employers should already have an established pension scheme to meet their automatic enrolment duties. Any new costs associated with setting up a CDC scheme would be voluntary as they could use the existing DC or DB provisions they currently provide to meet their automatic enrolment obligations.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">These costs are therefore as a result of a commercially viable decision, the regulatory framework is a marginal cost on top of that.

Specifically: </p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">• The <b>costs and benefits depend on the counterfactual</b> (whether a firm’s employees would in future be enrolled in a DB scheme, a DC scheme, or a hybrid DB/DC scheme<b>) which is not possible to predict</b>. Particularly in the case for DB employers, there are uncertainties as to whether they would switch to DC in the absence of CDC legislation.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">• Consultation responses illustrated further interest in CDC amongst the wider pensions industry but did not identify new plans to deliver CDC. Consequently, <b>the potential take-up of CDCs from employers is currently an unknown with only the Royal Mail Group having clear plans to deliver CDC</b>. Therefore, on the grounds of commercial sensitivity, we were not able to set out the direct impact to business.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text" />
                <p class="ia-table-text"><b>We still believe both these points are relevant. </b>It is still not possible to predict the counterfactual or whether an employer would switch schemes in the absence of CDC legislation. We are also not aware of any other businesses having clear plans to deliver a CDC scheme. </p>
                <p class="ia-table-text" />
                <p class="ia-table-text"><b>Many of the regulations specify clear minimum standards that must be met by CDCs in order to gain authorisation but are not overly prescriptive on how the CDCs should meet them</b>. This adds to the uncertainty around any estimates of the costs of this policy. Some detail about how schemes can demonstrate that they meet these requirements will be set out in the Pension Regulator’s Code which will be published, following consultation and approval by Parliament, after this impact assessment.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text" />
                <p class="ia-table-text">At this stage there is still considerable uncertainty over the full impacts of the proposal, and the exact content of the Regulator’s Code of Practice (Code) is yet to be finalised. Some impacts will depend on specific features of the CDC schemes applying for authorisation, of which there are a wide variety, which creates some uncertainty about the costs. </p>

          <p>Until the Pension Schemes Act 2021<authorialNote marker="4"><p> https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2021/1/contents/enacted/data.htm</p></authorialNote>, the UK’s workplace pensions legislative framework was, broadly speaking, binary in nature with employers enabled to offer only Defined Benefit (DB) or Defined Contribution (DC) occupational pension schemes.</p>

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>DB schemes offer greater certainty and predictability of income in retirement for employees but place significant risks and costs on the sponsoring employer because of the guarantee to members involved with such schemes. Conversely, DC schemes place the majority of the risks and costs on the individual scheme member. This is set out below in Table 1:</p>

          <p>In a CDC scheme, the contributions of employers and employees are invested in a collective fund. When the member retires, they are paid a pension based on their share of that collective fund. The value of this pension will be based on the total value of the collective fund and will increase or decrease according to changes in investment performance or other risk factors. </p>

          <p>CDC schemes will have an aspired to pensions level it will aim to pay members based on their share of the collective fund.

Currentl<i>y, </i>only 11% of all DB schemes (including hybrid schemes) are open to new members, down from 43% in 2006<authorialNote marker="10"><p> https://www.ppf.co.uk/sites/default/files/2020-12/PPF_Purple_Book_20.pdf</p></authorialNote>. DB pensions are gradually being replaced with DC, where the risk is concentrated with each individual member, making them more sustainable for the sponsoring employers but riskier and more uncertain for the scheme members.</p>

          <p>In CDCs, the risks are placed with the members, but they are shared among the members, thus allowing pensions provision to be smoothed out during different economic times. CDCs differ from the traditional DC schemes because it does not produce an individual "pension pot" which members then must decide how best to use to fund their retirement. Instead, CDCs pay out a regular retirement income from the collective fund taking away the need for members to make complex financial decisions. Whilst members of CDC schemes are able to transfer out their share of the fund at any point, CDCs take the big central decision of having to choose the right financial product out of retirement planning, as well as much of the risk, as members who stay in the scheme can rely on a regular, if variable, income throughout retirement.</p>

However, no business would be able to create a CDC scheme. Therefore, it would mean less opportunity, choice, and flexibility for both employers and workers. Not providing the option of CDC would prevent employers and workforces from being able to select a pension arrangement that may better suit their circumstances and would present an opportunity cost.</p>

        <content>
          <p>However, this option provides no regulatory protection for members and their savings which could put them at risk of being enrolled in a poorly designed scheme. Without regulation, trustees are unlikely to fully consider the risks and benefits to members of CDCs. It also gives businesses significant freedom to design a CDC in any way without considering the relevant risks. This option could result in the creation of very large schemes which pose a high risk to members or to particular cohorts of members. Without the necessary protection these schemes may be unsustainable and more likely fail, thus incurring greater costs to members and employers in the long term. This option risks damaging confidence in CDC and its potential to offer an attractive alternative to existing pension saving options.</p>

          <p>The counterfactual is the ‘do nothing’ option. As stated, whilst this regulatory framework is a marginal additional cost incurred over and above the costs which firms choose when opting to set up a CDC. For completeness, as no estimates were made of costs, the counterfactual assumes there could be no CDC without this change. Therefore, this is where a business must enrol eligible employees into either a DB or DC workplace pension scheme in order to fulfil their automatic enrolment duties. Depending on whether a business offers a DB or DC scheme there may be different costs and benefits as discussed below. Regardless of the counterfactual, we only anticipate these direct costs to be incurred if the business expects the benefits to outweigh the costs.</p>

        <content>
          <p>Where the counterfactual is DB, savings to sponsoring businesses may be substantial. New private sector DB schemes are no longer being created in practice and where DB promises already exist employers cannot break them. However, they may choose to close their schemes to new members and/or future accruals.</p>

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>DB sponsoring businesses may also incur indirect costs associated with the natural uncertainties arising from their commitment to sponsor a DB scheme. For example, any changes in life expectancy and/or investment return forecasts would alter their estimated DB pension liabilities and thus their balance sheets, making them more uncertain and volatile, and in turn potentially making their business less attractive to potential investors or creditors.</p>

        <content>
          <p>Where the counterfactual is DC, there may be some differences in direct costs to sponsoring businesses. CDC schemes are likely to incur greater costs in the running and set up of the scheme in comparison to a conventional DC scheme. For example, employers who decide to use Nest or another Master Trust to fulfil their automatic enrolment duties have minimal costs. Larger employers who run their own DC scheme may see more comparable costs with CDC schemes although we acknowledge that there may be some differences such as the actuarial input needed in CDC schemes. For example, CDC schemes are required to undertake an annual valuation of the collective funds, which may result in some differences in scheme running costs, when compared against DC.</p>

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Where the counterfactual is DC, we do not envisage fundamental differences in direct costs to sponsoring businesses so there are no anticipated savings to business in terms of lower pension scheme costs. It is possible that moving from DC to CDC would result in benefits to employers in terms of improved employee retention, but we do not have any robust evidence to estimate this.</p>

          <p>We still believe both these points are relevant. It is still not possible to predict the counterfactual or whether an employer would switch schemes in the absence of CDC legislation. We are also still aware only the Royal Mail Group having clear plans to deliver a CDC scheme. </p>

          <p>At this stage there is still considerable uncertainty over the full impacts of the proposal, and the exact content of the Regulator’s Code is yet to be finalised. Some impacts will depend on specific features of the CDC schemes applying for authorisation, of which there may be a wide variety, which creates some uncertainty about the costs. </p>

          <p>Many of the regulations specify clear minimum standards that must be met by CDCs in order to gain authorisation but are not overly prescriptive on how the CDCs should meet them. This adds to the uncertainty around any estimates of the costs of this policy. Some detail about how schemes can demonstrate that they meet these requirements will be set out in the Regulator’s Code, which is likely to be published after this impact assessment.</p>

          <p>The Regulator will consider the evidence provided when deciding whether an individual meets the fit and proper requirement. It is possible that someone might not meet this requirement and will need to be replaced. Evidence suggests, however, that few people fail the FCA’s Approved Persons Regime<authorialNote marker="31"><p> http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-fca-appointments-idUKBRE93B06P20130412</p></authorialNote>. We do not therefore believe that there will be a significant failure rate for the Regulator’s fit and proper tests, given the relatively low number of people that will be checked in this policy option compared to under FCA’s regime. In addition, the Regulator’s Code of Practice will make clear what checks will take place.</p>

          <p>Each CDC scheme will have to hold or be able to access a different amount of money for the financial sustainability requirement, which will be heavily dependent on a variety of factors, including scale, but the baseline is that trustees should have access to sufficient funds to meet the relevant costs at the point they are needed. Schemes will have to spend time assessing and reviewing the initial and on-going cost of running the scheme and the estimated cost of resolving potential triggering events, such as the need to wind up the scheme. The CDC regime does provide flexibility to accommodate a range of financing arrangements. The Regulator’s forthcoming code will provide further information on these and other matters. </p>

          <p>If a scheme is unable to meet relevant costs from member-borne charges, then the establishing employer may need to help out.

          <p>These estimates carry with them a significant degree of uncertainty, as the running costs of a scheme depend heavily on a number of different factors, such as whether the scheme uses a third-party administrator, or does the work in-house, and scale. Much of this is commercially sensitive so we have assumed it may take two trustees around eight hours to gather the relevant evidence required for this criterion. </p>

There was a range of responses suggesting transition could take between one to two years, but we have assumed it would take around one year to design new member communications; including any testing and time for sign off. The main cost would be for marketing colleagues to draft new communications materials and then getting these signed off by the relevant trustee:</heading>

Given that CDC schemes will be established by single connected employers with existing communication systems, we assume communications will likely be done by email and therefore incur negligible costs. If businesses choose to send out communications via alternative methods, such as by post, this would incur an additional cost.

However, we have assumed that schemes applying for CDC authorisation will take longer to prepare their continuity strategy given that, compared to Master Trusts, CDC schemes have an extra continuity option which they will need to account for. </p>

          <p>Each year after authorisation, CDC schemes are required to run an actuarial valuation and benefit adjustment process. Benefits can be adjusted every year in order to keep the value of assets held and the projected costs of benefits in balance, so the schemes are financially sound. The regulations outline strict rules for CDC schemes to follow around benefit adjustment, which ensure that all members are subject to the same adjustments.</p>

          <p>There was a concern expressed about how members, especially pensioner members, would adapt to sudden decreases in benefits. We believe that for a well-designed CDC scheme, cutting the rate of benefit in payment should be a rare event. But we are conscious that in some extreme scenarios cuts in benefit of several percentage points might be needed. This will be mitigated by the multi-annual reduction mechanism, which is designed to help smooth the impact of reductions, included in the regulations. </p>

          <p>If we assume only larger employers will open a CDC scheme, then the very large scheme estimate may be the most suitable.

          <p>Therefore, the cost of the annual valuation and benefit adjustment is £334,200, each year after authorisation. If a business has an existing DC scheme and they transition to a CDC they will incur an additional cost in the yearly valuation of the scheme. Existing DB schemes currently run triennial valuations and we would expect the cost of these to be higher than the annual valuation required for CDCs, however, we do not know by how much at this stage so cannot estimate the potential savings. </p>

          <p>Significant events are events that may affect the ability of an authorised CDC scheme to continue to meet the authorisation criteria. For example, if a scheme has a change of trustee this is a significant event because the fitness and propriety of a trustee is linked to the authorisation criteria. The Regulator must be notified in writing, as soon as reasonably practicable, if a significant event has occurred to an authorised CDC scheme. </p>

      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>These requirements are designed to protect members by ensuring that the Regulator is made aware of such events and can engage with the scheme as necessary to obtain additional information or require action to be taken.

          <p>The risk notice requires trustees to set out how the issue will be resolved by submitting a resolution plan to the Regulator.

          <p>DB sponsoring businesses may also incur indirect costs associated with the natural uncertainties arising from their commitment to sponsor a DB scheme. For example, any changes in life expectancy and/or investment return forecasts would alter their estimated DB pension liabilities and thus their balance sheets, making them more uncertain and volatile, and in turn potentially making their business less attractive to potential investors or creditors. Replacing DB with CDC would result in a saving in this sense as well. There is a strong financial incentive for DB sponsoring businesses to switch to CDC, but it is not possible to know how many of these would have switched to DC in the counterfactual scenario with no CDC option.</p>

          <p>Where the counterfactual is DB, all members are expected to face greater uncertainty in their pension income under CDC given that all the risks and associated costs under CDC are with them rather than their employer.

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Any collective scheme will smooth, to a certain extent, outcomes between members and outcomes over time. So, whilst overall members might benefit, some may experience a worse outcome than under an individual DC. One reason for this is that a member could be due to retire in ‘strong’ economic conditions and potentially may have received a higher income from annuitizing than under the smoothed CDC benefits. However, the risk of the member retiring in ‘strong’ economic conditions is placed solely on the member.</p>

        <content>
          <p>A further reason is that the member may die at a young age. This is an inevitable consequence of pooling risk and happens in both DB schemes and annuities where those that die young subsidise the pensions of those that live longer. </p>

          <p>For example, some members may choose for their pension to be invested in higher risk investment strategies or prefer Environmental, Social and Governance (ESG) funds. However, if an employer who currently offers a DC scheme chooses to offer a CDC scheme, there may be individuals that prefer a DC scheme and the flexible investment choice.

          <p>In this case members would either have the option to potentially move jobs to an employer that offers a DC scheme, transfer out of the CDC scheme itself or negotiate with their employer to contribute to a separate scheme, as is currently the case for members of occupational schemes that are not happy with their current pension arrangements.

They found that, for a CDC member about to retire, the Q1 market shock would have little effect on their initial retirement income, but potentially a modest reduction in long-term future pension increases depending on how markets develop. As intended, Q1 market falls would have been smoothed out and the member could retire as planned without the need to face a difficult retirement decision. By contrast, a member about to retire with a DC pension would be facing an 8% reduction in their pension due to unlucky timing.</p>

Also, de-risking in DC may mean purchasing annuities during ‘adverse’ times, e.g., when gilt yields are low; whereas in CDC, annuities are not necessary to provide a lifetime stream of pensions income. </p>

          <p>Annuities are insurance policies which pay an annual income for life in exchange for a lump sum. DC members can use their pension pot (or part of it) to buy an annuity and have a guaranteed stream of income for their whole lifetime. But buying an annuity may be costly as the price has to cover not only the insurer’s costs of providing it but also the insurer’s premium and other fees. For example, Longevitas<authorialNote marker="59"><p> https://www.longevitas.co.uk/site/informationmatrix/areannuitiesexpensiveenough.html</p></authorialNote> say that ‘an insurer in the UK will typically charge around 5% more than it expects the annuity to cost’.

In the case of Royal Mail specifically, this extends to improving industrial relations with up to 140,000 employees. As such, there is the potential for improved economic output to the wider economy – this is especially the case given the nature of postal services provided by Royal Mail. However, estimating the extent to this is beyond the scope of this Impact Assessment given its complexity.</p>

          <p>In principle, CDC plan design involves risk sharing, which is likely to occur both between the members of the same cohort and between different cohorts. Critics of CDCs often claim that they are inherently unfair towards younger generations as older people may have first call on the pooled fund to pay their pensions, and workers may have to make up any shortfall with increased contributions. The main lesson to be learned from abroad is the Dutch experience. The Dutch regulatory system for CDCs requires a very high level of certainty that target benefits and inflation increases can be paid by prescribing large funding buffers. Slow growth in asset values means that when the buffers were expended in the financial crisis, they could only be restored through increased contributions from younger workers<authorialNote marker="61"><p> https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201719/cmselect/cmworpen/580/580.pdf</p></authorialNote>. </p>

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>We believe it is possible to design a CDC scheme model to mitigate these risks. A possible solution, as presented to us by Royal Mail, could involve ensuring that: (a) adjustments to benefits are not perfectly smoothed, (b) that adjustments to benefits required by under or over funding take place frequently (e.g., annually), and (c) that all cohorts of members are treated the same when adjustments are made. This means no funding buffers, and no need for additional funding from younger members to pay out pensions to older workers. In that case it is highly likely that members would see more volatility year on year than in the Dutch system, but an initial analysis and advice provided to us by Royal Mail suggest that in almost all years’ pensions in payment, and target pensions for those yet to retire, could increase by inflation plus or minus 1 or 2%, per year. </p>

          <p>Some other views from the pensions industry also seem to suggest the risk of intergenerational fairness is solvable. AoN Hewitt, for example, mention that dealing with these issues of smoothing requires very careful communication to members and good actuarial processes<authorialNote marker="62"><p>http://www.aon.com/unitedkingdom/attachments/aon_hewitt/dc/Aon_Hewitt_The_Case_for_Collective_DC_Nov13.pdf</p></authorialNote>. </p>

        <content>
          <p>CDC schemes will be required to have processes in place to ensure their members can understand that benefit levels might be regularly adjusted accordingly. We anticipate that CDC schemes will make use of modern methods of communication, including social media and video to help ensure members can access the information they need to do this in the most appropriate way for them.</p>

          <p>There is no evidence of any disproportionate cost on small and micro businesses for this legislative change. This proposal creates the option for employers to enrol their employees into a CDC pension scheme. Therefore, businesses will only undertake the associated costs of enrolling their employees into a CDC scheme if they believe it to be beneficial for them to do so relative to the next best alternative. </p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Moreover, although all businesses will have the option to do this, we expect large employers to be more likely to undertake this option due to the advantages of economies of scale, the pooling of risk among a larger group of members and the greater the ability to undertake more long-term investment strategies. This opinion is supported by industry in the consultation responses.</p>

          <p>The legislative framework aims to provide transparency about the operation and effectiveness of CDC schemes and requires the publication of certain scheme information. In addition, the Regulator plan to collect and monitor data on CDC schemes in the same way as they currently do for occupational DB and DC schemes, looking at schemes, members, and assets. DWP will monitor how the first CDC schemes operate and their performance and effectiveness at providing pension incomes, using this information. </p>

          <p>The authorisation and supervision process will require schemes to set out and report on their on-going viability informed by their annual valuations and taking account of any guidance produced by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries. This will allow an assessment of these schemes to provide the level of income they aspire to, to be made on an on-going basis. </p>

        <content>
          <p>In addition, we will engage proactively with employers, workforce representatives and schemes to identify any issues they are having around the new regime as it beds in and seek views from schemes and the Regulator to provide assurance on the effectiveness of the authorisation framework. Investment and providing pension income is a long-term proposition and as such monitoring will be on-going. </p>

          <p>The costs and benefits are highly dependent on the counterfactual (whether a firm’s employees would in future be enrolled in a DB scheme, a DC scheme, or a hybrid DB/DC scheme) which is not possible to predict. Particularly for DB employers, there are uncertainties as to whether they would switch to DC in the absence of CDC legislation. <b>In any counterfactual all employers with eligible employees will be required to set up a workplace pension and automatically enrol eligible employees.</b> Therefore, there are some costs that businesses would still incur regardless of whether they adopted a CDC scheme. For these costs we estimate there to be a net zero cost because businesses would have had to undertake them under any counterfactual.</p>

However, at this stage we are only aware of one employer, Royal Mail Group, who has a clear plan to deliver a CDC scheme. For this employer, they have undertaken extensive additional scoping and implementation work which other schemes would be unlikely to incur. The Royal Mail Group CDC scheme is highly specific and to extrapolate costs or benefits for this employer to wide businesses would be highly commercially sensitive and speculative. Give no other businesses are currently developing plans to adopt a CDC we are unable to present aggregate costs or benefits. The Institute and Faculty of Actuaries CDC Pension Scheme Regulatory Working Party suggested has been informed that it is unlikely another CDC scheme will open within a year of the Royal Mail Group, and that there are unlikely to be more than ten CDC schemes by 2025<authorialNote marker="65"><p> https://www.actuaries.org.uk/system/files/field/document/RB%20May%202021%20CDC%20Working%20Party%20Paper.pdf</p></authorialNote>.</p>

        <content>
          <p>Moreover, at this stage we only expect larger businesses to be able to offer CDC schemes. The legislation only allows for single or connected employers and therefore, an employer must be large enough to sustain the contributions required for a CDC scheme over the long term. It is highly unlikely smaller or medium sized employers would be able to afford the costs of setting up a new scheme and maintain the long-term employee contributions required for a successful CDC scheme. </p>

          <p>Engagement with industry has suggested once CDC regulations are laid and more schemes are set up, the process and costs associated with setting up should be lower. This is because businesses will have clear regulations and guidance to follow, and they can learn from the schemes set up earlier.</p>

        <content>
          <p>The regulations for CDC schemes are designed to give businesses the ability to design the scheme around their needs and business. There is significant scope for bespoke scheme design. Whilst the Royal Mail Group are designing a CDC scheme that suits their business needs, this design may be unsuitable for another larger employer. Therefore, the current regulations outline the minimum standards for CDC schemes, but businesses may choose to do additional work, which may incur higher costs, depending on how they decide to set up and run their scheme. </p>

      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>We are not certain how other models, outside the Royal Mail Group, might look like. Scheme design is heavily choice driven. For example, some businesses may opt for higher benefit rates or contribution rates. There may be circumstances where businesses create a scheme with more regular communications with members than the statutory requirements. Therefore, we are not able to estimate the exact costs of all potential CDC scheme designs. There may be circumstances where businesses incur higher or lower costs depending on their bespoke scheme design. </p>
