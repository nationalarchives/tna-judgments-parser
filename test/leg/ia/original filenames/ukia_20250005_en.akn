Along with most other member states, the UK was unable to achieve the higher target (65%) between 2019 and leaving the EU. The compliance fee and household WEEE collection targets have been instrumental in decreasing cost of evidence and enabling costs correction of WEEE evidence. There has been high compliance among UK based business but compliance by online businesses - particularly those overseas and more recently amongst producers of vapes - has been lower.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">The original assumptions were set out in two impact assessments accompanying the Government response to the implementation of the WEEE Directive and changes to the UK WEEE system. One was an Impact Assessment of the recast Directive 2012/96/EU on WEEE and the other an Impact Assessment of the UK WEEE System. A key assumption was that a compliance fee would be charged to individual producer compliance schemes (PCSs) in the event that they did not meet their household WEEE collection target. The compliance fee would be set at a level that put a ‘price ceiling’ on the cost of evidence in order to restrict the risk that costs of collection and treatment paid by producers through PCSs was often much higher that the true costs of collection and treatment of WEEE. Within the Impact Assessment which accompanied the Government response to the implementation of the WEEE Directive and changes to the UK WEEE system, the central scenario assumed an additional 10% of WEEE tonnage of gas discharge lamps (GDLs), displays and cooling products would be funded through the compliance fee. Photovoltaic (PV) panels come into scope with the introduction of the 2013 Regulations. It was assumed that 45% of PV EEE put on market (POM) would be collected as WEEE.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">The previous PIR highlighted the burdensome way that Regulation 34 worked for local authorities which has been addressed. This provides a guarantee that PCSs would always finance the costs of collection and subsequent treatment of WEEE arising at “Designated Collection Facilities” even in circumstances where no individual PCS was willing to enter a contact. Whilst measures have largely been successful in ensuring the system brings proportionate costs to businesses, the system does not provide levers that maximise the level of separately collected WEEE financed by producers or that ensure re-use is prioritised over recycling. Changes are necessary to ensure better communication with householders on how to dispose of WEEE and measures that make it easier for householders and business to send unwanted equipment for reuse/recycling. The focus on promoting recycling over landfill has resulted in a lack of measures within the legislation designed to support the circular economy.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">The significant rise in internet sales since the inception of the original regulations and the surge on the sale of vapes has recreated some unfair cost distribution (and consequential burdens) across those organisations defined as producers.  The consultation proposals and subsequent government response seek to address those anomalies by creating a new category of equipment for vapes and creating a new category of producer for online market places who would in future have a financial obligation for WEEE collections in respect of the equipment placed on their UK market by overseas sellers.  Wider potential opportunities have been identified to reduce compliance costs placed on businesses that adopt circular economy business models and those supplying equipment that meet specific eco-design requirements.</p>
