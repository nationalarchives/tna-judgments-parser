Non-regulatory intervention is expected to double this proportion. In the absence of regulation, firms will be expected to familiarise themselves with only updated guidance rather than new regulations. Only firms who voluntarily comply would be expected to make systems changes (£11.2m). Costs to creditors would therefore be lower than under a regulatory Breathing Space: foregone interest (£575.3m) and fees (£78.4m), delayed revenue (£0.5m), administrative costs (£114m), familiarisation costs (£0.2m), and dissemination costs (£1.9m).

                  <p class="ia-table-text">There is a high degree of uncertainty around the relationship between the incentive to seek debt advice and the strength of the consumer protections that debt advice can provide. Debt advisers estimated that Breathing Space will increase the number of debtors who seek advice by 10% per annum. Creditor non- compliance would reduce the strength of the consumer protections accessible via Breathing Space, which would decrease the incentive to seek advice. This would reduce the forecast 10% uplift in debt advice take- up. In the absence of evidence on which to base an assumption for the extent to which the 10% assumption would fall, it has been assumed to fall to 5% per annum. Debt advice agencies suggested that Breathing Space will increase the benefit of debt advice by 14%. Debtors will not derive this full marginal benefit if not all of their creditors offer the protections of Breathing Space voluntarily. This relationship will not be direct – the benefit of Breathing Space when only 40% of creditors comply will not be 40% of 14%. Exactly how much lower the marginal benefit of debt advice will be given incomplete coverage is unclear, but it is assumed to be half that of a regulatory version of the scheme, at 7%.</p>

Debt advice agencies estimated that the value of debt advice will be 14% higher under Breathing Space and it is forecast that an additional 1.3m debtors will seek advice over the assessment period as a result of Breathing Space. This will promote higher recoveries for creditors (£6109.0m), deliver productivity benefits for employers (£3708.3m), and reduce negative mental and physical health outcomes amongst debtors (£2153.4m).

            <p>Advice to the government from the Money and Pensions Service (MAPS) states that individuals in problem debt often have internal barriers where their attitudes, emotions and knowledge impact their willingness to seek advice.5 MAPS suggest that people in problem debt often deny the severity of their circumstances, partly as a result of the stigma attached to being in problem debt. For others, fear, shame, embarrassment, and the hope that they will be able to resolve their problem debt without professional help cause them to delay seeking advice.6</p>

            <p>Debtors who are at crisis point when they seek advice are less likely to achieve an optimum outcome from debt advice. Research by the Money Advice Service suggests that the stress and anxiety of problem debt results in people being more likely to ignore essential communication, to report feeling overwhelmed by information about debt solutions, and to choose poorer debt solutions, often opting for quick fixes over more sustainable debt solutions.7</p>

            <p>Not all debtors who need it are shown this forbearance. The FCA does not mandate that the firms it regulates undertake these steps and, in any case, debtors can owe money to firms in a host of different sectors which are not FCA regulated, such as utility companies, landlords, and the public sector. The enforcement and forbearance practices that debtors experience can therefore be very varied.</p>

            <p>If creditors more consistently provide forbearance and pause enforcement action for those who are in the process of engaging with debt advice, those individuals will have the headspace to engage more effectively to achieve more sustainable solutions. Making debt advice the gateway to such protections would also make debt advice more attractive to those who need it, incentivising them to seek advice and to seek it sooner.</p>

            <p>First, this assessment considers doing nothing. This would see no change in counterfactual debt advice take-up or outcomes and so no additional costs or benefits. Take-up of debt advice would rise, but more slowly than under a mandatory Breathing Space. The benefits of debt advice would accrue accordingly, but debt advice would be less beneficial than under Breathing Space.</p>

            <p>Next, a voluntary approach to delivering Breathing Space is assessed. This would see the government work with creditors, trade bodies, and regulators to encourage more creditors to freeze interest, fees, and charges, to refrain from contacting debtors, and to pause enforcement action where debtors are in financial hardship. More creditors would offer these protections than do in the counterfactual, but fewer than would do so under a regulatory Breathing Space. As a result of incomplete coverage, the rate of increase in take-up of debt advice and the marginal benefit of debt advice would be lower than under a regulatory version of Breathing Space.</p>

            <p>Finally, this assessment considers a regulatory Breathing Space. This will pause enforcement action; freeze interest, fees, and charges, and pause creditor contact with debtors where it relates to debt repayment. These protections would last for a 60-day period and be accessible via professional debt advice. This is expected to increase take-up of debt advice and the benefit of debt advice.</p>

            <p>Breathing Space will also include a Mental Health Crisis Moratorium for those receiving mental health crisis treatment. For this group, the protections of Breathing Space will last for the duration of their crisis treatment, followed by a further 30 days. The Money and Mental Health Policy Institute estimate that the median duration of in-patient psychiatric treatment is 34 days. This suggests that the median duration within the Mental Health Crisis Moratorium before entering the main protections of Breathing Space is 64 days.</p>

            <p>Not all debtors will remain within the protections of Breathing Space for its full 60-day duration. Breathing Space will impose a number of obligations on debtors, including: not taking out further credit of £500 or more without the approval of their debt advisor, continuing to meet their ongoing liabilities where they are able to do so, and continuing to engage with debt advice with a view to finding a debt solution. Where they are notified of a failure to meet the ongoing eligibility criteria, debt advisers will administer an ongoing eligibility check at the 30-day point, removing debtors who have not met the ongoing eligibility criteria.11</p>

            <p>MAPS’s best estimate, based on debt advice provider data, is that 16.7% of the debt advice sessions that are recorded annually are likely to be duplicates. That is, they are likely to record the same debtor receiving separate advice more than once in a 12-month period. Breathing Space will only be accessible once per year, so duplicates are removed from the counterfactual.</p>

            <p>MAPS estimate that 7.5% of debt advice is supplied in Scotland and Northern Ireland.12 The territorial extent of Breathing Space will be England and Wales, so debt advice supplied in Scotland and Northern Ireland will not lead to Breathing Space. Advice supplied in Scotland and Northern Ireland is therefore removed from the counterfactual.</p>

            <p>From this starting point, debt advice supply may be forecast across the assessment period. As Peter Wyman pointed out in his Independent Review of Debt Advice Funding, forecasting future take-up of debt advice is challenging given the complexity of the relationship between levels of over indebtedness and wider macroeconomic factors. Partly for this reason, there is no official forecast of debt advice supply across the period that this impact assessment examines.</p>

            <p>In the absence of an official forecast, the three-year trend is extrapolated across the assessment period. Debt advice is supplied via three primary channels: telephone, face-to-face, and online. As Table 2, below, shows, there has been significant volatility in the supply of advice via each channel. This volatility has been most pronounced in the online advice channel. This reflects a sector-wide strategy of increasing debt advice supply by reducing the unit costs of debt advice. As online advice is cheapest to supply, the debt advice sector has sought to increase supply of advice via this channel.</p>

            <p>As online-channel debt advice reaches an optimum point, the annual increase in online debt advice is expected to revert to a similar level as that of telephone and face-to-face advice. There is uncertainty as to when this optimum point will be reached. This forecast assumes that it is reached in 2018-19. Therefore, in this forecast of counterfactual debt advice supply across the assessment period, the baseline annual increase in debt advice supply is taken to be the mean of the annual change in debt advice supply delivered by the telephone and face-to-face channels.</p>

In his independent review of debt advice funding, Peter Wyman recommended that a wider range of creditors should contribute to debt advice funding.14 Wyman proposed that this objective should be achieved through the development of a code of conduct by creditor trade bodies. Over a year after the publication of Wyman’s recommendation, compliance with this recommendation has been limited. This suggests that compliance with a voluntary Breathing Space would be incomplete.</p>

            <p>The benefits of a voluntary Breathing Space are superior to doing nothing as some creditors would voluntarily deliver the protections of Breathing Space. However, the majority would not. The marginal benefits of Breathing Space apply per person, not per debt. Debt advice agencies estimate that debtors hold an average of 4 to 6 debts at the point of seeking advice. As a result of non-compliance in a significant minority of cases, it is unlikely that debtors will gain the headspace to engage fully with debt advice.</p>

            <p>It is uncertain how much this would reduce the 14% marginal benefit of debt advice under Breathing Space. It is clear, though, that the relationship is not direct.

            <p>Non-compliance will reduce the extent to which debtors find the best debt solutions for them and the higher creditor recoveries that this yields; it would reduce the extent to which Breathing Space counters absenteeism and presenteeism amongst employed debtors, lowering with it the benefits to employers, and most obviously, it would limit the improvement in debtor quality of life that a regulatory Breathing Space could deliver by countering debtors’ sense of impending enforcement action and spiralling debts. For these reasons, it is assumed that non- compliance would reduce the marginal benefits of debt advice under Breathing Space from 14% to 7%.</p>

Counterfactual debt advice take-up has been discussed in section 6, where it was projected that it would rise from 1.3m to 2.1m between 2021-22 and 2030-31.

            <p>The initial eligibility criteria set out that the scheme is accessible only to people in problem debt who are likely to be able to access a debt solution and for whom such a solution would be in their best interests.16 Engagement with debt advice agencies suggested that, on average, 60% of those who receive debt advice are advised to enter a debt solution. This group would meet the initial eligibility criteria in full. The Breathing Space caseload is therefore forecast to be 60% of the maximum caseload as set out in paragraph 8.1, which is 800,000 in 2021-22, rising to 1.3m in 2030-31.</p>

            <p>Breathing Space will provide strong protections for people in problem debt. These protections will increase the incentive to take-up debt advice. It is uncertain by exactly how much this will increase demand for debt advice. Engagement with debt advice agencies suggested that a 10% annual increase in demand for debt advice was a central assumption. To account for a lag time in this demand increase while debtors become aware and convinced of the benefits of Breathing Space, it is forecast that marginal demand will be 5% of existing demand in 2021-22, rising to 10% per annum thereafter. This suggests that the marginal caseload – the number of people who will take-up debt advice under Breathing Space where they would not have done in the counterfactual – will be 66,000 in 2021-22 and 213,000 in 2030-31.</p>

            <p>Not all of the people who are incentivised to take-up debt advice under Breathing Space will be eligible to enter the scheme. In the low scenario, they will be as likely to be eligible for Breathing Space as people who seek debt advice in the counterfactual. In this scenario, 60% of the marginal caseload would be eligible for Breathing Space. In reality, it is likely that they will have a higher eligibility rate than this counterfactual population, by virtue of having self-selected into debt advice as a direct result of the existence of Breathing Space. In the absence of outturn data to inform an alternative assumption, it is assumed that the eligibility rate of this population will be 80%: the midpoint of the minimum (60%) and maximum (100%) eligibility rates. This reduces the size of the marginal caseload who enter Breathing Space to 53,000 in 2021-22, rising to 170,000 in 2030-31.</p>

Specifically, the 5% baseline annual increase in counterfactual debt advice demand (paragraph 6.7); the 60% eligibility rate (paragraph 8.2); the 10% increase in marginal debt advice demand (paragraph 8.3), and the 80% eligibility rate (paragraph 8.4), are uncertain.

            <p>In the counterfactual, debt advice agencies suggested that around 3% of those who seek debt advice take out new credit and fall behind on their ongoing liabilities two months after seeking advice. In some of these cases, that new credit will be worth over £500 and the failure to meet ongoing liabilities could be considered a choice rather than purely a product of the debtor’s financial position. In the absence of evidence to inform an assumption, it is assumed that this proportion would be 50%, so that 1.5% of counterfactual debt advice recipients deliberately stop paying their ongoing liabilities and take out further credit having sought debt advice. Debt advisers suggested that, additionally, 15% to 20% of debt advice recipients fail to continue to engage with debt advice.</p>

            <p>A macroeconomic deterioration could increase demand for debt advice and so take-up of Breathing Space. Likewise, a period of sustained economic growth could reduce demand for debt advice. Given the inherent uncertainty and in the interests of proportionality, this take-up forecast makes no assumption about macroeconomic change.</p>

            <p><i>Transforming Lives </i>is an impact evaluation conducted for StepChange by Baker Tilly. A review of the social impact of debt advice for UK individuals and families, the report uses a social return on investment methodology to identify the economic value of debt advice delivered between 2012 and 2013 to 109,397 debt advice clients. The report identifies a wide variety of areas where debt advice has delivered a societal benefit. These benefits include: increased employment, improved mental health, higher creditor recovery, reduced desperation crime, reduced debt recycling, reduced risk of children being taken into care, reduced rates of eviction, improved interpersonal relationships, increased small business survival, and higher parental engagement, amongst others.</p>

            <p>Building on this research, Europe Economics explored <i>The Economic Value of Debt Advice </i>for the Money Advice Service. This research used a regression model to identify whether a treatment group who undertook debt advice experienced different outcomes to a control group who did not. The specific outcomes that this research examined were those where Baker Tilly identified an impact amongst StepChange clients. To mitigate the risk of sample-selection bias, Propensity Score Matching was employed.</p>

These are: debtors who receive advice in the counterfactual, who will engage more effectively with advice under Breathing Space; debtors who take-up advice under Breathing Space that they would not have taken up in the counterfactual, and people who enter Breathing Space via the Mental Health Alternative Access Mechanism, who would not have received advice in the counterfactual. These caseloads are summarised in table 3 below. Year 1 is 2021-22 and year 10 is 2030-31.</p>

This productivity benefit to employers has been adjusted to reflect the fact that not all people in problem debt are in employment. A survey conducted by YouGov for Europe Economics suggested that the employment rate of people in problem debt was between 50% and 55%. In 2021 prices, this equated to a benefit of £1,969 at a 55% employment rate, or</p>

            <p>All three cohorts will benefit. The cohort who already receive debt advice in the counterfactual will benefit by the marginal benefit of debt advice under Breathing Space. The Mental Health Access Mechanism and new debt advice cohorts will benefit from the full value of debt advice. This benefit has no impact on business. The size of this impact is quantified in table 6 below.</p>

            <p>It is possible that people in the Mental Health Access Mechanism cohort will see greater improvements to their wellbeing and reductions in mental health problems than the other cohorts, given they are a cohort explicitly suffering from the intersection of both problem debt and mental health crisis. However, primary research was not available to support or quantify this possibility.</p>

            <p>People in problem debt who seek debt advice repay more to their creditors. Under Breathing Space, this benefit will be more pronounced. The creditor behaviour that causes people in problem debt either to enter inappropriate debt solutions or to disengage with debt advice will be prohibited under Breathing Space. As a result, fewer debtors will enter the most readily accessible debt solution rather than the most appropriate, and fewer debtors will disengage with debt advice under the strain of impending enforcement action and spiralling debts before they manage to find a debt solution.</p>

            <p>Not all debtors who receive debt advice will enter debt solutions. Longitudinal research conducted for the Money and Pensions Service suggests that 84% of people in problem debt who agree to undertake an action following debt advice subsequently undertake that action. As only people in problem debt who have a realistic chance of entering a debt solution are eligible for Breathing Space, it is reasonable to assume that all debtors who enter Breathing Space will be advised to enter some form of debt solution. MAPS’ finding suggests that 84% will subsequently enter that solution, while 16% will not.</p>

As described in paragraph 7.10, both figures are uplifted by 14% to reflect the enhanced value of debt advice under Breathing Space. This yields a benefit to creditors of</p>

            <p>As in the calculations for the other benefits of Breathing Space, the full and marginal benefits of Breathing Space are applied in respect of the relevant caseloads. In this instance, the benefit to debtors who do not take up debt advice in the counterfactual is £4,015 for debtors who enter solutions (C) and £979 for those who do not (D). In respect of debtors who do receive debt advice in the counterfactual, the relevant marginal figures – £493 (A) and £121 (B) – are applied. Applying these unit benefits to the relevant caseloads yields the benefits summarised in table 8 below.</p>

            <p>Some debtors will take up debt advice under Breathing Space that they would not have taken up in the counterfactual. All of this group are forecast to repay more to their creditors than they would have done in the counterfactual. It is assumed that the proportion of this cohort who will enter debt solutions is the same as that of people who seek advice in the counterfactual. As this benefit depends upon a behavioural change, it is not inevitable and is therefore considered indirect. This benefit is expressed in the first row of table 8.</p>

          <content>
            <p>Creditors are also expected to benefit from higher repayments from debtors who were already engaging with debt advice. Within this cohort, the behaviour of some creditors in the counterfactual provoked some debtors either to disengage with debt advice or to enter a sub- optimal debt solution. This creditor behaviour – applying the pressure of impending or actual enforcement action while allowing debts to spiral through the addition of interest and charges – will be prohibited under Breathing Space. As a result, debtors will continue along their existing pathways: having sought advice, they will enter debt solutions and so repay their creditors more than they would have done otherwise. This benefit will not be an immediate and inevitable consequence of the policy; it will depend on behavioural change on the part of creditors. It is therefore considered to be indirect.</p>

            <p>This represents a conservative assessment of the likely benefits of Breathing Space. In addition to the benefits of debt advice that are monetised in the secondary sources, there are a wider set of benefits that are identified in the secondary source material but that are not monetised. These include lower dependence on state-subsidised housing; more positive education and employment outcomes, partly as a result of higher levels of parental engagement; lower risk of children being taken into care; lower rates of desperation crime; lower risk of eviction or repossession; lower risk of job loss; lower rates of relationship breakdown; increased social security take-up; higher rates of small business continuity, and more positive future credit access.</p>

              <p>Enforcement action will be paused during Breathing Space. Some debtors will change their repayment behaviour as a result, choosing not to make debt repayments that they would have made in the counterfactual. In addition, revenue that might have been generated by enforcement action will be delayed until the end of Breathing Space, when enforcement action may continue. This will generate indirect costs to creditors who have borrowed to lend.</p>

Their ongoing liabilities repayment behaviour should not, therefore, change. However, debtors will have the discretion to alter their repayment behaviour for their accrued debt or arrears, where enforcement action is prohibited for non-repayment.</p>

Data to inform an assumption on the size of this caseload was not available, so it is assumed that the same proportion would change their behaviour against the advice of their debt adviser as would change it on their debt adviser’s advice. 1.2% of the Breathing Space caseload is therefore assumed to change their debt repayment behaviour to stop repaying these debts.</p>

            <p>This suggests that £29m will be delayed in 2021-22, rising to £51m in 2030-31 as the Breathing Space caseload grows. The cost to creditors of this delay will be only a fraction of the delayed revenue. The money that creditors lend could derive from a variety of sources. In the interest of proportionality, it is assumed that all creditors borrow the capital that they lend. The cost of delayed revenue will therefore be equivalent to the cost to creditors of maintaining a leveraged position. In addition, there will be an opportunity cost for creditors, but this is not monetised.</p>

            <p>The first step in quantifying the amount of interest that creditors will forego during Breathing Space is to quantify the principal that will fall within the protections of Breathing Space. The principal of debt falling within Breathing Space’s protections is taken to be the forecast caseload in each year multiplied by the proportion of debtors with each type of debt. These proportions are based on evidence shared by debt advice agencies on the existing debt composition of the debtors who seek advice in the counterfactual.</p>

            <p>The next step is to identify the average Annual Percentage Rate for each type of debt. In the case of credit card debt, the best available source is the Bank of England, which publishes monthly data.22 As at 30 June, this was 18.45%. Where such product-wide data is not available, and in the interests of proportionality, an indicative APR for each type of debt has been identified via open source credit comparison websites.</p>

            <p>Information on the specific repayment rates expected by creditors is market sensitive. In the absence of outturn data on repayment rates, an assumed repayment rate was derived from the proportion of debtors with a personal budget surplus after meeting their essential costs. Debt advisers estimated that 40% of their clients retained a budget surplus after meeting all of their ongoing liabilities. It is assumed that only debtors with a positive budget can meet their interest payments as they come due, such that the average repayment rate for interest payments across most debts is 40%.</p>

            <p>Debt advisers suggested that the repayment rate of high cost credit products is likely to be lower than those of other forms of credit. Data shared by debt advice providers suggested that debt advice clients with high cost credit products were 33% less likely to be able to handle their debts on their own without a debt solution, or after maximising their incomes, compared to other debt advice clients. It is therefore assumed that the repayment rate of high cost credit products is 33% lower than that of other credit products, at 27%.</p>

            <p>The amount of interest foregone is therefore expressed as the principal multiplied by the monthly interest rate, expressed to the power of the number of compounding intervals that fall within Breathing Space. This amount is then multiplied by the counterfactual repayment rate.</p>

            <p>As discussed in paragraph 15.1, the cost of lending will vary by creditor. All creditors will face opportunity costs where counterfactual revenue is delayed and leveraged creditors will face additional costs of borrowing to lend. This also applies to foregone interest, where debtors’ contractual interest liabilities will cover the risk taken by creditors, their profit margins, and the cost of servicing their own debts. For that reason, as in paragraph 15.14, the stock of interest foregone is multiplied by the assumed two-month cost of borrowing to lend, which is taken to be 0.49%. This increases the cost to creditors of interest foregone by £683,000 in 2021-22, rising to</p>

            <p>This process is repeated for each of the debt types identified by debt advice agencies to identify the total cost to creditors of foregone interest in each year of the assessment period. The inverse of this cost is considered to be a benefit to debtors, so foregone interest is treated as an economic transfer. As set out in paragraph 15.16, distributional weighting is not applied, so the benefit to debtors of freezing interest is likely to be understated.</p>

This increases the cost to creditors of charges foregone by £90,000 in 2021-22, rising to £159,000 by 2030-31. This cost is included in table 11.</p>

            <p>On average, debtors have numerous debts. Debt advisers consulted as part of this Impact Assessment suggested a range of between four and six debts per debtor. It may be that some debtors have multiple debts to the same creditor, in which case the creditor would be expected to incur administrative costs only once. However, no evidence was available on the extent to which debtors owe multiple debts to the same creditor, so this assessment assumes that all debts give rise to an administrative burden, rather than only a subset. This is likely to overstate the administrative costs of Breathing Space.</p>

            <p>The 30-day check will not be burdensome in the majority of cases. The debt adviser will have to confirm that the debtor has continued to engage in debt advice – information which should be readily available to them – and will only need to investigate whether a debtor has contravened other ongoing Breathing Space eligibility criteria where a creditor has proactively reported to them that this is the case. It is expected that the 30-day check will be administered in 10% of cases.</p>

The best available estimate was that systems changes would cost between £60,000 to £85,000. Given the uncertainty, only the upper estimate has been used in the calculations that follow. To account for the risk of cost escalation, the upper estimate of costs has been uplifted by 20% to account for optimism bias, leaving it at £102,000.</p>

            <p>Breathing Space will offer an alternative access mechanism for people receiving mental health crisis treatment. This group will be entered into the protections of Breathing Space by a debt adviser on the basis of an application which includes evidence from an Approved Mental Health Professional (AMHP) that the individual is receiving mental health crisis treatment.</p>

            <p>This will introduce a new burden on the time of AMHPs, at an administrative cost. This cost will be a factor of the average hourly earnings of AMHPs, the amount of time taken to enter a patient into Breathing Space and then remove them from it, and the number of patients who will enter the protections of Breathing Space via this avenue.</p>

            <p>The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) estimate that the average hourly wage of an AMHP is £20.16. This is an approximation, as AMHP remuneration varies geographically and is not set centrally. Uplifted by 20.6% to account for non-wage labour costs, the average hourly cost of AMHP time rises to £24.32.</p>

            <p>The specific form that will be used by AMHPs to enter patients into the protections of Breathing Space has not yet been developed. DHSC identified a suitable proxy form as Form A2 under Regulation 4(1)(a)(ii) of the Mental Health Act 1983. This form is used by AMHPs to admit a patient for assessment.24 DHSC estimated that it takes AMHPs 15 minutes to process this form.</p>

            <p>In addition to entering patients into the Breathing Space alternative access mechanism, mental health professionals will need to inform debt advisers when treatment ends so that the breathing space can come to an end. It is estimated that this will take half as long as processing the initial entry. This suggests a total time requirement of 22.5 minutes per patient entering the mechanism. Per patient, this suggests that the administrative cost to AMHPs will be 37.5% of an hour’s labour costs, which equates to an administrative cost of £9.12 per patient.</p>

            <p>The costs of undertaking this familiarisation activity will vary between small and micro firms and debt advice agencies and larger ones. Small and micro firms and debt advice agencies are expected to engage consultants to assist them in familiarising themselves with the legislation and guidance. Larger firms are expected to engage the services of in-house legal and compliance professionals. The mean hourly wages of in-house compliance staff are expected to be £22 per hour, while those of external consultants are expected to be £24 per hour.25 These wage costs are inflated by 20.6% to reflect non-wage labour costs. Small and micro firms and debt advice agencies are therefore expected to incur more significant familiarisation costs than larger ones. This is discussed in more detail in the small and micro business assessment</p>

This large firms figure is the sum of the 190 large consumer lenders, 60 large energy firms, and 25 large water firms. In addition, 909 large and small debt advice agencies are expected to familiarise themselves with the relevant regulations and guidance. In addition, a small number of large public-sector creditors, a small number of central government departments are expected to familiarise themselves with the relevant regulations and guidance. The costs for these bodies is assumed to be the same as for those of large creditors.</p>

            <p>Reading speed declines with text complexity. An assessment of the complexity of the Breathing Space regulations yields a Flesch-Kinkaid readability score that suggests a reading speed of 100 words per minute. The draft regulations are currently 7,352 words long. It is assumed that the as yet unwritten guidance accompanying the regulations will be as long as the original regulations. Taken together, this suggests a reading time of 2.45 hours. The familiarisation costs to creditors and debt advice agencies will therefore be £445,000 in 2021-22, with no ongoing costs. This cost is considered to be direct as it arises automatically: compliance will be statutory.</p>

Sector-level market concentration data is unavailable in the Business Population Estimates for this sector, but stakeholders consulted as part of this impact assessment suggested that the vast majority of borrowers engage with large creditors. FCA analysis suggests that 190 firms own 99% of outstanding consumer credit.27 Some of the further c.2,600 firms who own 1% of outstanding consumer credit may be SMBs, but data on the proportion of these firms who are SMBs was unavailable.</p>

Indeed, given SMBs’ lower capacity to absorb write-offs relative to larger firms, stakeholders suggested that SMBs might be less likely to see clients enter Breathing Space than larger businesses, where SMBs are voluntary creditors who choose which clients to issue with credit.

            <p>Debtors in the scheme will be required to continue to meet their ongoing liabilities, such as paying their rent. As explained in paragraph 15.8, only a minority of debtors are expected to stop making arrears repayments during Breathing Space, which is not intended to be a repayment holiday. As discussed in paragraph 15.1, the cost to creditors of delayed revenue will be a factor of the source of the money lent to debtors. In some cases, this will be the cost of borrowing to lend. If SMBs needed to access finance as a result of delayed revenue this will be, in some cases, at a higher borrowing rate than those that larger businesses will have access to. In the case of landlords and other involuntary creditors, this might arise where a landlord was forced to borrow as an opportunity cost of not receiving rent arrears payments that might have been made in the counterfactual. Conversely, people in Breathing Space will be offered specialist debt advice and support whilst on the scheme, which may help landlords recover some of the owing rent arrears.</p>

As at Thursday 1st August, the GBP LIBOR 12-month rate stood at 0.847%. Over two months, this rate is equivalent to a 0.14% interest rate. This rate is likely to be far below that accessible to SMBs. According to the Federation of Small Business’s quarterly <i>Voice of Small Business Index</i>, 53.1% of SMBs who borrowed in Q2 2019 did so at beneath 5% APR, or 0.83% over a two-month period.31</p>

As data to inform a specific assessment of the proportion of costs that will fall on SMBs was unavailable, a sensitivity analysis was applied: the cost of delayed revenue for all creditors in Breathing Space is assumed to be the average of 0.14% and 0.83%, which is 0.49%. This is likely to overstate the cost of delayed revenue as, in reality, the market share of SMBs in sectors affected by Breathing Space is likely to be very small, with the exception – as described above – of private landlords. For that reason, most creditors affected by Breathing Space will face lower delayed revenue costs than the level assumed by this sensitivity analysis.</p>

            <p>SMBs are likely to face higher familiarisation costs than larger businesses. As explained in section 21, SMBs are less likely to employ in-house legal and accounting professionals than larger firms. As a result, they are expected to familiarise themselves with Breathing Space by engaging external consultants. According to the Office for National Statistics, the mean hourly gross wage of workers engaged in management consultancy activities is £2 more per hour than that of workers engaged in legal and accounting activities.32 As a result, the expected cost of familiarisation is expected to be 8% higher for SMBs than for larger firms.</p>

            <p>Not all of the additional cost of engaging management consultants is attributable to their increased labour costs, so the true additional cost is likely to be higher than 8%. Quantifying the full additional cost would require data on the costs to SMBs of engaging the services of management consultants, rather than the management consultants’ hourly wage costs. This data is not available, but it is clear that SMB familiarisation costs will be higher than those of larger businesses.</p>

            <p>As discussed in section 20, firms are expected to make systems changes only where it is economical to do so. Whether or not this is the case will be a factor of the costs of complying with the policy manually via administrative workaround, which will be a product of the number of interventions required, which will in turn be a product of the number of people that each business sees enter Breathing Space. As discussed above, it was not possible to assess whether SMBs were more likely to see their clients enter Breathing Space than larger firms, though anecdotal evidence suggests that this is unlikely. For that reason, SMBs are not expected to face higher systems change costs than larger firms.</p>

            <p>Some firms may be forced to make systems changes not because doing so is more economical than complying with Breathing Space via administrative intervention, but because of their business models. For example, firms that depend upon a high level of automation might not be able to hire the staff required to make administrative changes without fundamentally restructuring. Data on the extent to which firms rely on automation was not available, so it has not been possible to assess the extent to which SMBs might be forced to make systems changes.</p>

            <p>The assessment above identified some disproportionate costs to SMBs. Although there is no evidence – save for in the housing sector – that SMBs will see more of their clients enter Breathing Space than larger firms, there is strong evidence that SMBs will face higher costs per debtor in Breathing Space than larger firms. For example, the costs to SMBs of delayed revenue and of familiarisation with the policy will be higher than those faced by larger businesses.</p>

            <p>For that reason, the government considered full exemption for SMBs. This would mean that debts owed to SMBs would not fall within the protections of Breathing Space. The government concluded that this would undermine the wider policy intent of incentivising people in problem debt to take-up debt advice and of promoting more positive debt advice outcomes, as it would not provide genuine respite from enforcement action and spiralling debts, particularly where debtors’ liabilities were mostly or entirely to creditors who were excluded from the protections of the scheme. This would mean that debtors with the same debt types and levels would be treated differently on the basis of the number of employees of their creditor. For debtors whose only debts were to SMBs, there would be no additional incentive to seek debt advice. For those undergoing enforcement action and continuing to accrue interest and charges on some of their debts, they would not have the headspace to identify and enter the most appropriate debt solution, rather than the most readily accessible.</p>

This would reduce the ongoing costs to SMB creditors, such as delayed revenue, but not the transitional costs of, for example, familiarisation.

However, evidence from Ofcom suggests that people aged over-65 may be less able to access debt advice via online or telephone channels than the general population. For example, people aged 65-74 are 15 percentage points less likely than the adult population to use a mobile phone, nine percentage points less likely to use a computer, and 16 percentage points less likely to use a tablet.35 To ensure that this inequality of access to debt advice delivered via telephone or online channels does not discriminate against those aged over-65, the government will make Breathing Space accessible via either telephone, online, or face-to-face debt advice channels.</p>

            <p>Breathing Space is accessible only via professional debt advice. The debt advice sector makes a variety of adaptations to ensure that advice is accessible to those with protected characteristics. For example, StepChange – a debt charity – has an advocacy team who provide additional practical support to vulnerable debt advice clients. This support is delivered in partnership with dedicated support organisations including Macmillan, Age UK, Dementia Friends, Mind, and Samaritans. It can involve offering supplementary debt advice sessions, referring debt advice clients to specialist third party organisations, and submitting debt write-off requests to creditors in certain circumstances - ensuring that people with protected characteristics have access to debt advice.</p>

In this extreme scenario, the Net Present Value of Breathing Space would be -£42m. The £1,802m residual benefit would be derived from debtors receiving mental health crisis treatment. This group will benefit from improved wellbeing and from economic transfers as a result of not being charged interest or fees and, for debtors who choose to alter their repayment behaviour, from retaining money that would otherwise have been paid to their creditors. This is considered to be the floor in the Net Present Value of Breathing Space, as there is a high degree of certainty that this group will enter the mental health crisis moratorium without altering their behaviour and that they will benefit to the same degree as debtors who receive debt advice in the counterfactual.</p>

            <p>The government will lay regulations on Breathing Space before the end of 2019, and then intends to implement the policy in early 2021. The intervening period is vital in ensuring that creditors and debt advisers are prepared to deliver breathing space from the outset.

Creditors will need some time to prepare to perform these actions, for example by making systems changes as accounted for in section 20.</p>

            <p>A key element in the success of breathing space will be the development of an IT portal that will record entries into Breathing Space, notifying creditors accordingly that they should initiate the protections of Breathing Space. The portal will be developed by the Insolvency Service and used by debt advisers. HM Treasury is working closely with the Insolvency Service to ensure that the portal meets the needs of creditors, and debt advisers, as well as recording some of the management information that will be required to evaluate the policy.</p>

            <p>The Breathing Space scheme consists of two parts: Breathing Space, which has been assessed here, and the Statutory Debt Repayment Plan (SDRP). The government intends to implement Breathing Space in early 2021, with the SDRP developed to a slower timeline. The SDRP will extend the protections of Breathing Space to debtors who commit to fully repaying their debts to a manageable timeline. Each part of the scheme will be evaluated separately. This will require the impact of each part of the scheme to be isolated, as there will be some overlap between the two parts. The phased implementation of the two parts of the scheme will allow the government to evaluate the impacts of Breathing Space alone and then the two parts of the scheme combined.</p>
