                <p class="ia-table-text">Annual reports provide shareholders and investors with information on a company’s financial and non-financial performance. Non-financial information comprises quantitative and qualitative data on the business’s operations and principal risks. The quality and quantity of non-financial reporting currently fails to adequately address the asymmetry of information that exists between companies and investors. Additionally there is no standard reporting framework across Europe to allow consistent comparison of companies. To address these issues a regulatory intervention at European level is necessary to set harmonised minimum non-financial reporting requirements. </p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">The policy objective is to enhance the effectiveness of non-financial reporting by ‘public interest entities’ (PIEs), which are companies whose activities are likely to have a significant impact on the economy and society (such as listed companies, banks and insurers). The changes to non-financial reporting requirements to increase transparency and accountability are intended to encourage companies to better assess non-financial risks, and opportunities and incorporate this into their business strategies and models. Dissemination of this in the Annual Report would increase transparency and help investors to make more informed investment decisions.</p>

          <p>Annual Reports are crucial information sources that shareholders and creditors need to understand how the companies in which they invest/may invest, and to whom they lend/may lend, are performing. One of the core strengths of the UK corporate governance system is the transparency that it affords to potential investors, and creditors and the power that shareholders and creditors have to challenge company directors. However, this challenge will only be effective if companies provide shareholders and creditors with high quality information on which to act. </p>

          <p>The term “non-financial” information refers to narrative information that adds, in part, depth and context to the financial information contained in the company accounts, published in the Annual Report.  In addition it describes how the directors of the company have considered the non-financial factors that affect the performance of the company. While the information provided to shareholders to demonstrate this consideration is unique to the company, it can be divided into broad categories. Using the classifications in the NFRD (, Table 1 below provides an overview of the type of information that may be provided. </p>

          <p>Alongside the importance of reporting per se, the second issue addressed here is the comparability of information that companies disclose. While there is much debate on companies being able to demonstrate their individuality via their reporting there can be a need for investors and creditors to be able to compare company performance in various areas. For example an investor interested in the long term sustainability of a company may be interested in comparing the environmental performance of various companies in a similar field. Similarly an investor investing in high energy intensive industries may be interested in what non-financial actions it has put in place to mitigate environmental and reputational risk.</p>

          <p>Over the years, national reporting frameworks have developed to address national needs. Some member states have implemented legislation which goes beyond the requirements of the NFRD. However, such requirements vary largely in terms of content or the type of companies producing a non-financial report. For example, in Denmark, companies are required to state whether they have a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) policy and, if they do, to describe its implementations and results, while in the UK quoted companies are required to disclose social and community matters where necessary for an understanding of the business including the gender of staff in senior positions in a quoted company. These divergences in legislative frameworks have led to difficulties for investors and analysts who are less able to benchmark or assess company performance across the EU. </p>

          <p>Currently, in the UK, only quoted companies (those that have listed equity traded on an EU regulated exchange) are subject to greater non-financial reporting requirements.

          <p>The underlying problem is that of information asymmetry between users of non-financial information and the directors of the company – with directors having access to a much greater amount, and quality, of non-financial information than shareholders, creditors and other external stakeholders (e.g. NGOs) in the company.

          <p>The NFRD, which largely mirrors the UK’s existing requirements on quoted companies, includes additional disclosures on anti-bribery and corruption matters and diversity policies.

      <level>
        <content>
          <p>There is evidence (detailed earlier in the IA) that companies have not been able to provide an appropriate response to users' need for non-financial transparency. The reason for such failure is to be found in the insufficient and uneven incentives provided by the market: on the one hand, the cost of transparency is certain, measurable and short term. Conversely, the benefits of enhanced transparency are often perceived as uncertain, long-term, or external to the company. </p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>For example companies may wish to reduce cost by not investing in processes that monitor and mitigate anti-bribery and unethical behaviour by their suppliers and customers. They might perceive the risks to be small or they may place greater weight on the short term gains from a lower cost supplier, even if the risks of their involvement in bribery and corruption are higher. Where a company does have information on a high risk of bribery and corruption among suppliers or customers, it would have the disincentive to disclose it for fear of investor reaction to this information and the possible impact on their cost of capital.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Such asymmetry determines that companies do not always have sufficient incentives to disclose non-financial information – and that the overall level of non-financial disclosure is socially sub-optimal. One could assume that if companies’ non-financial impacts are not known to stakeholders, companies will have little incentive to adjust their behaviour and to take due account of non-financial externalities into their decision-making.</p>

          <p>The asymmetric information between those that manage the company and those that own it or trade with it can lead to sub-optimal investment and trading decisions as well as a misalignment of managers’ incentives away from delivering best performance for the company.</p>

          <p>The development of national reporting frameworks, to meet national needs, has led to the development of a fragmented framework at EU level. Some Member States have implemented legislation going far beyond the requirements of the current Accounting Directive in regards to non-financial reporting.  Others have already implemented reporting frameworks at national level; these frameworks have been developed to address national needs. </p>

        <content>
          <p>The variation across countries can increase the costs to preparers. In addition, given the plethora of voluntary agreements across EU member states and the differing quality of reporting that result, the fragmented framework presents difficulties to analysts and investors who are less able to benchmark companies. The introduction of a set of standardised legal requirements across Member States will help provide certainty to preparers as to the category of information required for the non-financial statement.  Investors and analysts will be able to compare company performance by using the information disclosed under these standard legal requirements.</p>

NFRD requirements would therefore be placed on PIEs with more than 500 employees, leaving the UK requirements as they are for those with fewer employees. This would result in a dual system among quoted companies i.e. quoted companies with less than 500 employees would report as they do currently and those with more than 500 employees would have to additionally meet the incremental changes brought in by the NFRD.</p>

          <p>Based on FAME data 389 quoted companies (49% of the total) have more than 500 employees, which are in scope of the NFRD. These companies already meet the requirements of the UK Enhanced Strategic Report and therefore meet most of the NFRD requirements. They would be affected only by the incremental changes brought about by the NFRD to the current UK requirements on quoted companies. This includes providing information on anti-bribery and corruption matters and diversity policy. These companies would also be affected by the requirement to provide a reasoned explanation for the omission of information on specified matters (such as diversity) – rather than just stating that it is not provided. Evidence from the consultation and post-consultation meetings with stakeholders suggested that these costs would be negligible but no estimates were assumed these would be negligible. Furthermore, we expect that at the present time companies concerned about the credibility of their reports would rarely state that they have omitted information without explaining why.</p>

This research is to be based on 400 computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) of companies including quoted and unquoted PIEs. It is currently in its fieldwork stage but we have been able to draw on the interim findings to inform this IA. The interim results of the survey were provided in June 2016 and cover 285 companies, 60 of which are quoted companies.</p></authorialNote>  The findings indicate that many large quoted companies are already reporting on anti-bribery and corruption matters and diversity matters (despite it not being a current requirement). 32 of the 38 large quoted company respondents (84%) said they already reported on anti-bribery and corruption matters. 27 of the 38 large quoted company respondents (71%) said they already reported on diversity issues. The percentage of companies that would incur additional costs of reporting these matters is therefore 16% and 29% respectively. We apply these percentages to the population of 389 to get our best estimate of companies (and their associated subsidiaries) that would incur further costs from the NFRD changes. The 95% confidence interval for the best estimates of percentages already reporting on anti-bribery and diversity are +/- 11.1% and +/-13.7% respectively. We use these as the lower and upper estimates of the percentage of the population that would incur additional costs.</p>

          <p>Of the unquoted PIEs, 148 (14%) have more than 500 employees. These are in scope of the NFRD. These companies do not currently meet the requirements of the UK Enhanced Strategic Report and therefore would experience a greater impact of the changes brought about by the EU NFRD. They would incur the costs of reporting on environmental matters, employee matters and human rights matters, as well as having to use Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), which only quoted companies in the UK have done so far. They would also have to report on anti-bribery and corruption matters. As the reporting on diversity policy only apples to quoted companies under the NFRD, unquoted PIEs would not be affected by this requirement. </p>

The percentage of companies that would incur additional costs of reporting this matter is therefore 63%. We apply this percentage to the population of 148 PIEs in scope to get our best estimate of companies (and their subsidiaries) that would incur further costs from this requirement.

We found that 50% of these reported on anti-bribery and corruption matters and 77% reported on diversity matters. The 95% confidence intervals for these estimates are +/-17.2% and +/-14.5% respectively. We use this to get lower and upper estimates of the percentage of the population that would incur the additional costs.

          <p>Recent studies indicate that investors increasingly incorporate risks relating to environmental social and governance (ESG) matters into their decisions. A global institutional investor survey (done by EY in 2015) shows evidence of a growing reliance on non-financial information. Investors are using nonfinancial performance to draw conclusions on value to inform and underpin their decisions.<authorialNote marker="28"><p> http://www.ey.com/GL/en/Services/Specialty-Services/Climate-Change-and-Sustainability-Services/EY-tomorrows-investment-rules-2</p></authorialNote> Investors would have such information from a wider range of companies under the NFRD.</p>

          <p>The NFRD would benefit investors’ decisions by adding the requirement to report on anti-bribery matters, which is an important governance issue. The Principles of Responsible Investment (PRI), which is a global body of investors undertook a three year project with companies, across a range of countries and sectors to, among other things, voluntarily encourage disclosure on anti-corruption matters in line with international reporting frameworks. The intention was to ‘enable investors to better assess and manage their exposure to the financial, operational and reputational impacts of corruption risks in their portfolios’.<authorialNote marker="29"><p> https://www.unpri.org/news</p></authorialNote> The PRI also provides guidance and practical advice for investors and companies on anti-bribery and corruption matters – indicating the importance of this matter to investors. The NFRD would make reporting on this matter compulsory among large PIEs in the UK (those with more than 500 employees).</p>

          <p>Of the 13 that said they would not use the information, some respondents commented that they will not use these data as the existing report structure in the UK already provides adequate information. Others commented that this information will be very unlikely to affect the investment case for buying shares in the companies and other investment decisions. One investor commented that information required by the NFRD will only increase costs for companies for negligible benefits and two others suggested it would not result in meaningful information (as for instance, companies involved in paying certain commissions will hardly admit bribery and corruption). </p>

As for benefits, 1 investor does not expect any, 1 investor is expecting better informed investment strategies, one improved monitoring of company activity, 1 more informed discussion at the AGM, 1 more informed voting at the AGM and no one suggested increased awareness of company activities.

          <p>NGOs use non-financial data to monitor company activity/behaviour and to increase engagement with companies. The increased transparency of non-financial information will benefit specific stakeholder groups such as NGOs and other civil society organisations. NGOs with a range of different missions will be expected to benefit - those concerned with the environment (e.g. Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth); and NGOs active in the field of human rights (e.g. Amnesty International and SHIFT). In addition the information on employees and diversity will be of interest to Trade Unions. </p>

          <p>Evidence gathered for the consultation stage IA included survey responses from two NGOs both of which said that they anticipate using the data that will be made available under the new requirements. Both organisations planned to use the data to monitor company activity. In addition to that, one will use it to inform campaigns and another to inform engagement with businesses to tackle problems identified. Both organisations think that the new requirements will increase engagement with companies and will lead to better informed campaigns. One of these organisations envisages improved monitoring of company behaviours. One estimated £500 per annum benefits as a result of increased engagement with companies, £1000 per annum benefits as a result of better informed campaigns and £1,000 per annum benefits thanks to improved monitoring of company behaviours. This organisation explained that it calculated the benefits assuming that staff time will be saved because information that previously required time and effort to uncover will now be reported routinely. The benefits have been assessed as relatively small as they do not have corporate focussed campaigns planned at present, they perceive loopholes in the legislation, and important information still will not be published, whilst recognising that it is a worthwhile improvement on previous legislation.  We treat this NGO’s estimates as indicative rather than precise – and therefore we do not extrapolate them in order to quantify the potential benefits arising from the option to the wider population of NGOs.</p>

One NGO stated that ‘There are clear advantages to investors, businesses, employees and broader society if senior managers within a company have a better understanding of its activities, impacts and risks in relation to environmental, social and employee matters, respect for human rights, anti-corruption and bribery matters, and the outcomes of its policies for these areas.’ This view was reiterated at our stakeholder meetings. </p>

          <p>By focusing on policies, including risks and opportunities, companies will be more likely to integrate non-financial risks into their strategies and business models.

The research is to be based on 400 computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) of companies including quoted and unquoted PIEs. It is currently in its fieldwork stage but we have been able to draw on the interim findings to inform this IA.

          <p>Companies were asked about the costs incurred by them in complying with the existing NFR requirements placed on them under UK law.

          <p>We expect that companies affected will incur familiarisation and implementation costs in the first year.  To quantify these costs, we requested companies to estimate first year costs and subsequent year costs separately. Companies were asked to report the level of staff that would be involved in complying with the additional requirements and the time (in hours) that would be required. Annex A provides the calculations of the costs per quoted company based on survey responses. Annex B shows the costs to unquoted companies. Throughout the Impact Assessment (IA), staff time costs are estimated based on hourly pay provided by the 2015 Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings. This is further explained in Annex G.</p>

          <p>We have been unable to estimate the costs to subsidiary firms from this survey, as information from the few subsidiary respondents was not useable without further clarifications and had to be disregarded. As subsidiary companies would not have to produce reports, the changes would impose a relatively minor change in the flow of information from subsidiaries to their parent companies. Estimates produced in the Consultation Stage IA indicated that the costs would be low. However, these estimates were also based on just two responses and implied a cost of just £2.31 - £3.36 per subsidiary per annum, which we don’t consider to be representative.</p>

          <p>Option 2: Many consultation respondents believed that this option is too complex as it would introduce a separate set of requirements for certain companies, some of which might switch between being a “large PIE” and a normal “quoted company” between years. This would mean that companies that move between categories would have to comply with two different complex frameworks across two different years. It was suggested that this would be administratively burdensome and costly. However, it is deemed impossible to quantify these costs. This option also reduces the level of comparability across years and across listed companies. However, some UK companies may consider that it would be in their interests to report voluntarily under the harmonised EU framework which provides more detail in relation to each matter subject to disclosure.  Voluntary reporting under the EU framework might also enable companies to avoid the costs and complexities of moving between reporting obligations during their lifecycle as their size (in financial terms and/or number of staff) increases or decreases year to year.  BEIS intends to legislate to permit companies to do this.  </p>

          <p>Option 3: This option would retain a single reporting framework for all quoted companies as is currently in the UK. There would, however, be an element of complexity introduced into the reporting framework of unquoted companies that are PIEs – as those with more than 500 employees would now have to meet the reporting standards of the NFRD. The non-monetised costs are expected to smaller than Option 2.</p>

          <p>The main aim of the policy is to require companies to prepare: information demonstrating their consideration of the impacts of their business operations, including their policies; an assessment of the risks and opportunities to the business; and an assessment of the outcomes of these policies. It is important to mention that the primary requirements of this policy focus on the provision of information to various groups with which the company may have contact. The benefits of this policy will only be realised should these groups choose to read and act upon the information provided by the company in this yearly non-financial statement.</p>

There are benefits in preparing non-financial information and indeed many companies already report on the new requirements voluntarily.

          <p>In line with the Better Regulation Framework Manual, we are not required to conduct a SaMBA because the measure is European in origin. No small or micro parent companies were identified as being in scope of the policy under the preferred option. We have not been able to calculate the size of subsidiaries of the companies who will be affected by the options. It is possible that some subsidiaries may count as small businesses. These would incur smaller costs of transferring information to their parent companies. The costs incurred by individual subsidiaries are also likely to vary in proportion to their size, so smaller companies would incur smaller costs. Any potential costs to these businesses are considered acceptable, to gain the benefits of better non-financial disclosure by their parent companies.</p>

          <p>The preferred option (Option 2) implements the EU NFRD’s minimum requirements – and therefore has no impact on the UK Government’s BIT. It has unquantified costs as it would reduce the comparability between reports of quoted companies within the UK. The costs are out of scope therefore there is no impact on the BIT target. It has not been possible to quantify the benefits of the new requirements.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Option 3, which goes beyond the EU minimum requirements (i.e. ‘gold-plates’ them), by extending the requirements of the Directive to smaller quoted companies has additional costs of £200,000 a year. It has additional non-monetised benefits to those of Option 2 (which arise from reporting by smaller quoted companies on anti-bribery and corruption and maintaining one framework of requirements across all quoted companies in the UK). Option 3 has an estimated EANDCB of £0.2m that is in scope of the BIT and contributes £1m of regulatory costs to the BIT over the Parliament.</p>
        </content>
      </level>
      <level>
        <content>
          <p>Option 4 is deregulatory as it reduces current reporting requirements on smaller quoted companies in the UK. It would result in equivalent annual savings to small quoted companies of £1.7m. The BIT score is £-8.5m. However, it would reduce the scope of existing UK reporting requirements and lead to a reduction in company disclosure in the UK. The intention of the NFRD is to raise and harmonise reporting standards across the EU. UK disclosure of non-financial information is amongst the best in the world and an area where it is government policy to demonstrate leadership. Reducing existing non-financial reporting requirements for listed companies would be therefore not be desirable.  Only a small minority of stakeholders supported this option in the Government consultation conducted in February 2016. Our view is that the any opportunity for deregulation of existing UK reporting requirements should be considered separately as the NFRD approaches its date for review and in the light of the UK’s future relationship with the EU. </p>

          <p>We have quantified costs for all PIEs affected by the options using responses to a survey that is part of an ongoing research project into the effects non-financial reporting had on company behaviour<authorialNote marker="41"><p> The Impact of Non-Financial Reporting, IFF-Belmana survey interim results, commissioned by the Department for Energy and Industrial Strategy in 2016.</p></authorialNote>. The research is to be based on 400 computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) of companies including quoted and unquoted PIEs. It is currently in its fieldwork stage but we have been able to draw on the interim findings to inform this IA. Our estimates are based on the interim results of the survey, which were provided in June 2016 and cover 285 companies, 60 of which are quoted companies and 38 of these had more than 500 employees.</p>

          <p><b>Costs in the first year: </b>We asked quoted companies about the total costs in the first year (i.e. to include familiarisation costs). These were reported only by companies not already reporting on the additional matters. The calculations are provided in Tables A1 and A3.</p>

          <p><b>Subsequent year costs</b> were reported by quoted companies who already report on the matter (and therefore were an estimate of costs they already incur) as well as quoted companies who do not report on the matter (and therefore predicted costs they would incur if the requirement was placed on them). We took the mean of these two reported averages to arrive at our best estimate of costs to reporting companies in subsequent years. The calculations are provided in Tables A2 and A4.</p>

          <p>We have quantified costs for all PIEs affected by the options using responses to a survey that is part of the aforementioned ongoing research project into the effects non-financial reporting had on company behaviour<authorialNote marker="42"><p> The Impact of Non-Financial Reporting, IFF-Belmana survey interim results, commissioned by the Department for Energy and Industrial Strategy in 2016.</p></authorialNote>. The research is to be based on 400 computer assisted telephone interviews (CATI) of companies including quoted and unquoted PIEs. It is currently in its fieldwork stage but we have been able to draw on the interim findings to inform this IA. Our estimates are based on the interim results of the survey, which were provided in June 2016 and cover 285 companies. Respondents also included 16 unquoted PIEs with more than 500 employees. </p>

          <p>For unquoted companies, we also had to estimate the <b>costs of meeting other requirements</b> of the EU NFRD which mirror the requirements of the UK’s Enhanced Strategic Report, but which are not currently met by unquoted companies. We estimate the ongoing costs of the change as the difference between the average costs of companies already meeting the requirements and the costs to unquoted companies meeting the current requirements on them. This is shown in Table B4.</p>

          <p>Our survey requested companies to report the total ongoing costs of the current NFR reporting requirements on them, which we use above. However, unquoted companies are expected to have additional familiarisation time imposed on them from this change. We assume that the incremental familiarisation time costs to them of meeting additional requirements would be similar to that estimated for the new requirement to report on anti-bribery and corruption matters. Under the NFRD they would also have to report on 3 additional matters - environmental matters, employee matters and human rights matters. We estimate the familiarisation time as the difference between the first year and subsequent year costs reported by them from the requirement to make an anti-bribery and corruption statement, multiplied by 3. The calculations are shown in Table B3.</p>

          <p>We have been unable to estimate the costs to subsidiary firms from this survey, as information from the few subsidiary respondents was not useable without further clarifications and had to be disregarded. As subsidiary companies would not have to produce reports, the changes would impose a relatively minor change in the flow of information from subsidiaries to their parent companies. Estimates produced in the Consultation Stage IA indicated that the costs would be low. However, these estimates were also based on just two responses and implied a cost of just £2.31 - £3.36 per subsidiary per annum, which we don’t consider to be representative. </p>

          <p>We therefore base cost estimates for subsidiaries on the current survey evidence – but on the assumption that these would be a percentage of the costs to their parent companies. We take 50% and 100% of costs to parents as the lower and upper bounds and use 50% as our best estimate. </p>

          <p>This would also create savings for the subsidiaries of these companies. As with costs, we assume that savings to subsidiary firms would be a percentage of the savings to their parent reporting companies. We use the estimate of savings for reporting companies in Table F1 above to calculate best, low and high estimates of the savings to their subsidiaries. These are shown in Table F3 below.</p>

          <p>We estimate that 411 quoted reporting companies have less than 500 employees and would fall in this category. We further estimate that these have 486 active trading subsidiaries between them. The total savings across all companies affected are shown in Table F4.</p>

          <p>During consultations with stakeholders on the recently implemented Audit Directive it was pointed out to us that the median wage rate underestimated the cost of staff time in the case of large PIEs. To reflect this we have used hourly wage costs of the relevant Standard Occupational Classifications (SOCs) in the 75th percentile of the ASHE data. Table G1 below outlines the hourly wage rates deployed in the IA before and after being uplifted for non-wage labour costs.</p>
