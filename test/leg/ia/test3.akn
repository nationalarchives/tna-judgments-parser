It is ordered at a flat rate on all fines, and this rate has not been changed since 2007 despite inflation. It is both right and important that offenders contribute more to the cost of supporting victims.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">It is a priority of the Government that offenders bear a greater proportion of the costs incurred by the state in supporting victims of crime. The proposed increase and extension of the Victim Surcharge as well as increasing Penalty Notices for Disorder (PNDs) will ensure a greater percentage of offenders contribute to the cost of support services.  Extending to in court disposals other than fines will make the application of the Victim Surcharge more equitable across offenders.</p>

                <p class="ia-table-text">The timings of the impacts of the reforms, particularly those relating to custody, are uncertain.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">The impact on victims is sensitive to the payment rate and the number of offenders given community sentences. <b>We assume the payment rate for the Surcharge 70% for those given conditional discharges and fines, 60% for those given community sentences and suspended sentences and 40% for those sentenced to immediate custody. We assume a payment rate of 54% for PNDs. These are all highly uncertain</b>. The rate for immediate custody depends in part on the extent to which money can be collected from offenders in prison.  We also assume the number of offenders given the relevant disposals remains at 2011 levels. They could vary, including if the Surcharge has a deterrent effect. The lower estimate is based on 20% optimism bias. We assume the reform relating to PNDs has an impact as soon as it is implemented, that reforms relating to conditional discharges, fines, adult community sentences, and suspended sentences and juveniles take 6 – 18 months to have their full impact, and the reform relating to custodial sentences takes 30 months for Crown Court sentences and 18 months for magistrates court sentences.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">The cost to the CPS and other prosecutors is sensitive to the impact of the Surcharge on the amount of costs ordered by sentencers and on the proportion of offenders who comply with their cost orders. It is also sensitive to the response of HMCTS to any increase in non-compliance.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">The impact on fine revenue to the MoJ and HM Treasury is sensitive to the effect of a larger Surcharge on compliance with fines. It is also sensitive to the response of HMCTS to any increase in non-compliance.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">The impact on PND revenue to HM Treasury is sensitive to the impact of an increase in PNDs on the payment rate.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">The impact on MoJ (HMCTS) depends on the proportion of offenders who comply an order to pay the Surcharge, and the impact of the Surcharge on the proportion of offenders who comply with a fine or cost order. It also depends on resourcing decisions. There will only be a direct cost if additional resources are put into enforcement as a result.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">The impact of the reforms relating to custody are also sensitive to the implementation of the Prisoners’ Earning Act 1996 (PEA) and the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 to deduct earnings from a wider group of prisoners than those that could be covered by the PEA. These may leave offenders in custody less able to pay any Surcharge.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">The impacts of all the reforms are sensitive to any independent changes in enforcement practices by HMCTS.</p>
                <p class="ia-table-text">The impacts of all the reforms except the increase in PNDs are sensitive to independent changes in the use of compensation orders by sentencers (as compensation takes priority over the Surcharge both at the point of sentence and for enforcement).</p>

            <p>This Impact Assessment considers reforms to extend the Surcharge to conditional discharges for adults; to increase the value of the Surcharge ordered on fines for adults; to extend the Surcharge to adult community sentences; to extend the Surcharge to custodial sentences for adults, including suspended sentences, and to use additional revenue from increased PNDs for the same purposes as the Surcharge.  It also considers the reforms to extend the Surcharge to juvenile offenders. </p>

            <p>Following a public consultation, the Domestic Violence, Crime and Victims Act 2004 amended the Criminal Justice Act 2003 by creating a duty for the courts to order a Surcharge when dealing with an offender.  It was implemented in April 2007 at a flat rate of £15 payable on all fines, including fines imposed on juvenile offenders.   The intention had always been to extend the Surcharge to other disposals including custodial sentences and community sentences, and to increase the value of penalty notices for disorder and fixed penalty notices, the additional revenue to be used to fund victims’ services. Proceeds from the Surcharge are ring-fenced to fund non-financial support services for victims and families.</p>

            <p>The current £15 Surcharge on fines has raised a total of £41.9million since it was introduced in 2007 and has funded Independent Domestic Violence Adviser Services, Witness Care Units, Victim Support Plus and the Victims’ Fund – which covers homicide, hate crime and sexual violence services. The Surcharge raised just over £3.8million in 2007/08, £8.1million in 2008/09, £9.2million in 2009/10, £10.5million in 2010/11 and £10.3 million in 2011/12.</p>

            <p>The conventional economic approach to government intervention to resolve a problem is based on efficiency or equity arguments. The Government may consider intervening if there are strong enough failures in the way markets operate (e.g. monopolies overcharging consumers) or if there are strong enough failures in existing government interventions (e.g. waste generated by misdirected rules). In both cases the reform itself should avoid creating a further set of disproportionate costs and distortions. The Government may also intervene for equity (fairness) and redistributional reasons (e.g. to reallocate goods and services to the more needy groups in society).</p>

            <p>The aim of the reforms is to improve fairness in two ways. The first is to distribute the considerable financial expense of providing support to victims of crime by increasing the contribution of offenders to the costs incurred by the state in supporting victims to cope and recover. Approximately £66m is spent by central government each year on victim and witness support services.  Offenders contribute only around £10m towards this total spend.</p>

          <num>6.</num>
          <content>
            <p>The second way of improving fairness is by ensuring more offenders pay a contribution towards the costs of supporting victims, with the level of contribution through the Surcharge being more proportionate to the seriousness of the sentence imposed by the court.  Currently only offenders ordered by a court to pay a fine are ordered to pay the Victim Surcharge. Extending the range of in-court disposals on which the Surcharge would be payable, through which offenders contribute to victims’ services, at a value which is more proportionate to the sentence, will make for a fairer system.  Under our reforms individuals issued with a PND (an out of court disposal) would contribute less than offenders given a conditional discharge, who in turn would contribute less than offenders fined in court, the majority of whom would contribute less than offenders given adult community sentences.  Offenders subject to custodial sentences would contribute in proportion to the length of sentence handed down. This approach will allow the comparative seriousness of the sentence to be reflected in the amount of the Surcharge which a person is ordered to pay. (Note that when multiple sentences are imposed in respect of one offence, the Surcharge would only be payable on the sentence attracting the highest surcharge.)</p>

            <p>This is not a straightforward equity argument, since typically we do not place value on offender welfare when assessing impacts.  Rather, it is based on the idea that members of society value having a justice system that delivers appropriate and proportionate penalties. At present conditional discharges, which are a less serious sentence than a fine, are not subject to the Surcharge. Fines are generally imposed for less serious offences than community sentences (which can only be imposed for offences for which a custodial sentence is available in statute) and smaller fines imposed for less serious offences than larger ones. Custodial sentences are imposed for the most serious offences.  The current arrangements, under which the Surcharge is ordered at a flat rate on fines and is not applied at all to community sentences or custodial sentences may therefore be seen as “unjust”.</p>

The costs and benefits of the reforms are compared to the base case (“do nothing” scenario).  Impact Assessments place a strong emphasis on valuing the costs and benefits in monetary terms (including estimating the value of goods and services that are not traded). However there are important aspects that cannot sensibly be monetised. These might include how the reform impacts differently on particular groups of society or changes in equity and fairness, either positive or negative. </p>

          <p>There may be a cost to the CPS (and other prosecutors). The Surcharge takes priority over costs both at the point of sentence and in the application of payments received from the offender. The Surcharge may inhibit courts from ordering costs against the offender at all, and when they do, these might be at a lower level. The extension of the Surcharge may therefore reduce the amount of costs imposed and due to the Surcharge taking priority over discharging cost orders when received in the court there may also be reduced costs paid to the CPS and other prosecutors.  Information on the value of cost orders imposed and discharged on those sentenced to conditional discharges is not available, so we are not able to estimate the likely scale of this impact.  </p>

          <p>The impacts of the reforms are sensitive to changes in crime rates and sentencing policies and patterns. We have assumed that the number of conditional discharges handed down remains at its 2011 level. However, changes to sentencing patterns may affect the number of conditional discharges. It is also possible that the Surcharge might have a deterrent effect. In addition, the demographic profile of those given Surcharges may change, which could affect the compliance and payment rates. Moreover, if the use of compensation orders for those given a conditional discharge increases, less revenue may be collected from the Surcharge (as compensation takes priority and the Surcharge may be reduced to zero if the Court considers the offender can’t afford both).</p>

            <p>Data on the payment rate for fines at present is limited - and the evidence we have indicates that it fluctuates. The ratio of the value of fines collected to the value of fines imposed was around 65% in 2009/10 and around 75% in 2010/11 and around 85% in 2011.<authorialNote marker="7"><p> Data is not yet available for the full financial year 2011/12.</p></authorialNote> These can only be treated as approximate payment rates as not all the fines collected in a year will have been imposed in that year. Given this, we assume a baseline payment rate of around 75%. In addition, it is possible that the increase in the Surcharge may have a deterrent effect. In order to estimate impacts we assume a payment rate of 70%. This may be conservative as the Surcharge takes priority over fines for collection. In addition, the Surcharge can only be reduced when compensation is also ordered and the offender is unable to pay both. The MoJ retains a proportion of fine revenue collected by HMCTS over a certain collection rate. Therefore to the extent that an increased Surcharge reduces the value of fines imposed and/or collected, the MoJ’s income will fall. We have no evidence to help us to predict the scale of these effects.</p>

The Surcharge may inhibit courts from ordering costs against the offender at all, and when they do, these might be at a lower level. An increase in the Surcharge amount may therefore reduce the amount of costs imposed and due to the Surcharge taking priority over discharging costs ordered by the court there may also be reduced costs paid to the CPS (and other prosecutors).

          <p>The reform will result in an increase in spending on services for victims. Based on the calculations above, our central estimate is that the reform will increase revenue for victims’ services by £5m (to the nearest £1m). As there is considerable general uncertainty around the impact of these reforms, we also calculate a lower estimate based on applying 20% optimism bias. Therefore, to the nearest £1m we estimate a range for the annual benefit to victims of £4m - £5m</p>

          <p>If the increase is perceived by the public as bringing the system closer to one in which offenders take responsibility and make greater financial reparation for their actions, there may be benefits in terms of fairness/public confidence in the justice system. Setting the Surcharge as a percentage of a fine aims to ensure that the level of contribution offenders make to the cost of supporting victims of crime is proportionate to the sentence.   Proposing that the Surcharge ordered on fines is subject to a £20 minimum and £120 maximum seeks to ensure fairness, by providing that the lowest available Surcharge on fines would be greater than that for a conditional discharge, but still keeping the maximum within the bounds of what is reasonable.</p>

In this case, only one Surcharge would be imposed – whichever is the larger of the Surcharge that would have been payable on the fine or the community order. This reform, therefore, could increase the Surcharge paid by those sentenced to fines. This could reduce the amount of fine revenue collected (either because sentencers imposed lower fines to (partially or fully) absorb the additional Surcharge, or because fewer of the fines imposed were collected by HMCTS.</p>

Information on the value of cost orders imposed and discharged is not collected, so we are not able to predict the likely scale of this impact.  </p>

          <p>The reform will result in an increase in spending on services for victims. We do not have direct information on the likely payment rate of a Surcharge on adult community sentences. We have some early, indicative evidence that suggests that offenders sentenced to community sentences may have lower means than those given fines.<authorialNote marker="9"><p> "Offending, employment and benefits - emerging findings from the data linkage project": <a href="http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/statistics-and-data/ad-hoc/index.htm"><u>http://www.justice.gov.uk/publications/statistics-and-data/ad-hoc/index.htm</u></a></p><p /></authorialNote>  However, HMCTS expect that a Surcharge on community sentences would be easier to collect than one on fines as offenders sentenced to community sentences are more likely to attend court, and so are easier to trace if enforcement is required. In light of these considerations, we assume a payment rate for a Surcharge on community sentences that is somewhat lower than that assumed for the Surcharge on fines: 60%. </p>

          <p> In 2011, 132,400 community sentences were handed down to offenders over 18. At a payment rate of 60%, we would expect this reform to increase revenue for victims’ services by about £5m (to the nearest £1m). As there is considerable general uncertainty around the impact of these reforms, we also calculate a lower estimate based on applying 20% optimism bias. To the nearest £1m, therefore, we estimate an annual benefit to victims of £4m - £5m.</p>

At present, the flat rate £15 Surcharge on fines would apply to those sentenced to custody and a fine. Under this reform the Surcharge that would apply to the custodial sentence may be larger than that that would apply to the fine. In this case, the Surcharge imposed would be the one that applies to the custodial sentence – so the Surcharge would be higher. Sentencers may reduce the amount of fine imposed to (fully or partially) absorb any increase in the Surcharge, or there may be a reduction in the payment rate for fines (as the Surcharge takes priority). Again, we are not able to estimate the scale of this impact. As the number of offenders likely to be affected is small, it is likely to be small. </p>

Implementation will be delayed for offenders sentenced to immediate custody in the magistrates’ court. Currently magistrates’ courts (but not the Crown Court) would have the power to add additional days to a sentence of immediate imprisonment in default of the Surcharge.

          <p>As set out in the Note on Timing above, the extension of the Surcharge to offenders sentenced to custody in the magistrates’ court will be implemented after the extension to the Crown Court (expected to be summer 2014 rather than October 2012). We assume that the behaviour of offenders in triable either way cases who currently elect to go to the Crown Court does not change during this transitional period, so the volume of offenders receiving custodial sentences in different courts does not change. If fewer offenders elected to go to the Crown Court, Surcharge revenue during the transition period might be lower. In addition, there could be temporary impacts on HMCTS, Legal Aid, the CPS and NOMS. We are not able to quantify these potential impacts, but they are outlined in the next paragraph.</p>

          <p>If more offenders were to choose to be tried in the magistrates’ court, there may be costs to the magistrates’ courts through a greater number of cases being dealt with there. There may also be savings in time to HMCTS as cases prosecuted through the magistrates’ court are shorter than Crown Court proceedings.  There are potential legal aid savings if more cases are paid at the rates for magistrates’ courts proceedings which are significantly lower than the rates paid for cases in the Crown Court. Similarly there may be savings to the CPS. The extent of any costs or savings depends not only on the behaviour of offenders but also on whether there is backfilling at the Crown Court (i.e. cases waiting to be heard are brought forward to replace any that move to the magistrates’ court). If there is complete backfilling, there will not be any savings, but other Crown Court cases will have been processed more quickly. Lastly, there may be differences between sentences handed down in the magistrates’ court and the Crown Court (within the magistrates’ court sentencing powers). The evidence is not unequivocal, but if there were to be an increase in sentence lengths for these offenders, there would be a cost to NOMS. Note that any impacts would be temporary</p>

          <p>Currently PND revenue is paid into the Consolidated Fund; therefore there may be a cost from reduced payment of PNDs if the increase reduces the payment rate. It is important to note that (unlike for court-ordered financial impositions) part payment of PNDs is not possible. Therefore, unlike fines, rather than losing up to the value of the Surcharge in other revenue, a shift from payment to non-payment would result in upfront revenue being reduced by the full £80 (or £50) value of the PND. Some PNDs that are no longer paid upfront may nevertheless be collected once they are registered as fines. This will depend on the enforcement response to any increase in PNDs being registered as fines. </p>

          <p>The reform will result in an increase in spending on services for victims. In 2011 121,300 PNDs were issued to over 18s and 54% of PNDs issued were paid in full. The average payment rate since 2005 has been 52%. At a payment rate of 54%, the reform would raise (to the nearest £0.5m) £0.5m for victims’ services.<authorialNote marker="12"><p> A 52% payment rate gives the same rounded estimate.</p></authorialNote>  If the payment rate fell as a result of the increase, revenue would be lower. As there is considerable general uncertainty around the impact of these reforms, we also calculate a lower estimate based on applying 20% optimism bias. To the nearest £0.5m, this has no effect on the annual estimated benefit, but it does affect the estimated 10 year present value of the benefits.</p>

          <p>In principle the net revenue impact could be negative, since where the increase results in an individual who would otherwise have paid their PND upfront not paying it, the loss of upfront revenue is £80 (or £50 for a lower-tier notice).

          <content>
            <p>The reforms to increase the Surcharge applied to fines is likely to impact upon businesses found guilty of criminal offences. Only quite a small number of fines are given to businesses each year. 6,900 fines were given to “other” offenders in 2011 – whereas ONS data shows there were 2.1m business registered for VAT and/or PAYE in March 2010<authorialNote marker="14"><p> http://www.statistics.gov.uk/cci/nugget.asp?id=1238</p></authorialNote>.

        <paragraph>
          <content>
            <p>The businesses affected will include small firms and sole traders. However, we do not have any evidence on the size of businesses given fines and so can’t be sure whether a disproportionate number of small businesses are likely to be affected compared to their representation in the private sector as a whole. </p>
          </content>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph>
          <content>
            <p>Whether setting the Surcharge at 10% of the fine, with a minimum of £20 and a £120 maximum Surcharge level is likely to have a larger impact on small businesses than large businesses depends on if small businesses tend to receive fines under or above £1200. If small businesses receive fines of under £1200, then they will not have their Surcharge capped. The proportionate increase in imposition could then be larger for small businesses. However, as mentioned above sentencers are expected to ensure the overall imposition is in line with the offender’s ability to pay.</p>

        <paragraph>
          <content>
            <p>We do not think it would be appropriate to exempt or adopt an alternative approach for small businesses. In order to be subject to the Surcharge a business needs to have committed an offence, and we do not think it appropriate to distinguish between offenders on grounds of whether they are a small business.  As noted above, these impacts are not counted in this Impact Assessment as they will only fall on businesses/individuals convicted of criminal offences or who are issued with a PND.</p>

            <p>There may be an impact on the income of offenders who are sentenced to fines as a result of them receiving a larger Surcharge when fined in court (at least £20, rather than £15 at present). However we do not expect a significant impact as the offender’s means are taken into account at the time of sentence.

            <p>Where an offender’s income makes payment of the Surcharge more difficult, HMCTS has a range of enforcement tools which may mitigate this impact. HMCTS would collect the Surcharge in the same manner as existing financial impositions awarded by a court. They have in place a number of payment methods that make it easy for offenders to pay financial impositions, these include payment cards and payment by credit and debit card both online and via a telephone payment line. These payment methods are actively promoted by enforcement teams and offenders are directed to the methods that are most appropriate and convenient for them. There are also payment methods which allow offenders, who are unable to pay in full at once, to pay financial impositions including the Surcharge over a period of time.  This includes deduction from benefits orders and attachment of earnings orders which allows the court to deduct payments for outstanding financial penalties from the offenders’ benefits or salary.  </p>
