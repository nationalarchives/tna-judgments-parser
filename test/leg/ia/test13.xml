                <p class="ia-table-text">There are 4.2 million informal carers across the UK, and this is likely to rise in the coming decades with the greater demand for care driven by an ageing society. This presents considerable challenges to carers, both in and out of employment. There is extensive evidence showing that informal care is associated with leaving employment, a reduction in hours worked and other employment effects such as taking on fewer senior roles, disruptions to working patterns and absenteeism. Studies over time have found women who started care work were more likely to stop their employment than women who did not start care work. Government intervention to provide a minimum statutory provision for carer’s leave would see societal benefits in carers being able to maintain their caring commitments, whilst maintaining their attachment to the labour market.  </p>

In addition, further benefits will flow from employee retention and employers will benefit from lower recruitment and training costs.

          <p>Whilst carers provide a vital support function in caring for individuals close to them, there is a wide body of evidence showing the negative impact of caring upon employment, as carers face difficulties in combining paid work with caring responsibilities. Informal carers are less likely to be in employment compared to all adults or non-carers and this is especially true for full-time employment. The FRS 2020/21 shows that 53% of all adult informal carers were in employment, </p>
        </intro>

            <p>compared to 59% of all adults. Adult Informal carers are also less likely to be in full-time employment (47%) compared to all adults (52%). Previous research by the OECD<authorialNote marker="7"><p> Francesca, Colombo, et al. <i>OECD health policy studies help wanted? Providing and paying for long-term care: providing and paying for longterm care</i>. Vol. 2011. OECD Publishing, 2011. </p></authorialNote> on the impact of caring across 35 countries found that caregiving resulted in reducing working hours in most countries. For the UK, the report found that care intensity, across all types of care (10 hours, 10-19 or 20 or more hours per week), was linked with a reduction in hours worked, albeit less so for carers providing fewer than 10 hours of care a week. One longitudinal study of the employment status of carers in England found that those who started caring for at least 10 hours per week in their fifties were significantly less likely to be in employment two years later compared to noncarers.<authorialNote marker="8"><p> King, Derek, and Linda Pickard.

"The chicken or the egg?: Endogeneity in labour market participation of informal carers in England." <i>Journal of health economics</i> 26.3 (2007): 536-559. </p></authorialNote>. Much of the literature on unpaid care suggests there is a threshold beyond which caring responsibilities adversely affect employment. The OECD study also found that for carers providing at least 20 hours of care per week that increasing hours of care by 1% resulted in carers being more likely to stop working by 10%.  </p>

          <p>Studies have predicted that 5% of UK adults have given up work to provide care for a relative or friend and 4% have reduced their working hours to provide care. This equates to 2.6 million people leaving the workforce. A recent Carers UK/YouGov poll highlighted that the impact of caring on work was highest amongst 45-54 year-olds, where more than 1 in 4 reported that caring had taken a toll on their work (27%)<authorialNote marker="10"><p> https://www.carersuk.org/for-professionals/policy/policy-library?task=download&amp;file=policy_file&amp;id=214 </p></authorialNote>. This is also the point at which people are most likely to have developed the skills employers need to succeed. As the population ages, and the number of carers rises, the effects of losing carers from the workforce will grow. This has important ramifications for public finances if carers feel they have no choice but to leave the labour market.  </p>

          <p>A UK study estimated public expenditure costs of carers leaving work in England to be approximately £2.9 billion per year, made up of £1.2 billion in tax revenue on lost earnings and approximately £1.7 billion on social security benefits now paid to carers who have left employment<authorialNote marker="11"><p> This is broken down as follows: £540m in Income Support, £780m in Housing Benefit, £360m in Carer’s Allowance </p></authorialNote>. In addition to this, companies such as Centrica have done internal analysis working out their financial savings from supporting their employees with a flexible carer policy and thereby increasing employee retention. Centrica then scaled this up and found that UK businesses could cumulatively save £4.8 billion a year in unplanned absences and a further £3.4 billion in improved employee retention<authorialNote marker="12"><p> http://www.carersuk.org/images/News_and_campaigns/Juggling_work_and_unpaid_care_report_final_0119_WEB.pdf </p></authorialNote>.

Working carers who are older are more likely to suffer a drop in income of at least £30k when they take on greater caring responsibilities, reflecting the fact that many carers aged 55-64 have skilled or senior-level jobs14. </p>

          <p>The combined effect of less income and higher costs of caring may lead to carers being more likely to suffer financial hardship than those without caring commitments. Research commissioned by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation examining poverty levels among carers between 2011/12 and 2013/14, estimated that 1.2 million carers were in poverty based on income after housing costs and excluding disability benefits<authorialNote marker="14"><p> https://www.npi.org.uk/files/2114/6411/1359/Carers_and_poverty_in_the_UK_-_full_report.pdf </p></authorialNote>. Overall, poverty rates were slightly higher for carers than non-carers but markedly higher for those providing more than 20 hours of care per week, highlighting how high-intensity carers are more likely to run into financial hardship than those with little or no caring commitments.  </p>

          <p>Carers may also see their own health and wellbeing suffer as they put the needs of others before their own. The 2011 census found that the general health of carers deteriorated with an increase in hours of care provided. For example, 5.2% of carers reported their own health as ‘not good’, rising to almost 16% for those caring for more than 50 hours per week. In a survey of unpaid carers across England<authorialNote marker="15"><p> Survey of Carers in Households, 2009/10 </p></authorialNote>, the most common effects of caring upon the carer’s health included feeling tired (34%) and stressed (29%). As expected, these results were more pronounced for those who spent more time caring per week. For those caring at least 20 hours per week, 47% reported feeling tired and 38% stressed. One study examining a cohort of informal carers across ten European countries over an eight-year period found that the provision of informal care was significantly linked with poor mental and physical health, even after accounting for socio-economic statuses such as age, education level and the health condition of the carer in earlier years.<authorialNote marker="16"><p> Hiel, Laura, et al.

There have been attempts to estimate the total cost of mental ill-health across the UK which some have estimated to be over £100 billion<authorialNote marker="17"><p> https://www.mentalhealth.org.uk/statistics/mental-health-statistics-global-and-nationwidecosts#:~:text=Cost%20of%20mental%20health%20problems%20in%20the%20UK,gross%20domestic%20product%20(GDP). </p><p> </p></authorialNote>. These costs fall into three different groups: direct spending on health care, spending on social security programmes, costs from lower labour market attachment and personal costs attributed to a lower quality of life. In giving carers the time and space to provide care, the stress and uncertainty arising from caregiving could be mitigated. This could ultimately improve the physical and mental health of carers.  </p>

          <p>Across the UK, there are various support services available to help carers balance their caring responsibilities and their employment. The right to request flexible working was first introduced in the UK in 2002. In 2014, the right was extended to all employees (beyond parents and carers), who have at least worked continuously for the same employer for the last 26 weeks. The Fourth WorkLife balance survey found that 48% of full-time carers worked flexibly, compared to 39% of noncarers.<authorialNote marker="18"><p> Tipping, Sarah, et al. "The fourth work-life balance employee survey." (2012). </p></authorialNote> There is some evidence to suggest that flexible working could help mitigate the negative impact of caring on employment and could lower the chances of reduced hours of work for carers in Australia and the UK<authorialNote marker="19"><p> Francesca, Colombo, et al. OECD health policy studies help wanted? Providing and paying for long-term care: providing and paying for longterm care. Vol. 2011. OECD Publishing, 2011. </p></authorialNote>. However, the literature also finds that some carers are wary of taking advantage of flexible working arrangements in fear of being thought as a ‘weak’ employee<authorialNote marker="20"><p> Arksey, Hilary, et al.

          <p>More generally the pandemic has transformed the way we work and has highlighted that flexible working arrangements can benefit employees without detriment to working environments and productivity. While flexible working might be useful to informal carers with lower care requirements, this may not be enough to help high intensity carers, who are more likely to drop out of the labour market entirely than work part-time<authorialNote marker="21"><p> Francesca, Colombo, et al. OECD health policy studies help wanted? Providing and paying for long-term care: providing and paying for longterm care. Vol. 2011. OECD Publishing, 2011. </p></authorialNote>. In addition to this, although flexible working arrangements provide greater flexibility to carers, they still are often based on fixed pre-arranged agreements with employers that do not account for certain unforeseen short-term changes in caring.   </p>

There is no limit on how much time off, or how many times emergency leave can be taken; this will typically be negotiated with the employer and one or two days is considered sufficient in most cases. Furthermore, the leave is designed for unforeseen circumstances such as death or illness and is not designed to be used be used for planned situations e.g., accompanying someone to a hospital appointment. It is also at the employer’s discretion whether to pay their staff when taking emergency leave. This therefore provides rationale for an additional entitlement to carers which will enable them take leave for planned situations.  </p>

          <p>Unpaid carers provide vital support to individuals close to them in need of care, and absence of their help would impose a large burden on the social care system. ONS analysis found that unpaid carers provide social care equivalent to £57 billion to the economy24.  Whilst many carers combine their caring and work commitments, it can be difficult to manage these at the same time and this is often at the detriment to the carer’s health wellbeing and employment outcomes. Within an ageing society, we can further expect more people to provide care to a family member or dependent for a longer period. Evidence predicts that by 2050 globally three times more people of working age will be looking after two billion ageing family members – and the majority will have to combine that care with paid work<authorialNote marker="23"><p> https://www.carersuk.org/for-professionals/policy/policy-library?task=download&amp;file=policy_file&amp;id=214 </p></authorialNote>.

Given the adverse impacts upon unpaid carers, it is likely that these problems will become more acute as the population ages, potentially causing more people to leave employment and increasing the burden of care on a shrinking workforce. </p>

          <p>There are existing provisions in statute to help deal with short term emergencies and longer-term care commitments in the form of time off for family and dependants<authorialNote marker="25"><p> https://www.gov.uk/time-off-for-dependants </p></authorialNote> and the right to request flexible working<authorialNote marker="26"><p> https://www.gov.uk/flexible-working </p></authorialNote>. However, in some cases these provisions may not be enough to help, for example, where the condition of the cared for person is deteriorating over time, or in cases where a short period away of work is needed for transitional events. Evidence shows whilst flexible working can help alleviate the burden of caring, this may not be enough to prevent carers from leaving the workforce all together. Therefore, the new entitlement will not duplicate existing provisions but instead seeks to build on existing rights, giving carers more flexibility in how they combine their work and care responsibilities.  </p>

          <p>Government intervention to provide a minimum statutory provision for carer’s leave would see societal benefits in carers being able to maintain their caring commitments, whilst maintaining their attachment to the labour market. Economic theory suggests that if the decision to offer carer’s leave was left to employers, market failure would result; individual employers would not provide socially optimal levels of leave as they would only consider the private benefits rather than the wider societal benefits associated with higher economic output, tax revenue and improved health outcomes. This is because providing leave for carers can be considered a positive externality. The same argument applies when an individual makes a choice in whether to work, care or combine both; there are indeed private benefits from being in employment, through higher earnings and future pension contributions but an individual may not consider the wider social benefits when making the decision to leave the labour market.  </p>

          <p>There are several benefits from providing a leave entitlement to carers, both to the individual carrying out the care and to society. Such an entitlement would allow employees to take time off to tend to those in need of care for a set period and avoid the need to use up their annual leave entitlements to offer support. In most cases, several days would be sufficient to deal with problems of a transitional nature. This would also give carers more certainty about their role in the workplace and ultimately help them balance their work and care commitments to remain in the labour market for longer.  </p>

          <p>There are also important business considerations; for employees who drop out of the labour market, this represents a significant cost to employers who have invested in their staff and then suffer from losing their skills and knowledge when they leave work to provide care. There may also be additional costs in having to replace these workers in the form of recruitment and training. Supporting carers in managing their care responsibilities alongside their work could boost staff retention and yield productivity gains for employers. Furthermore, people receiving informal care are likely to benefit from a leave entitlement as their carer’s mental health is likely to improve which will enable them to provide better care. In addition to this, carers may be less likely to feel like they need to stop providing care which would result in people in informal care being placed in formal care institutions. Research conducted by One Poll showed that nearly three quarters of people receiving care want to stay in their own homes as they get older, rather than move into residential care<authorialNote marker="27"><p> https://www.liveincarehub.co.uk/no-place-like-home-report/ </p></authorialNote>. </p>

          <p>There is also evidence from the Family Resource Survey (FRS) of gender inequality in the provision of unpaid care with existing survey data<authorialNote marker="28"><p> FRS 2016/17 </p></authorialNote> showing that women aged 45-64 years are most likely to be carers and more likely than men to provide informal care across all age groups, except for those aged 85 and older. Previous research has shown that women in their fifties are more likely to leave the labour market to provide unpaid care for family members than men. In the context of the gender pay gap, the fact that women are more likely to provide care means that they are more likely to face adverse employment effects associated with caring i.e., lower earnings and leaving the labour market. The evidence above also shows the high likelihood of women leaving the workforce as they approach retirement; maintaining workforce attachment would allow carers and women to contribute more to their pension.    </p>

          <p>This option would involve maintaining the status quo, where the decision to offer carers time off for work to juggle care and work responsibilities would be at the discretion of employers, with an unequal pattern across the labour force. Furthermore, this would do little to help carers remain in the workplace for longer and address the financial concerns associated with caring. Carers would also continue to rely on annual leave or sick days to manage their care responsibilities at detriment to their own physical and mental well-being. Lastly this option would not deliver the 2019 manifesto commitment or address the challenge of an ageing society.  </p>

          <p>This option would aim to raise awareness through a campaign and/or issue guidance to encourage employers to voluntarily offer provisions to employees in these circumstances. However, in the absence of statutory minima, individual employers may not provide a socially optimal standard and so some of these benefits may not be realised. In addition, employers are unlikely to offer consistent support which will lead to discrepancies between the support provided in individual cases, both across and within employers. The absence of minimum standards could result in some carers facing undue stress, additional costs and falling out of the labour market due to the difficulty in balancing employment and caring responsibilities. </p>

          <p>At present we have made use of the available evidence base to model the costs and benefits of introducing a statutory entitlement to Carer’s Leave. Where possible, we have made use of methodology employed in the Shared Parental Leave and Pay and the Parental Bereavement Leave Impact Assessments to better understand the costs and benefits faced by business. We have taken a proportionate approach to the analysis for this IA and drawn from evidence from the Work Life Balance Survey to estimate potential take-up<authorialNote marker="32"><p> https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-life-balance-survey-number-4 </p></authorialNote>. The central estimate for the take-up of Carer’s Leave is 29% of the population of carers. As well informed as this assumption might be, there is always a large degree of uncertainty around the take-up of this policy. We have attempted to address this uncertainty by conducting sensitivity analysis and flexing the take-up rate to 15% in the low take-up scenario and 45% in the high take-up scenario.  </p>

          <p>The evidence underpinning the population of carers in this Impact Assessment is estimated using the Family Resource Survey (FRS). The FRS is a continuous household survey which collects information on a sample of private households in the UK. It is one of the UK’s largest household surveys as it surveys around 20,000 households. It is carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) and provides statistics on the living standards and circumstances of people living in the UK, such as, caring needs and responsibilities. The most recent publication provides data on the </p>

        <subparagraph>
          <content>
            <p>number of carers in 2020/21. It shows that there are 4.2 million carers in the UK. The FRS also provides data on the number of carers which are in employment and have employee status. We use this to narrow the population of carers to the eligible population for this entitlement. This reveals that there are 1.9 million eligible carers in the UK. </p>

          <p>The model first attempts to build the target population that would be affected by the entitlement. The model then applies assumed take-up rates to the eligible population to give a sense of the total number of carers who may use the entitlement. The business costs are then estimated based on the estimated take-up population. For business costs, we calculate the costs of absence borne when employees are on leave and recurring administrative costs from processing leave requests. Furthermore, we also model the business familiarisation costs.  </p>

          <p>For employers who already have policies in place for carers, the introduction of the legislation would not impose any additional costs to these businesses.

However, male informal carers (9%) are more likely to be in self-employment compared to females (4%).

          <p>The estimate of eligible carers is essentially static, based on an estimate of the current stock of employee carers, whereby only those who are currently self-identifying as carers are counted. No allowance is made for a change in the number of employee carers due to either demographic change or behavioural change in the group as a result of the incentives this policy may generate. As the population ages and care needs become more complex the demand for informal care is likely to rise.  </p>

          <p>Estimating the proportion of eligible carers who would opt into the carer’s leave entitlement is uncertain given the number of influencing factors, which include the nature of the care need, financial incentives, workplace culture and family circumstances. The evidence of take-up rates for a carer’s entitlement is limited. Facing these evidence gaps, we have attempted to use evidence on take-up from the Work Life Balance Survey<authorialNote marker="36"><p> https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/work-life-balance-survey-number-4 </p></authorialNote>. In this survey, it estimated that 29% of employees with caring responsibilities would likely take unpaid time off for dependants which we believe to be a comparable policy to Carers Leave. Therefore, we have assumed a take-up rate of 29% when modelling the costs of Carer’s Leave. To account for uncertainty, we have created a low and high take-up rate to model the costs of this new entitlement. We have assumed a take-up of 15% for the low scenario and 45% for the high scenario. Stakeholders have indicated there is strong demand for this policy and therefore we think that it is unlikely that fewer than 15% of carers will take up this entitlement to Carer’s Leave. Alternatively, we think that fewer than 45% of carers will take this policy as evidence from other family friend leave entitlements, like Paternity Leave, which is around 60% based on the Parental Rights Survey<authorialNote marker="37"><p> Parental Rights Survey 2018 as yet unpublished </p></authorialNote> and this is a paid leave entitlement.  </p>

          <p>The Work Life Balance Survey did not examine the duration for which unpaid carer’s leave was taken. However, it is reasonable to expect that not all carers will use the full 5 days of Carer’s Leave available to them. Some carers will find fewer days sufficient for them to fulfil their caring needs, i.e., supporting someone who is attending a single hospital appointment. In addition to this, as this is an unpaid leave entitlement some carers will be disincentivised to take the full entitlement of leave, as they do not want to lose more of their income. Existing survey evidence shows that one of the key reasons for not taking leave is because of affordability.<authorialNote marker="38"><p> Maternity and Paternity Rights Survey (2009/10) </p></authorialNote> Therefore, it makes sense to taper the take-up rate, so it is highest for day 1 and lowest for day 5. We have modelled this with a simple linear taper and increased/decreased the take-up rate by 1.5% for the central scenario (0.5% for the low scenario and 3% for the high scenario) around the mean on day 3. This approach has been endorsed as a reasonable assumption to make the absence of stronger evidence by relevant stakeholders - Carer’s UK and CIPD.  </p>

          <p>This Impact Assessment does not include any monetised benefits, as assigning a value to the social benefits which could arise from the proposals is uncertain and it is difficult to establish what this means for different individuals. In addition to this the majority of benefits to employees are unobservable and therefore are hard to monetise, i.e., improved attachment to the labour market.  This is similar to other family related pay entitlement analysis, which also face this issue, such as in the Parental Bereavement Impact Assessment. </p>

          <p>Introducing a new entitlement for carers to take time away from work to care for a dependant would help in meeting the core policy objective of helping carers balance their working and caring commitments in a more sustainable and manageable manner. The Personal Social Services Research Unit (PSSRU) at the LSE used the 2009/10 Survey of Carers in Households and 2010 ONS population data to estimate the public expenditure costs resulting from carers leaving the labour market to be £1.3 billion a year based on the costs of Carers Allowance and lost tax</p>

          <p>The PSSRU have since updated their estimates of the number of carers who have left employment due to their caring responsibilities, using 2011 census data, to claim that 345,000 carers have left employment and have claimed that their earlier estimates understated the true public expenditure costs of carers leaving the labour market. In addition, they state that their previous study only quantified the cost of Carer’s Allowance (CA) and tax receipts on foregone income. In more recent analysis they have presented additional estimates of other key benefits carers may receive once they have left employment such as Housing Benefit and Income Support. Including these with other benefits carers may claim, they find they estimate the annual public expenditure costs of carers leaving work to be £2.9 billion per year. This is made up of £1.7 billion in social security benefits paid to unpaid carers who have left employment and an additional £1.2 billion due to taxes not collected on foregone income.<authorialNote marker="40"><p> Pickard, Linda, et al.

          <p>Whilst we cannot say that the introduction of such a leave entitlement will prevent these carers from leaving the labour market, especially in the most severe cases, the availability of provisions to better manage working and caring responsibilities will give carers additional support alongside existing rights such as the right to request flexible working and other flexible working practices e.g., flexitime and part-time working. Even if the leave entitlement prevents a small fraction of those who otherwise would have left employment, additional benefits will accrue from people being able to earn more income over their life and contribute to the public finances in the form of tax receipts.  </p>

          <p>In addition to this, the total expenditure in 2019/20 on adult social care by local authorities was £23.3 billion, up more than £1 billion from the previous year. However, in real terms (i.e., adjusting for inflation), total expenditure was only £99 million more than the level it was in 2010/11, despite increasing demand for services. The increasing number of care-dependent people leads to a high economic burden for most healthcare systems.  In addition to this, the pandemic has led to an increase of around 200,000 people classed as “long-term sick” who are likely to require care<authorialNote marker="43"><p> https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/employmentintheuk/latest https://www.ons.gov.uk/employmentandlabourmarket/peopleinwork/employmentandemployeetypes/bulletins/employmentintheuk/latest </p><p>46 https://www.researchgate.net/publication/331726283_Needs_and_preferences_of_informal_caregivers_regarding_outpatient_care_for_the_eld erly_A_systematic_literature_review </p></authorialNote>.  Institutional care is the primary cost driver in long-term care and costs for long-term care in nursing homes exceed those of home-based care 46. Hence, enabling care-dependent people to stay in a home-based care setting is an efficient cost-cutting strategy for funding agencies.  </p>

          <p>Employers could benefit from lower staff turnover through a new leave entitlement, if fewer carers leave the labour market in order tend to someone in need of care. This will reduce recruitment and training costs. A CIPD survey<authorialNote marker="44"><p> Sample based on responses of 1,068 HR professionals.  </p></authorialNote> of HR professionals representing organisations of all sizes found the median cost for hiring all employees to be £2,000 in 2017.

Savings in training costs could also flow from the policy as staff who would need to be recruited require training in order to reach the level of productivity of previous employees. In keeping these people in work for longer, employers will benefit from having skilled and experienced staff and the human capital they have accumulated over their careers, which would be difficult to replace in the event that they left the workplace.  </p>

          <p>A key objective of introducing this policy would be to better support carers in managing their caring and work responsibilities. An entitlement to leave, similar to existing rights available to parents, will help carers achieve a better work-life balance. Policies that promote a healthier work-life balance can yield real benefits to employees. Indeed, in feeling more in control of their working lives, people are likely to benefit from improvements in their health and overall well-being. There is a clear link between caring and negative health and social outcomes, which emerges from the evidence base. A survey<authorialNote marker="47"><p> Survey of household carers, 2009/10 </p></authorialNote> of carers found that 29% of carers felt their caring responsibilities had led to feelings of stress. The results were more pronounced for females (34%) compared to males (22%). Carers were also asked whether their personal relationships and social life has been affected; the same report found that 42% had been affected in some manner, with the vast majority (69%) of these respondents stating that providing care meant they had less time for leisure activities. This was a finding that was consistent in its prevalence among different age groups. </p>

          <p>Evidence submitted to the Work and Pensions Committee found that many carers were forced to use annual leave or sick days to fulfil their caring responsibilities. Creating an additional entitlement to leave would help offer carers more time and space to carry out the activities they value the most. In light of findings above this could lead to benefits in health and social outcomes, which would help reduce the strain on formal healthcare infrastructure. Quantifying the value of these benefits is made complex as it is difficult to precisely attribute the impact the policy proposals will have on these outcomes. </p>

          <p>As the entitlement to Carer’s Leave is unpaid, carers wishing to use this new entitlement will have to forego earnings in order to take the leave and fulfil their caring duties. The loss of these earnings will impose a cost on individuals. However, employees will only take up this policy if the benefit of taking the leave outweighs the lost earnings. This, therefore, highlights that employees who take up this new entitlement believe that it is value for money and an overall benefit to them.  </p>

          <p>The survey results shows that the amount of unpaid leave using bands, however, in order to calculate the deadweight, we must recreate the distribution in days. To do this assume within each band the number of days offered is equally distributed. Thus, for the 19% of firms that offer 4 – 6 days, we assume that 6.3% each offer 4, 5 and 6 days of leave. We must also bear in mind that this distribution only reflects those firms that currently do offer leave for carers and thus to calculate this percentage relative to all firms we multiply the proportion of firms offering a given amount of leave by 59%.  </p>

To calculate this relative to <u>all firms</u>, we apply the 59% figure to obtain the relevant statistic, finding that 26.3% (44.5% x 59%), provide at least 10 days of leave.  </p>

          <p>However, as this is not a specific leave entitlement for carers, awareness and take-up of this leave is low and carers continue to juggle work and care without taking time away from work. Evidence submitted to the Work and Pensions Committee highlighted that carer’s leave was “still relatively rare.” Currently, there are no rights for carers in the UK to take leave from paid work to care for another dependant unless for an emergency or to care children aged under 18. Whilst some employers may offer career breaks or sabbaticals, there is no legal requirement for them to offer this meaning that employees may face uncertainty upon returning to work.   </p>

          <p>Finally, BEIS commissioned IFF Research to undertake the Employee Rights and Experience Survey in 2020, with the aim of providing updated and statistically reliable evidence on the experiences of employees and workers in the modern workplace. It covers a range of topics, including employee’s awareness of carers leave and the percentage of employees who are able to take unpaid leave to provide care. The Employee Rights and Experiences Survey, which is currently not yet published, finds that amongst carers who had the option to take carers leave, just over half indicated that it would count as unpaid leave (53%). </p>

          <p>In this Impact assessment we assume that 53% of the administration costs is deadweight and therefore should not be included. Deadweight also needs to be accounted for when calculating the absence costs. However, in line with our earlier assumption that the take-up rate will be highest for day 1 and lowest for day 5 and the above CIPD evidence which shows that the deadweight will also be highest for day 1, we have decided to also taper the deadweight. In accordance with the CIPD evidence, we have made an assumption that deadweight will fall by 3% for every additional day of leave. Table 9 below shows how the deadweight changes over the 5-day period. </p>

          <p>Evidence submitted to the Work and Pensions Committee found that carers were having to use their annual leave when providing care. One of the intended effects of the policy would be to give carers the means to use a new entitlement for caring, giving them more time to enjoy the things they value. This might reduce the amount of annual leave taken over the course of the year for some employees, as they no longer use their full annual leave entitlement. Alternatively, some employees may prefer to use their annual leave for caring responsibilities, as this is an unpaid entitlement and annual leave is paid at full-pay. Given the lack of evidence here, we have not modelled any displacement/interaction effects that the new entitlement would have on annual leave. </p>

          <p>Creating a new entitlement will create familiarisation costs for business. Whilst this would create a new burden for employers in understanding the new rights, we would imagine this would be proportionate to the size of the business. Consultation with businesses for the Parental Bereavement Leave (PBL) Impact Assessment led to the view that small and medium size businesses (fewer than 50 employees) will only familiarise themselves fully with the legislation on a case-by-case basis and do little upon policy implementation. This means that when the legislation is introduced, businesses with fewer than 50 employees may opt to spend a short time viewing online guidance but little beyond this. Instead, we assume they will spend additional time when they are processing requests (recurring administrative costs) to account for their lack of familiarity but making it dependent on estimated case numbers. </p>

          <p>Conversely, larger businesses are more likely to spend more in familiarising themselves with the legislation upon introduction and will have dedicated HR functions to understand changes to employment law. Furthermore, large businesses will also have a higher likelihood of experiencing an eligible employee claiming Carer’s leave due their size. Companies with existing leave policies for carers will also experience these costs to understand how this interacts with the statutory entitlement. </p>

          <p>The legislation will, as far as possible, follow the structure of existing family related leave entitlements. Therefore, we would expect familiarisation to only impose a limited burden on businesses. Some of the familiarisation could include understanding how employer’s own leave schemes interact with the leave entitlement and update their internal guidance accordingly. How far employers go beyond understanding the entitlement and updating systems would be at their own discretion and therefore our estimates do not account for this</p>

          <p>The Business Population Estimates only provides a category for the public sector for businesses with zero or one employee. We have used the ratio of the private sector and applied it to the whole economy. Private sector businesses make up the vast majority of the business population, so aggregate results are not strongly affected by this.</p>

          <p>Recurring administrative costs are assumed to be the cost of administering requests for Carer’s leave. We estimate the number of requests based on the level of take-up outlined above for low, central and high case scenarios.  </p>

          <p>As discussed above, we assume businesses with fewer than 50 employees will not conduct any familiarisation of the policy until they need to process a leave request. We therefore assume that businesses with fewer than 50 employees will take longer to process an application than larger businesses. Our estimates allow for half an hour of processing time for larger businesses and an hour for businesses with fewer than 50 employees to account for time spent calling helplines for specialised advice (e.g., consulting a lawyer) or looking up ACAS) guidance (i.e., the equivalent of familiarisation). This mirrors the approach taken in the PBL Impact Assessment, which allowed for businesses spending an additional 60 minutes to familiarise with policy each time they processed a leave request. As with the familiarisation costs, we assume that in businesses with 50+ employees an HR Manager/Director will process any claims. For businesses with fewer than 50 employees we assume a Manager/Director/Senior Official will process requests as they are unlikely to have a dedicated HR team and spend half an hour per case. </p>

          <p>Based on ASHE data, we use the uprated average wage (including non-wage labour costs) for an HR Manager/Director of £31.27 per hour. For a Manager/Director/Senior Official (for firms with fewer than 50 employees) we estimate an uprated wage rate of £31.30 per hour. The cap on the number of weeks available does not impact the recurring administrative costs. The costs are based on the number who would qualify for the leave entitlement<authorialNote marker="51"><p> ASHE wage rate for Manager/Director/Senior Official = £20.60. 20.60*1.207 = £24.86   </p></authorialNote>. </p>

          <p>Absence costs are those incurred by businesses due to their employee taking Carer’s Leave and represent reorganisation costs. For example, the cost of employing temporary cover which is likely to be more expensive than the absent employee and could be less productive. Businesses may also have to reallocate work among existing staff, whilst the staff are absent and could incur higher costs from having to pay existing staff overtime in order to keep output constant or may even reallocate resources from elsewhere, resulting in a loss in output. </p>

          <p>To account for the fact that not all carers will make use of the full entitlement we divided the weekly reorganisation cost (£203.60) by 5 to find the daily reorganisation cost. Using the tapered estimated number of people taking Carer’s Leave (after accounting for deadweight) we then calculated the reorganisation costs for each day of leave.  </p>

          <p>Some employees who take up their entitlement to unpaid carer’s leave may become eligible to claim Carer’s Allowance, depending on their circumstances – e.g. if they are providing care for at least 35 hours a week, if the individual receiving the care is entitled to certain benefits, and if the carer is earning less than £128 per week. Therefore, the introduction of Carer’s Leave could make a small proportion of  carers eligible for Carer’s Allowance, if their  average wage falls and / or the hours of care they are providing increases.  Carer’s Allowance currently entitles an individual to £67.60 a week (subject to the conditions above), and so this could create a cost for the Exchequer.  </p>

          <p>In a similar way, it is possible that individuals could make claims for Universal Credit as a result of their pay reducing by 1 to 5 days when they take up their entitlement to unpaid carer’s leave. However, it is considered unlikely that many households will make a new claim given the temporary and time limited nature of unpaid carer’s leave.  The more likely impact would be that households already claiming Universal Credit it would see a small automatic increase in their payment if their monthly earnings were lower. This could create a cost for the Exchequer. </p>

          <p>BEIS has worked closely with the Department for Work and Pensions to understand the potential cost impact on both Carer’s Allowance and Universal Credit.  These costs are subject to a high level of uncertainty driven by the nuanced interaction with the benefits system and the behaviour of those individuals on Carer’s Leave, which we cannot predict with certainty.  We expect any increase to be very small. </p>

          <p>The proposed policy will affect employees of all sizes, including small and micro-businesses. We do not intend to exempt small and micro-businesses from the new entitlement. Exempting them from the new entitlement would not help in meeting the intended policy objectives for carers who happen to work in smaller businesses. Allowing for minimum statutory rights of employees to differ across employers would create problems in the overall delivery of carer’s leave and would undermine equal rights of employees. The policy needs to be consistent across employers for it to work. Benefits described above such as increases in tax revenue, savings in recruitment costs and increased tax revenues would mean a large chunk of these would not materialise in the event that small and microbusinesses were exempted from the policy. Whilst these benefits are yet to be quantified, where possible, their existence is independent of the size of the business. </p>

          <p>Using Business population statistics56, we estimate that about 97% of businesses affected are small and micro businesses and these businesses account for 29% of employees.57 We have no information on whether eligible carers are more or less likely to work in smaller or larger businesses compared to the rest of population. We therefore assume that around 29% of eligible working carers are likely to work for small and micro-businesses. We qualify this on this basis that the definition of unpaid carers in this Impact Assessment has been designed to be fairly broad, shown by the large proportion of employees in the workforce who provide unpaid care whilst working. For this reason, we have limited information to suggest that unpaid carers are likely to work in smaller or large size firms relative to the wider employee population.  </p>

This means that women are more likely to provide care and therefore they are more likely to face adverse employment effects associated with caring i.e., lower earnings and leaving the labour market.

This assumption comes from evidence from the Employee Rights Survey, that identified the number of employers which already offer unpaid leave.

            <p><b>Annex A: Estimating absence costs to employers  </b></p>
            <blockContainer>
              <num>136.</num>
              <p>The policy assessed in this impact assessment covers the introduction of Carer’s Leave legislation. This policy will result in absence costs to employers as employee carers would have a right to take a week of unpaid leave. This annex explains the underlying assumptions and derives re-organisation. </p>

              <p>Reorganisation costs: </p>

            <blockContainer>
              <num>•</num>
              <p>Employing temporary cover, which is likely to be more expensive than the absent employee and may also be less productive. </p>
            </blockContainer>
            <blockContainer>
              <num>•</num>
              <p>Re-allocating work among existing staff, which is costly because either additional overtime is paid so that output remains constant, or because in re-allocating work, some other work is dropped, resulting in a loss of output. </p>
            </blockContainer>
            <blockContainer>
              <num>•</num>
              <p>Not covering the absent employee’s work and accepting a loss of output. </p>

            <blockContainer>
              <num>138.</num>
              <p>The choice between different types of cover will be influenced by four factors: the duration of absences and their nature (planned or unplanned, with for example, firms less likely to employ temporary cover for shorter absences), the size of the company/workplace, the nature of the business, and the skills needed in the particular job. While we recognise that differences in these factors mean that employers may use different methods to cover absence in different cases, we consider that in terms of employer costs, the same assumptions apply in each case. While these might not describe the situation for each employer perfectly, we feel that this simplified approach describes the overall impacts on employers sufficiently well without overcomplicating this impact assessment. </p>
            </blockContainer>
            <p><b><u>Reorganisation costs</u></b></p>
            <blockContainer>
              <num>139.</num>
              <p>Quantifying the impact of absence from the policies under discussion is difficult for several reasons i.e., identifying productivity loss from someone being away from work and accordingly having to rely on temporary cover. We rely on earlier analysis to model the impact on business, making use of the PBL impact assessment. This first involves estimating the cost of reorganisation, which makes use of the most recent absence cost estimates from survey on absence and workplace health published by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). </p>
            </blockContainer>
            <blockContainer>
              <num>140.</num>
              <p>The survey found an average cost of absence of £720 per employee per year, based on an average of 5.2 days absence per employee. This figure includes the wage costs of absence, as well as an estimate of the reorganisation costs and non-wage labour costs, such as national insurance. Failing to uprate the average weekly wage costs to include National Insurance and employers’ pension contributions would implicitly assume that such costs only arise in the case an employee is absent (as they are included in the absence costs), but not when the employee is present at work. </p>
            </blockContainer>
            <blockContainer>
              <num>141.</num>
              <p>Based on ONS data<authorialNote marker="53"><p> ONS, Index of Labour Costs per Hour UK (2019 Q4 - 2020 Q3 average) </p></authorialNote>, we find that that non-wage labour costs are 19.75% of wage costs. Including non-wage costs, we uplift the wage costs by this percentage to derive total labour costs of £512. Deducting this figure from the median absence cost estimate above yields a reorganisation cost of £180 (35.1% of labour costs). We then convert this into 2021 prices.
