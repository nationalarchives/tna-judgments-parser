          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is Macquarie’s second summary judgment application in these proceedings. The first proceeded on the basis that there was no issue to be tried as to whether or not the Transaction had been terminated, and sought payment of the amount which would have been due even if Phelan was correct in its contention that the trades had proceeded to their maturity date. That application did not proceed to judgment, because Phelan agreed to an order requiring it to pay the amount claimed (US$ 14,719,523.18) within a stipulated time period which has since been extended on an “unless order” basis.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Macquarie brings this further summary judgment application on the basis that, even if it is Phelan and not Macquarie who is right about the strike price for the ZAR payment due on 28 May 2021, there was nonetheless an Event of Default and Macquarie was entitled to and did terminate the Transaction on 4 June 2021. On this occasion, therefore, Macquarie invites the court summarily to determine the termination issue in its favour, while accepting that there remains a triable issue as to what the correct strike price is, and to order an interim payment in its favour in an amount equivalent to the Early Termination Amount as it would have been due had the Transaction been on the terms alleged by Phelan (<span style="font-weight:bold">the Alternative Early Termination Amount</span>).</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Between 13 and 14 May 2021, there were emails and a telephone call between Macquarie and Phelan about the terms of proposed new trades, in which Macquarie initially proposed a ZAR strike price of 22.05 for the trade due to settle on 28 May 2021 (Macquarie’s email of 13.28 on 13 May 2021). There is a dispute between the parties as to whether that trade was concluded by reference to that strike price, or whether the deal was done by reference to a strike price of 22.16. It is the latter figure which appears in the trade recap email sent by Macquarie to Phelan at 12.44 on 14 May 2021, but the status of that document is in dispute. However, there is no dispute that a swap was concluded on 14 May 2021 for settlement on 28 May 2021 (<span style="font-weight:bold">the 28 May 2021 Settlement Trade</span>).</p>

As Lord Hoffmann observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Mannai</span>, 774, the issue of whether the required information has been communicated unambiguously does not solely depend on the language used alone, and there can be an unambiguous communication of information even when the communication in question involves a mistake.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">An important feature of the ISDA Master Agreement is that a party entitled to an Early Termination Amount is, within certain limits, entitled to quantify the amount of the payment <span style="font-style:italic">after the debt has arisen</span>. Those limits include the requirement to act “in good faith and use commercially reasonable procedures in order to produce a commercially reasonable result” (which appear in the definition of “close-out amount” in section 14). If no such calculation is performed, it is clear that this does not render the debt which has accrued forever unquantified or unpayable.

However, Macquarie’s (assumed) error as to one of the terms of the contract relied upon does not mean that a claim quantified on the correct basis involves a new cause of action.

Likewise I do not agree with the judge's conclusion as set out in paragraph 16, that once ‘sufficient details’ of both the calculation of the sum claimed and of the bank account into which the sum was to be paid ‘the notice is … effective’. The use by the draftsman of the word ‘notice’, in conjunction with the word ‘effective’, in section 6(d)(ii) in order to ascertain the Payment Date must, in my judgment, be a reference to the language of section 12 , which expressly addresses the question of the precise day upon which a notice is deemed to be ‘effective’. The words used in section 6(d) (ii) (i.e. ‘on the day that notice of the amount payable is effective’) are not, in my view, addressing a wholly different concept of ‘effectiveness’ – namely the concept that a section 6(d)(i) statement (or notice) can only be ‘effective’ once all the details required to be contained in such a statement are supplied, a date which may be unclear and open to argument. On the contrary, section 6(d)(ii) is referring to when, in accordance with the provisions of section 12 , the notice is ‘effective’, viz. a specific delivery date, identified by the provisions of section 12.</p>

It would be surprising, to say the least, if that debt obligation could never be enforced, because, on the appellants' analysis, the obligation to pay such sum never arose, and therefore the Non-defaulting Party had to sue for some entirely different amount, which it might be able to establish at its loss as the result of the Defaulting Party's breach of contract.”</p>

I accept that the passages in bold lend some support to the argument that notice of the amount payable is necessary for the debt to become payable.

Section 5(b)(v) had been supplemented in that case by an additional termination event for “Russian market events”, with both parties being treated as affected parties and with the “loss” measure to be used in calculating the amounts payable on termination. One party (SG) served a notice of a “Russian market event”, contending that both parties were required to serve their calculation of loss or gain. The parties agreed an early termination date of 24 September 1998, and provided their respective calculations on 1 October 1998. A significant feature of the case was that the net amount payable was dependent on the combined effect of the calculations of <span style="font-style:italic">both </span>parties. ANZ disputed SG’s calculation, and the court upheld that challenge. A dispute arose as to which interest rate was payable to ANZ, the contractual termination rate or the default rate.

But in the present case neither side produced a notice of the amount payable because of the dispute as to how the losses of SG should be calculated. The calculation of SG, even if it is ultimately found to be wrong, was, in the words of the ‘loss’ clause, ‘reasonably determined [by SG] to be its total losses and costs’. Therefore if the parties, in good faith, fail to agree on the amount payable in accordance with s. 6(e), and so no effective notice was produced, then no ‘payment date’ can be determined. Therefore the ‘payment date’ will only arrive upon the court's determination of the proper basis for calculating SG's losses. Until that time SG is not in default and so does not have to pay the ‘default rate’.”</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">More significantly, in all other cases, there is a move from the Applicable Deferral Rate (which is derived from an inter-bank interest rate) to the Termination Rate (“the arithmetic mean of the cost .. to each party (as certified by such party) if it were to fund or of funding such amounts”) once the Early Termination Amount becomes payable.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">It might be said that notice of one party’s calculation of the Early Termination Amount, even if the calculation is incorrect and not binding as to the amount due, is nonetheless sufficient to render the Early Termination Amount payable in such amount as the court later determines. There are authorities which, in other contexts, have held that notice of a failure to pay a debt will be valid and trigger the obligation to pay even if the wrong amount is given in the notice (collected <span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">in </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">Lombard North Central Plc v European Skyjets Ltd </span><span style="color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">[2022] EWHC 728 (QB), [108]). However, none of these authorities address the complex architecture of the ISDA Master Agreement and the differential in interest rates before and after the “date on which [the] amount is payable” for parties other than Defaulting and Non-Defaulting Parties, which might be said to reflect an assumption that on the date on which the amount becomes payable, the amount which must be paid will be known.</span></p>

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">It might be said that if an invalid Early Termination Amount is served, such that the court must then determine the amount, the machinery for rendering the debt payable has broken down, and is replaced by an obligation to pay the debt within a reasonable time (which would have regard to the point at which the paying party would reasonably be aware of the amount to be paid). There are other commercial contexts in which a <span style="font-style:italic">debitum in praesentum solvendum in futuro </span>has been held to have become payable in such circumstances: in the charterparty context in <span style="font-style:italic">Vagres Compania Maritima SA v Nissho-Iwai American Corp (The Karin Vatis </span>[1988] 2 Lloyd’s 330, 332-333 and 336-337 and <span style="font-style:italic">Bank of Boston Connecticut v European Grain and Shipping </span>Ltd [1989] AC 10561098-99; and in the sale of goods context in <span style="font-style:italic">Alexander v Gardner </span>(1835) 1 Bing N Cas 671 and <span style="font-style:italic">Fragano v Long </span>(1825) 4 B &amp; C 218).

Given that interest will run in respect of the period before such a notice is served (albeit in some cases at a different rate), it might be said that no significant practical detriment would follow from this approach.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The late stage at which the correct legal classification of Macquarie’s claim came into focus meant that there was no sufficient opportunity at the hearing to explore the first two alternatives, and it would not be appropriate to resolve those issues without the benefit of full argument, given their potential impact on such a widely used form. In these circumstances, I have decided to proceed for the purposes of the interim payment application on the basis that Macquarie would only be entitled to obtain a judgment at trial for the Alternative Early Termination Amount if notice of that amount had been served so as to make it clear beyond scope for argument that such an amount was payable (there being no suggestion that this has already been done), albeit without prejudice to its case as to the validity of the notice of the Early Termination Amount it has already given.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, in its application of 14 April 2022, Macquarie made clear the basis on which it contended that it had used the spot rate most favourable to Phelan, and exhibited the relevant documents. Phelan served no evidence in response. Having failed to answer this aspect of Macquarie’s claim, it cannot now resist an interim payment on the basis that something may come out of the woodwork in the expert evidence. This does not render the order for expert evidence unnecessary because it will still be necessary at trial to determine whether Macquarie is entitled to more than the amount for which it seeks an interim payment.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Second, by way of a late developing point, it was said that there was reason to believe Macquarie had made a “highly material” (but unquantified) gain on a hedging contract it had taken out in relation to its exposure to Phelan, and that it is arguable that such a profit needs to be brought into account when calculating the Alternative Early Payment Amount. In this context, Mr Hobson relied upon the definition of “Close-out Amount”, and in particular the words:</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Hardwick KC objected that if there had been such a gain, and if it had to be brought into account in the calculation of the Early Termination or Alternative Early Termination Amount (neither of which were admitted), the maximum amount was of the order of US$165,000. However, there was no evidence supporting this figure. In the absence of such evidence, but having regard to the circumstances in which the point arose and the fact that experts’ reports will be exchanged on 28 October 2022, I decided to adjourn this aspect of the interim payment application, with liberty to restore once the expert reports have been exchanged.</p>
