He had thought that the only criteria was that he had traded as a self-employed individual in the years 2016/17 to 2018/19.  The officer explained that those were the years upon which the grant was calculated and confirmed that the screens in the application showed the eligibility criteria.

That is consistent with the information held elsewhere and which has not been challenged such as the two documents headed “Check claim status”. On the balance of probability, the screenshots must have been part of the claim process since the claim had to be submitted online. We accept the assertion in the review conclusion letter that there had been no technical issues at the time the claims were made. It is difficult to see how the claims could have been made without being on the Declaration page since the virtual “button” to submit is on that page.</p>

Undoubtedly, at all relevant times, he was a fitness coach but that trade was conducted until 31 July 2018 by him as a sole trader and thereafter by his company. Those are two completely separate and different legal persons. As a sole trader he paid income tax. The company pays corporation tax. PAYE is deducted from the appellant’s earnings from the company but it is not his trade. It is his employment.</p>
