He did however (along, it would appear, with other defendants) plead guilty at a further case management hearing on 13 May 2021, that hearing being described by the Determining Officer as the first formal opportunity for the Defendant to plead. The Appellant had prepared a Defence Statement by that stage and the guilty plea came as something of a surprise to the Appellant.</p>

Four months later, the defendant pleaded guilty, so the trial did not go ahead.

              <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">“The Legal Aid Agency’s Crown Court Fee Guidance accurately describes the essence of a cracked trial as being that after the PTPH there is still the real possibility of a trial. The express way of this occurring is of course for the defendant to plead not guilty. But the guidance refers to the court setting a trial date as being a way of marking the possibility that a trial will go ahead. That description in itself suggests that a formal plea it the PTPH is not an absolute requirement.”</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There are two situations in which a cracked trial fee will be due under Schedule 2 to the 2013 Regulations. The first requires, before any other condition is met, that the assisted person enters a plea of not guilty to one or more counts at the first hearing at which he or she enters a plea. It has no application to this case.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The second is that a case is listed for trial without a hearing at which the assisted person enters a plea. This could be read in one of two ways: that there is no hearing at which the assisted person enters a plea, or that there is such a hearing, but the case is listed for trial before it takes place.</p>

I note that Costs Judge Rowley does not appear to have been referred to that decision, quite possibly because it was not available at the time. Costs Judge Brown’s decision merits reading in full, but I will attempt to summarise it here.</p>

If the definition of a “cracked trial” covers any case listed for trial before a plea is entered, then applying the 2013 Regulations mechanistically (as one must)  the definition would extend all such cases, even those which proceed to a full trial. I do not think that that could be right.</p>
