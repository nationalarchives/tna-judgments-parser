              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">There was a Case Management Hearing in this matter before me on 26 February 2021. The outcome was that parties made various concessions and retired to negotiate a possible way forward. </p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Thereafter, HMRC wrote to the Tribunal on 24 March 2021 stating that the parties had settled the appellant’s appeal against HMRC’s decisions issued on 14 February 2013. Those decisions had been issued under Section 8 Social Security Contributions (Transfer of Functions etc) Act 1999 (“Section 8 decisions”) regarding the earnings of each of A Dugdale and A Roe in relation to the period 6 April 2011 to 5 April 2012. On the same day, the appellant also emailed the Tribunal confirming the position.</p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On 9 April 2021, in response to a query from the Tribunal, the appellant’s agent wrote to the Tribunal stating that the appeal had not been withdrawn and the appellant was proceeding with the remainder of the appeal.  Furthermore, the appellant had notified HMRC and the Tribunal that they intended to apply to the Tribunal for costs in respect of the issues arising from the Section 8 decisions.</p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In November 2021, I issued Directions asking the parties to agree Directions in order to progress this appeal. The parties entered further negotiations but it proved impossible to agree Case Management Directions.

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">There has now been compliance with some of those Directions so, to an extent, the summary decision has been overtaken by events, but HMRC have requested full written findings and reasons in this matter.

Whether the rule is varied in any particular appeal, as the opening words of rule 27(2) make clear it can be, is a matter for the discretion of the FTT in that case. Any such direction is made under rule 5 of FTT Rules which provides that the FTT may, among other things, make directions in relation to the conduct of proceedings and the provision of information and documents. The use of the word “may” in Rule 5 means that it is also a matter of judicial discretion whether to make such directions. The power of the FTT to make directions under rule 5 of the FTT Rules is a case management power which must be exercised in accordance with the overriding objective in rule 2 of the FTT Rules which is to enable the tribunal to deal with cases fairly and justly.”</p>
