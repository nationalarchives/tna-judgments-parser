The respondents (or “</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">HMRC</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”) have decided that for certain VAT periods, input VAT claimed by the appellant (alternatively “</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">HFIM</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">” or “</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">the company</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”) should not be allowed. They say this on the basis that during those periods, the appellant did not carry-on a business or economic activity, nor was there any direct and immediate link between the inputs and outputs during those periods. These inputs include legal fees incurred by the appellant in relation to litigation conducted in the Seychelles.

Appeal number 2020/00815 is against a decision by HMRC to disallow input tax for the periods 03/19 and 06/19, and a consequential assessment for £7,896 (together with interest of £50.87). Appeal number 2020/01318 is against HMRC’s decision to disallow input tax for the period 09/19 in the sum of £2,665. Appeal number 2020/03154 is against HMRCs decision to disallow input tax for the periods 03/20 and 06/20 in the sum of £4,096.98.

It is clear from the decision in Finland that the mere receipt of payment does not, per se, mean that a given activity is economic in nature: thus, payment does not per se amount to consideration.

It seems to me that Section 3 VATA does not quite cover the ground laid out in Article 9 PVD in that it defines a “taxable person” as a person who is, or is required to be, registered for VAT and therefore excludes a person who is entitled to be registered for VAT pursuant to paragraphs 9 or 10 of Schedule 1 VATA but is not actually registered because the Respondents fail to satisfy their obligations under those paragraphs.  The relevant section ought in my view to include such persons in the definition of “taxable person”.  Nevertheless, nothing turns on this because it is common ground that the Appellant is entitled to rely on its rights under the PVD to the extent that those are inconsistent with the UK domestic legislation.  Accordingly, for the purposes of this decision, I will refer almost exclusively to the relevant provisions of the PVD. </span></p>

The first test relates to Article 2 PVD and is satisfied if the relevant person is making supplies for a consideration, whilst the second test relates to article 9 PVD and is satisfied if the relevant person is making the supplies for the purposes of obtaining income therefrom on a continuing basis – see paragraph [52] in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">Wakefield</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:#000000">.   </span></p>

There are a number of ECJ authorities to that effect which are summarised in the Upper Tribunal decision in Norseman. I believe that it is common ground that a person who incurs VAT input tax with the intention of making future supplies for a consideration should both be treated as carrying on an economic activity during the period in which it has that intention but has yet to make the supplies in question and entitled to deduct the VAT input tax which is attributable to those expected future supplies even if the expected future supplies subsequently do not occur. But, insofar as that is not common ground, I consider that this is the effect of ECJ decisions such as those in Belgium v Ghent Coal Terminal NV (Case C-37/95) [1998] STC 260, [1998] ECR 1-4321 and Finanzamt Goslar v Breitsohl 4321 (Case C- 400/98) [2001] STC 355, [2000] ECR 1-4321”.</span></p>

The description of the services was “fees for services provided between May 2016 and July 2016 and agreed. The services included attending meetings, reviewing the strategy of XMG market-making project, the opportunity, putting the information together to analyse performance, the management time spent by HFIM team. Providing assistance on materials and assisting with introduction to interested market professionals.” The second is dated 13 September 2019 reference 2019/1 and is for £1,200 net plus VAT of £240 making a total of £1,440. The narrative states that it is Stage 1:10% introductory fee on £12,000 (plus VAT) in relation to [that particular client]. The third is dated 13 December 2019 reference 2019/2 and is for a net amount of £1,000 together with VAT of £200 making a total of £1200.

The purpose of attendance at these events was to search for new potential clients, business leads and ideas, to gather information and to develop relationships with investors, hedge fund managers, third party introducers/marketers, distributors, investment consultants and advisers. It was also to develop relationships and gather information on the latest or emerging investment strategies developed by industry participants. In support of this, we were shown a document entitled “Enhancing Risk-Adjusted Returns through Emerging Alpha Strategies”. This is expressed to be a business plan dated August 2018 and intended for professional investors and eligible counterparties only. It deals with the asset management industry. It deals with the benefits of early stage investing and emerging strategies, and sets out the value proposition of the company and why an investor should invest in it. It is a highly professional document which deals with the intricacies of investment in a coherent, comprehensive manner, using accessible yet technical terms.</span></p>

Those accounts appear to reflect two sources of income. The first is entitled “Turnover” and reflects the anticipated income arising from the Seychelles litigation. The second is “Other operating income” and reflects other income for example foreign exchange gains and losses. It is for this reason that the turnover of the company between 2011 and 2018, and the operating profit/loss in those years, seems to fluctuate wildly. For example, for the year to 30 June 2014, its turnover was £97,126 and it made an operating loss of £260,629. For the year ended 30 December 2018, its turnover was £30,458 yet it made an operating profit of £922,897.</span></p>

In November 2010, Mr Patel discovered that the company’s business (and therefore income) had been diverted by a former director of HFIL to HIL. The company started litigation in the Seychelles to recover that income. In 2012 the directors of HFIM Emerging Alpha Strategies Fund, the Irish fund which was party to the prospectus, and which was a client of HFIM, became concerned about the potential reputational consequences arising from the litigation and the amount of management time that would be required to focus on it. The directors of the fund therefore resolved to temporarily suspend the fund management activities with a view to recommencing them once the litigation was resolved. The litigation (and therefore suspension of the fund management activities) was not expected to be for long, but as a result of delays in the proceedings, resolution of the litigation is ongoing.</span></p>

Under the <span style="font-style:italic">Norseman</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Gold </span>tests, the appellant needs to show that at the time it incurred input tax it had the intention of making, at some time in the future, supplies for a consideration. These must be taxable supplies. The evidence shows that the appellant at all times had the intention of making taxable supplies for consideration. Furthermore, the payments for the supplies of the appellant’s services which would be made in the future (as far as the input tax was concerned) was linked to the input tax incurred (as far as the outputs were concerned) in the past.</p>

The appellant has maintained its regulated status enabling it to undertake investment business. This reflects that it has fulfilled its compliance duties. Since 2012, the company has made approximately 30 introductions to various investors, third-party introducers and fund managers. Through this, the company has generated fees. Even though there are risks that some of these activities will not generate fees, the agreements which the company has entered into, have value and demonstrate current business activity.</p>

HMRC seem to suggest that the company had no customers. This is incorrect. The company had numerous clients and customers for whom it worked and for whom it effected introductions.

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The appellant’s case is that throughout the periods covered by these appeals, it was an intending trader. We have set out the law, at some length, which applies to the ability to recover input tax by such a trader. The principles can be distilled into the following: Firstly, the trader needs to be able to show on the evidence that at the time that it incurred input tax it intended to make taxable supplies (i.e. supplies for a consideration which are not exempt). Secondly the trader must also show either that those inputs are attributable to those expected taxable supplies (i.e. they have a direct and immediate link with them) or that they are overhead costs within the meaning set out in paragraphs 25 to 28 of <span style="font-style:italic">Sofology</span> recorded above.</p>

His oral testimony has been supported, at almost every turn, by the documentary evidence.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The company has been regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority since July 2006 and has maintained that status throughout the relevant period. It had both a commercial and regulatory business plan and, as regards its fund management activities, there is powerful evidence, in the form of the prospectus, to support Mr Patel’s evidence that this was intended to be a significant limb of its income generating activities. That prospectus is a professionally drafted document and the professional services firms identified in it are all significant players in the corporate finance arena. It would have taken a great deal of time, effort and cost to have concluded that prospectus, and we accept Mr Patel’s evidence that it was only pulled as a result of the Seychelles litigation, and the anxiety of the participants not to run any reputational risk which might arise from that litigation, and that the management time needed to conduct the litigation would prevent it focussing on fund management. These are all indicia of a trader which has a serious intention of undertaking significant commercial activity which will generate fees. It has not been suggested by HMRC that those fees might be exempt as they relate to financial services (broadly speaking). And we have not been addressed on the VAT status of fund management activities. But we are clearly of the view that such activities were carried out with the intention of generating income therefrom and it was circumstances which prevented the appellant from so doing. And had it not been for the Seychelles litigation, it is our view that the appellant would have undertaken its commercial activities as originally envisaged in its business plan and would have recovered its input VAT in the usual way.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">We have seen copies of the company’s accounts for a number of years. These are audited, and broadly speaking show income from two sources. The first is the Seychelles litigation which has been given, what is in essence a net present value of the anticipated damages, for the period in which the accounts were compiled reflecting the company’s view of the actuarial likelihood of recovering such damages. As we say, we were told that no invoices had been raised for these amounts yet we did see evidence that an invoice had been made out to HIL dated 31 August 2017 for $42,620.29. The second source of income evidenced by the accounts was, we were told, derived from foreign exchange gains and losses. To our mind prosecuting the litigation during those years was a commercial decision (and as things turned out justifiable one) which reflects a business which, having taken legal advice, took the view that they were likely to recover significant sums which, in turn, reflected work they had done in 2009, and which would also provide working capital for its ongoing and future activities. We will return to the significance of the invoice, in a moment.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The main activity conducted by the company during the relevant period focused on research advisory and introduction. Evidence of this ongoing activity is set out at length above and includes the emails relating to the introductions, the documents relating to those introductions, along with the confidentiality agreements, the conference attendances by Mr Patel and the marketing material produced for presentations. There was also the oral evidence of Mr Patel as to the extent of these activities. We accept this evidence as evidence of a genuine commercial activity being undertaken during the period of the Seychelles litigation in order to enable the company to generate income from exploiting the work done during that period once the litigation has ceased. Of course, there was some exploitation during the period in question as evidenced by the three invoices. But to our mind the significance of those invoices lies as much in the fact that taxable supplies were made in that period as evidence of intention to make such taxable supplies once the Seychelles litigation has concluded.</p>

And to support both activities, it undertook research through the agency of interns employed by the appellant. During the conduct of the Seychelles litigation, the appellant did not have the resources to fully pursue these introductory and advisory services, but the research it was undertaking has enabled it to keep itself up to date with the trends in the industry which is and was essential to enable it to give relevant advice at the appropriate time. Furthermore, as far as introductory services are concerned, it was obviously important to undertake some level of activity in order to keep its name “in the market” as it were and for Mr Patel to maintain his connections which could be exploited in earnest once the Seychelles litigation has concluded.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">But the appellant needs to go further. It needs to establish either that at the time the input tax was incurred, it was attributable to those expected taxable supplies, or that the input tax reflected overhead costs.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The evidence that we have seen makes it very difficult for us to come to a definite view on this, as we only have one quarters worth of financial information, namely the details of the input incurred for the period 09/17. This is unsurprising since this is, as far as we are aware, the only period for which the appellant was asked to provide that breakdown.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">That breakdown includes an item for rent (clearly in overhead) as well as what are likely to be regular expenses such as Microsoft subscriptions and network charges.

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">We are reluctant to come to a conclusion on this point, and in our view the most appropriate way of dealing with it is for the parties to review the inputs claimed by the appellant throughout the relevant period on the basis of the finding that throughout the period the appellant was an intending trader. It seems to us that the appellant and HMRC should readily be able to undertake such review and to reach an agreement as to the extent to which the inputs incurred during that period are either directly attributable to the appellant’s intending trade or (more likely we suspect) comprise overhead costs.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">There are two further matters on which we need to reach a conclusion. The first relates to legal fees. We were told that these were claimed in the 03/19 and 06/19 periods. There is no difficulty in identifying why these fees were incurred. They are legal costs associated with the ongoing Seychelles litigation. Although, as mentioned above, we were told that there was no actual invoice for the figures set out in the accounts representing the accounting view of the ongoing value of a likely damages award, there is the invoice dated 31 August 2017 for approximately $42,620.29 made out to HIL. The four invoices for legal fees all predate that invoice. We were told that even though the appellant may not have originally paid these invoices, the costs were ultimately borne by it, and the four invoices were certainly all made out to the appellant. In our judgment the input tax on the invoices for the legal fees has a direct and immediate link to the invoice of 31 August 2017, and the appellant is therefore entitled to recover that input tax.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, we turn to the question of the penalty assessment visited on the appellant on the basis that it had submitted carelessly inaccurate returns for the period 03/15 to 12/18.  The penalty assessment explains that the appellant’s careless behaviour was that it had continued to claim VAT as input tax when it has not made, nor demonstrated an intention to make, any taxable supplies, and that it had failed to take reasonable care in completing its VAT returns because it did not check with HMRC that this was acceptable. As we have found that the appellant was, throughout the relevant period, an intending trader, we take the view the appellant has not been careless as suggested by HMRC, and we allow its appeal against the penalty assessment.</p>
