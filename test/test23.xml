            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This is a dispute between two brothers about the ownership of a very valuable flat known as 106 Nottingham Terrace, London NW1 (“the Property”). The Property is a 4-bedroomed penthouse apartment opposite Regent’s Park. The claim was commenced by Part 7 Claim Form on 22 January 2020. It was tried before me over 4 days from 8 to 11 March 2022.</span></p>

          <content>
            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The Property is registered at HM Land Registry under title number NGL217917 in the sole name of the Defendant and has been so registered since 29 January 2014. It was acquired by the Claimant in his sole name in 1972 but was transferred to the Defendant by a transfer dated 24 January 2014 (“the 2014 Transfer”). Panel 8 of the 2014 Transfer, under the heading “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Consideration</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”, recorded that “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">the transfer is not for money or anything that has a monetary value</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”. However, it is no part of either party’s case that the Property was a gift from the Claimant to the Defendant and there is no plea by the Defendant of estoppel by deed in the Re-Amended Defence. Both parties agree that the transfer was intended to be for value. </span></p>

          <content>
            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The Claimant’s case is that he was the sole owner in equity of the Property from the date of acquisition but that there came a time, in or about 1990, when he orally agreed to transfer the Property to his brother for £400,000. His case is that he transferred the Property to the Defendant in 2014 in the mistaken belief that the Defendant had paid him the agreed figure of £400,000 and he seeks relief from the consequences of his mistake in equity and other relief. </span></p>

          <content>
            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The Defendant’s pleaded case is that the brothers were beneficial tenants in common in equal shares from the outset, despite the conveyance into the sole name of the Claimant, pursuant to a common intention constructive trust, and that he was therefore buying out the Claimant’s 50% interest. Further, his pleaded case is to the effect that whilst he does not recall the specifics of the arrangement or the agreed price, “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">the Claimant will have allocated a sum in one of the accounts of the many jointly owned companies, a director’s loan account, a trust account or similar device so as to account for the movement of a sum of money from the Defendant to the Claimant to reflect the transfer of the Claimant’s beneficial interest in the Property to the Defendant</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”. How, it might be asked, could the Claimant have mistakenly believed that he had been paid for the Property (if in fact he had not been paid) and how, it might be asked, could the Defendant have thought that he had paid without being able to identify precisely how and by what means he paid? There are a number of improbable features about both party’s cases but I repeat: no one alleges that the transfer was a gift. Ultimately, the Claimant has brought this case, and founds his claim on the central allegation that he mistakenly believed his brother had paid him for the Property when in fact he had not. In those circumstances, the burden is on the Claimant to prove the alleged mistake and the fact of non-payment. The other important issue concerns the alleged common intention constructive trust. There are, of course, other issues, but these are the central issues.</span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In setting out the factual background, I propose, at this stage, to recite the facts that are either agreed or uncontroversial and/or incontrovertible in the light of the evidence given at trial and/or the contemporaneous documents. That said, there are, as one might expect, significant disputes between the parties, in particular as to (i) the issue of common intention and/or the inferences that should be drawn as to what the parties’ common intention was in relation to the ownership of the Property (ii) what the terms of any agreement were in relation to the subsequent transfer of the Property from the Claimant to the Defendant (iii) whether the Defendant ever paid for the Property and if so how and if not (iv) whether the Claimant nonetheless mistakenly believed that he had been paid. I shall of course have to resolve those conflicts and make appropriate findings of fact, but for the moment I propose to set out the core background facts so as to provide the context for the later discussion and resolution of the key issues. </span></p>

Over the years he and his brother have been involved in numerous businesses. A schedule of directorships identified, as at February 1990, more than two dozen limited companies of which they were or had previously been directors. The pattern has generally been the same. The businesses have been owned on a 50:50 basis with both brothers acting as directors and drawing a salary. William has always been the dominant partner, making most of the important business decisions. However, this is not to diminish the role of Elias who, as William acknowledged, has been involved primarily on the operational side of the businesses. Both brothers were given a good start in life by their father who, together with his brothers, had been a very successful textile merchant and had provided his sons with the seed capital to get started in business.</span></p>

In particular, it appears to have been William who came up with the idea of a bank loan, secured against the Property, on the basis that the interest cost would be tax deductible. This appears from an exchange of emails on 24 September 2010 and this appears to have been the scheme that eventually found favour with Elias and William, albeit after a further period of delay, and it was a scheme that clearly required the Property to be in Elias’s name if he was to borrow money using the Property as security. </span></p>

The lending from Credit Suisse was then completed on or about 4 June 2015 and a charge in favour Credit Suisse was registered against the title to the Property on 14 July 2015. Until the present dispute arose, this appeared to mark the end of the story in relation to the Property and it is therefore appropriate for me to set out my overall impression of this course of correspondence, and what (if any) conclusions can be drawn from it.</span></p>

However, having reflected carefully on the course of correspondence that began in 1996 and culminated in the transfer of the Property from William to Elias in 2014, I have concluded that it is of limited value in resolving the central issues in this case. It does not contain any clear admission by William to the effect that he had been paid by Elias for his interest in the Property, still less any indication of how and when he had been paid, or that Elias was a co-owner in equity of the Property and if so, on what basis. It supports the contention that William </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">thought</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> that the Property now belonged to Elias but that is consistent with William’s case, based as it is on his alleged mistake in believing that he had been paid by Elias. </span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The accountants and tax advisers, and their clients William and Elias, were primarily concerned at this time with saving tax. I emphasise that I have seen nothing to indicate that the parties were engaged in anything other than legitimate tax avoidance. However, it is quite clear that that was the predominant focus of this lengthy course of correspondence. I have had careful regard to the totality of this correspondence but have decided that the correspondence alone is not as helpful as it might appear at first blush in helping me to resolve the conflicts of evidence that arise. All the participants seem to have been confused to some extent as to the underlying facts and it seems that the parties themselves were prepared to sanction almost any arrangement in relation to their property interests that ended up saving tax. It is therefore important not to take one piece of documentary evidence in isolation and give it undue weight. The documentary evidence needs to be considered alongside the other evidence, in particular the oral and written evidence of the protagonists in order to reach any reliable conclusions. Further, it is wrong to focus unduly on one particular period of time or one letter in isolation; one swallow does not make a summer (for either side). The whole body of evidence covering a period of almost 50 years has to be examined in order to discern the true picture and reach reliable conclusions on the facts. </span></p>

I do not propose to trawl through all the correspondence that followed but there are certain matters which I should mention. However, before dealing with those matters, there is another point to mention at this juncture. The year 2017 marked the beginning of what is now a spectacular falling out between two brothers who were hitherto incredibly close. The cause of this falling out appears to have been, not this dispute (which appears to have been a consequence of the falling out), but rather the perception on the part of William that Elias was being less than obliging in relation to the use by Tanya, William’s daughter, of 100 Nottingham Terrace, a property owned by Cedardrive Limited, which was rented by Tanya but which William wished to buy on her behalf. Elias suggested that this was the reason for the present dispute. He is almost certainly right. Indeed, William accepts that the issues in relation to Tanya “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">led me to question the relationship [with Elias] generally and … this made me consider the transfer of the Property and the fact that I had no recollection of him paying for it which … I had not questioned up to this point</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">” (§40, Witness Statement). However, I regard the precise reason for the current dispute as irrelevant, unless it is the case that this is a case based on revenge, as was put to William, rather than on the facts which William invites the Court to find. That will depend on my findings of fact. </span></p>

When asked whether Mr Zelouf was lying, he said “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">Yes</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">”. Elias said in evidence that Mr Zelouf was in fact just “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">a mouth-piece for William</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">” and not the honest broker he portrayed himself as. Earlier in the trial, in the course of his cross-examination of Mr Zelouf, Mr Winn-Smith had suggested to the witness that he had created the May 2019 Note shortly before he sent it to William on 2 July 2020. This was an allegation of fraud and/or dishonesty, which clearly took the witness by surprise, as it did the Court. I expressed concern at the time about the appropriateness of this suggestion, it being entirely unheralded by anything in the pre-trial preparations, and there being no suggestion (see e.g. CPR 32.19) that the May 2019 Note was anything other than authentic, and I remain concerned. Trial by ambush is not the way we proceed in this or any other jurisdiction, and advocates should not </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">make any allegation of fraud, unless they have clear instructions to allege fraud and reasonably credible material which establishes an arguable case of fraud</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">. I am not satisfied that there was any proper basis for impugning Mr Zelouf’s honesty and Mr Winn-Smith, to his credit, accepted that he had “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">overstepped the mark</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">”. This particular dispute of fact is one that I propose to resolve now. Mr Zelouf came across as an entirely honest and straightforward witness and I am satisfied that Mr Zelouf wrote the May 2019 Note more or less contemporaneously with events on 31 May 2019, and certainly within a few hours (at most) of his meeting with Elias on that date, and that it accurately reflects the content of his discussions with Elias, including what Elias said to him about the Property. </span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">William is 82 years old. He is the patriarch of the family. He is clearly a forceful personality and a very successful businessman. I am satisfied that at all material times to this action he has been a very wealthy man. He (and his brother) were given a very good start in life by their father who was also a very successful businessman. In particular, both brothers are beneficiaries of a Settlement dated 10 October 1970 which is administered in Guernsey. There are other family trusts, including the Fattal 1999 Trust. By 1990 I am satisfied that William had net worth of at least £5m, in all probability significantly more than that.  He said his net worth at that time was probably in the £5-10m bracket. I accept this evidence and it fits with the other evidence, in particular the sale of Roboserve in 1987 for £18m. This is relevant for reasons which will become clear later on in this judgment.  Sadly he has fallen out with Elias. He described the brothers as being engaged in a “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">5-year war</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">” and the evidence was that this is one of 4 ongoing legal cases between the brothers, possibly with more in store. Clearly this is a source of great regret to William but it was clear to me that he is currently in no mood for compromise and his evidence reflected this unfortunate background and was undoubtedly somewhat coloured by the “fog of war”. William clearly had a lot that he wanted to say, much of it irrelevant to this case. He found the process of cross-examination irksome and was frustrated that Mr Winn-Smith was following his own course of questioning, rather than engaging immediately with the witness on his witness statement. The result was that his evidence was often discursive, unfocused and unresponsive and I had to repeatedly remind him to answer the question. Indeed as time went on he seemed to be less concerned to answer the questions put to him and increasingly determined to tell the Court his views about the case and his brother regardless of whether there was any discernible link between the question and what he said. It follows from all this that I have approached William’s evidence with a degree of caution. William is first and foremost an entrepreneur and deal-maker and until the brothers began to fall out in 2017, I am satisfied that he trusted his brother implicitly and vice versa. I also formed the view that he was not a man for detail, particularly when it came to accounting matters, unless that detail related to (legitimate) means of avoiding or mitigating tax which seems to have been a predominant concern of both brothers. However, even then, he would leave the fine detail to his professional advisers. These facets of William’s character, and the nature of his relationship with his brother, are important, particularly when it comes to considering the plausibility of William’s contention that it was not until 2017 that he discovered that Elias had not in fact paid him for the Property. As I observed at the outset of this judgment, there are a number of improbable features about both parties’ cases, and I have approached William’s evidence in relation to the issues of payment (or not) and mistake with particular care. However, ultimately I have concluded that he was a reliable witness whose evidence I could largely accept, particularly on the important issues. Where his evidence conflicted with that of Elias, I prefer William’s evidence.</span></p>

I do not accept either party’s case on this issue. I accept that William was more involved in strategy and deal-making, whereas Elias was more involved in the operational side of their various businesses. However, it is a feature of this case that both William and Elias individually, and their various businesses, employed a variety of accountants, auditors, tax advisers and solicitors and generally relied quite heavily on professionals. In particular, WHC were responsible for auditing the various companies which the brothers ran and a book-keeper appears to have kept a fastidious hand-written ledger in relation to IEL, which was the main property-holding company operated by the brothers in the 1970s and 1980s, including details of all movements on the DLA of each brother. Thus, for example, costs or expenses referable to the Property were specifically identified as such in the ledger by use of the shorthand “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">106 NT</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”. Similarly, there appear to be reasonably complete records for Cedardrive Limited, the brothers’ main property development company, including records of all movements on the DLA of each brother for the whole of the 1990s. </span></p>

Indeed much of the confusion that arose in the minds of their lawyers, accountants and other professional advisers about the ownership of the Property in the run-up to the 2014 Transfer seems to have arisen because the primary focus was on potential tax mitigation measures rather than on the legal and/or beneficial interests in the Property. </span></p>

Elias’s evidence suffered from many of the same defects as his brother’s evidence, no doubt for many of the same reasons. The fog of war has clearly coloured his evidence too. Whilst in some instances, he was more willing to give short and direct answers to the questions asked, he also gave the very clear impression of having things which he wished to say and at times this deflected him from answering the question. His evidence also appeared markedly less fluent and natural than William’s evidence. What I conclude has happened at some points with Elias’s evidence, particularly on the important issues, is a particularly acute form of the situation which is not infrequently encountered, when a witness, during and in part because of the exercise of consideration inherent in the court's processes (pleadings, witness statements and so forth) has his recollection actually altered from what it would have been at the time. I am also satisfied that much of his evidence was speculation or wishful thinking, rather than being grounded in reality and referable to genuine recollection. </span></p>

The money to redeem the mortgage came from his private account at NatWest. It is more likely than not that the money came from the proceeds of sale of some of his Roboserve shares, not from the proceeds of sale of some unspecified company property (as Elias suggested), despite the apparent timing discrepancy that Mr Winn-Smith relied on by reference to the date upon which the relevant sale of shares was registered. That is consistent with a manuscript note apparently made by Mr Wilding on 6 October 1983. However, it does not ultimately matter. What matters is that the money used to redeem the mortgage came from William’s private bank account, not from any pooled or joint fund belonging to the brothers.

I am satisfied that Elias knows that he paid nothing towards the costs of acquisition or the costs of refurbishment of the Property and that had he done so, there would be some documentary evidence to prove that he had, notwithstanding the lapse of time. His lack of recall is not due to the passage of time; it reflects the reality that he paid nothing and knows he paid nothing but could not bring himself to admit this in evidence. His statement of case, referring as it does to “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">joint business ventures</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">” and “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">joint business accounts</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">”, is, in my judgment, deliberately opaque and again a reflection of the fact that Elias simply has no credible evidence to support his contention that he made a financial contribution to the acquisition of the Property. The fact that the brothers jointly owned and ran a number of companies, including the property investment company IEL, from which William drew a salary and borrowed money via his DLA, does not mean that anything bought by William with </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">his</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF"> money is somehow to be treated as bought from pooled funds or joint resources. I find as a fact that no pooled funds or joint resources were used in the acquisition or refurbishment of the Property. Elias cannot pierce the corporate veil and claim a beneficial interest in the Property on the basis that the ultimate source of William’s money was one of the various companies that he and his brother owned and controlled. On that basis William could probably claim an interest in 72/73 NT. William had his own money, Elias had his own money and each of the various companies which they jointly owned had its own money. Insofar as William borrowed money from, for example, IEL, to pay the deposit for the Property, this is taken to be William’s money. Insofar as William used money that he had received by way of dividend or salary from any company or from the sale of his shares, again this was his money. I am satisfied that William was intent on buying the Property for himself and used his own money to do so and am satisfied that Elias made no financial contribution to the acquisition or refurbishment of the Property. On the contrary, I find as a fact that William paid the entire costs of acquisition and refurbishment associated with the Property. Insofar as the 2014 Transfer suggests otherwise, there is no plea of estoppel by deed in the Re-Amended Defence and in any event the doctrine would not apply because this action is not an action brought to enforce rights arising out of the deed: see Chitty at §1-108 and the cases referred therein, e.g. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">Carpenter v Buller</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF"> (1841) 8 M &amp; W 209 at [213]. </span></p>

It seems to me to have been the least one might have expected giving that he was living in the Property rent-free for many years. I am prepared to accept that Elias was, at one stage in or about 1971 or 1972, keen to get on the property ladder himself but I am satisfied that the reason why he was content to relinquish any interest in Buttermere Court and did not pursue another purchase in his own right after the sale of Buttermere Court was due to inertia on his part and the fact that he was more than content to continue living with his brother in a large penthouse flat opposite Regent’s Park. It was emphatically </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">not</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF"> as a result of anything said or done by William or any arrangement, understanding or agreement in relation to the beneficial ownership of the Property. In fact, I am quite satisfied that this topic was never discussed and never needed to be discussed because, in this case, William’s actions made it quite clear what he intended, namely that this was to be his property, paid for by him, and Elias understood as much and was quite happy to go along with this arrangement. I find as a fact that there was no common intention to share the Property beneficially whether from the outset or at any stage subsequently and there is nothing in the whole course of dealing between the parties that would warrant either an inference that this was the intention from the outset or a change of intention thereafter. </span></p>

In advancing this latter submission, he pointed to the absence of documentary evidence generally and in particular the absence of William’s bank statements, the absence of any company ledgers for IEL for the period after 1989 and the absence of any trust documents (or only very few) relating to the various family trusts, it being Elias’s suggestion that these trusts were one of the possible sources from which William had been paid. </span></p>

The factual dispute in that case was how an employee came by an injury to his back when loading an industrial freezer onto the trailer of a lorry. He claimed that he had been required to lift the freezer to a height of about 4 to 5 feet to stack it onto refrigerators already loaded onto the lorry. The defendants claimed that he had only been required to lift the freezer a few inches so that although he had suffered the back injury claimed, there was no unsafe system of work. The Recorder at trial found the claimant to be an unimpressive witness who had been evasive and some of whose evidence had been contradictory. On the other hand he detected some closing of ranks and obfuscation on the part of the defence witnesses. The Recorder said he was unable to find that the claimant had proved his case and dismissed the claim. The Court of Appeal unanimously dismissed the appeal. Having cited the passage from </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Stephens v Cannon</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> that I have set out earlier, Auld LJ reduced the analysis to two main propositions:</span></p>

The burden of proof remains part of our law and practice – and a respectable and useful part at that – where a tribunal cannot on the state of the evidence before it rationally decide one way or the other. In this case the Recorder has shown, in my view, in his general observations on the unsatisfactory nature of the important parts of the evidence on each side going to the central issue, particularly that of Mr Verlander, that he had considered carefully whether there was evidence on which he could rationally decide one way or the other.”</span></p>

I have reminded myself that Elias’s case on payment takes in a number of possibilities (see </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">§27 of Re-Amended Defence) and in particular relies on </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">the suggestion (emanating from William) that Elias’s beneficial interest had been “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">reflected by entries in [the parties’] respective accounts”</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. However, I note too the observation of Mr Buzzoni that if Elias had indeed paid for the Property, “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Derek [Hudson] would almost certainly have reported the transaction for tax purposes”</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. The suggestion that it might have been accounted for by means of entries in the parties’ respective accounts is most likely to have been a reference to the DLAs in relation to Cedardrive Limited. The Court has copies of Elias’s DLA for Cedardrive Limited covering the period from 1990-1999 and 2003. There is no evidence of any debit or payment by Elias to William for the Property. The Court also has copies of the brothers’ DLAs for IEL and the position has been static since 1990. There were, of course, other companies but I am satisfied that any payment, had it been made in this way, is likely to have appeared in the DLAs in relation to Cedardrive Limited and there is no evidence of any payment, entry or other adjustment to reflect consideration passing from Elias to William for the Property. Further, I am unpersuaded that any important documents are missing. I was not told of any extant disclosure issues between the parties. Mr Winn-Smith mentioned the absence of any of William’s bank statements but it has never been Elias’s case that he paid William directly in this way. There was also a suggestion that the payment may have come via one of the family trusts but there is no evidence to support such a suggestion and, as noted above, there appears to have been no real effort by Elias or his solicitors to obtain supporting documents if Elias really believed that this was a live possibility. The fact that he made no such effort is demonstrative of the fact that he knows that this is not what happened. </span></p>

I accept that the brothers each trusted each other implicitly for more than 50 years; I accept too that William was the more dominant and forceful personality of the two, but I reject the suggestion that Elias was in any way naïve or unable to look after his own interests. That was not the impression I formed having seen him give evidence over an extended period and it is inconsistent with his background in business and his very considerable financial means, which include a substantial portfolio of valuable property held in either in his own or his wife’s name. </span></p>

I have resolved the factual issue under issue 5 against William. That was a central part of his misrepresentation claim but in any event, largely for the reasons set out by Mr Winn-Smith in his Skeleton Argument (</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">§§27-32 and §§75-83), I reject the misrepresentation claim. In particular, I am satisfied that this was a case of assumption on the part of William and passivity on the part of Elias, rather than misrepresentation (whether express or implied and whether by conduct or otherwise), and passivity and assumption are not generally enough because there is no general duty of disclosure: see e.g. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">Marme Inversiones 2007 SL v.

I have no doubt that the ordinary man on the street is most unlikely to have overlooked the fact that he had not received the agreed consideration of £400,000 and transferred real property in the mistaken belief that he had. However, I am satisfied that William is and was at all material times very far from being the ordinary man on the street. As he said in his witness statement (</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">§33)</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, evidence which I accept, “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">a transfer to me of £400,000 was not in those days that significant a sum to me in terms of my personal wealth at the time, and it isn’t really something I would have noticed, especially since most of my personal wealth and accounts were looked after by my accountants, advisers and trustees</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”. He was indeed very wealthy at this time. Further, his time, energy and attention was consumed by his business affairs and the various companies that he owned and controlled with his brother. I recall his observation in an email that “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">one tends to overlook one’s personal affairs in attending to business affairs</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”. I am satisfied that this is a case in point. Insofar as he had time for the brothers’ personal affairs, he appears to have been more interested in helping Elias to save tax than looking after his own interests. He also trusted his brother. The fact that William assumed Elias had paid and was only subsequently prompted to investigate the position following a falling-out with Elias over Tanya and the sale of 100 Nottingham Terrace is neither here nor there. There is no plea of estoppel by convention. Elias’s defence is that there was no mistake because he was in fact the beneficial owner of the Property having paid for it. The resolution of this issue is central to the disposition of the claim but ultimately, neither party devoted much time in their closing submissions to this issue and I see why – the resolution of this issue is largely dependent on my findings on issue 3. If Elias in fact paid William for the Property, there was clearly no mistake. If he did not, and there being no suggestion of a gift, the likelihood is that William executed the 2014 Transfer in the mistaken belief that Elias had accepted the Proposal and paid him for the Property and I so find. There is no other credible explanation for William’s execution of the 2014 Transfer. </span></p>

Thus where one person, A, transfers the legal title of a property that he owns to another, B, without receipt of any consideration, the effect will depend on his intention. If he intends to transfer the beneficial interest in the property to B, the transaction will take effect as a gift and A will lose all interest in the property. If he intends to retain the beneficial interest for himself, B will take the legal interest but will hold the property in trust for A. Normally there will be evidence of the intention with which a transfer is made. Where there is not, the law applies presumptions. Where there is no close relationship between A and B of the type that might give to a presumption of advancement, there will be a presumption that A does not intend to part with the beneficial interest in the property and B will take the legal title under a resulting trust for A. In the present case, there is no presumption of advancement as between William and Elias, and no evidence of an intention to make a gift; nor is there any evidence of any intention inconsistent with a trust. I am therefore satisfied that Elias holds the Property on presumed resulting trust. For completeness, I should also make it clear that I consider that the doctrine of presumed resulting trusts has not been abolished by s.60(3) LPA 1925: see </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Ali v Dinc</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> at </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">§§272-278.</span></p>

Applying the test of discoverability and the standard of reasonable diligence as recently explained by the Supreme Court, I am satisfied that William could with reasonable diligence have discovered his mistake by 22 January 2014 and there was therefore nothing to stop time running from that date: see e.g. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Test Claimants in the Franked Investment Income Group Litigation v HMRC</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> [2020] 3 WLR 139 at </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">§§193, 203, 209 and 213</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">. When I circulated this judgment in draft, I invited further written submissions as to whether the accounting period should not in fact start until April 2018, which I have determined as being the date upon which Elias knew that William had not been paid for the Property. Mr Winn-Smith, on behalf of Elias, submitted that “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">proprietary</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> trust remedies are not appropriate for the period prior to Elias’ conscience being affected</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">”, and suggested that the accounting period should not begin before April 2018. He also sought to rely on an unpleaded change of position defence in relation to the claim for an account. </span></p>

This, he submitted, would be consistent with the fact that William was, based on my conclusions above, entitled to personal remedies arising out of Elias’s unjust enrichment at his expense. In support of that submission, he referred me to </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11.5pt">Benedetti v Sawiris </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11.5pt">[2014] A.C. 938 at [13] and the basic principle underpinning such claims, namely that they are for the “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11.5pt">recovery of a benefit unjustly gained [by a defendant]…at the expense of the claimant</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:11.5pt">”.

Given my conclusions above, Elias had no beneficial right to any of the rental income from the Property; William was absolutely entitled to that income. It follows that on each occasion that Elias received and retained rent from the Property on or after 22 January 2014, he was unjustly enriched at William’s expense due to the mistake that William was labouring under. I agree with Mr Holland that in those circumstances William has a personal right to restitution for unjust enrichment against Elias, and I should make an order requiring Elias to disgorge the benefits he received from 22 January 2014, namely an order that he pay William the sums which represent the income, net of expenses, from the Property. As a result, an enquiry into the damages payable from 22 January 2014 is necessary. For completeness, I should also say that I regard it as far too late to rely on an unpleaded change of position defence. There was no investigation at trial as to the factual merits of such a defence, which is hardly surprising in the circumstances, and it is too late to embark upon such an investigation. Although Mr Winn-Smith made no formal application to amend, had a formal application for permission to amend been made, I would have refused it. </span></p>
