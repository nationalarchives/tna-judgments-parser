            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Taking matters shortly, the Applicant’s extradition was originally concerned with five European arrest warrants (EAWs) issued by the Greek judicial authorities (being the public prosecutors in Athens and Piraeus).  EAWs 1-4  related to alleged misconduct in the Applicant’s role as a judge, for which she was sentenced in her absence to varying terms of imprisonment. EAW5 contained accusation and conviction elements, relating to a series of offences over the period 2000–2004, in which the Applicant was said to have corruptly abused her position as a judge and otherwise acted improperly. </p>

The Court dismissed all the remaining grounds of appeal, save for two, which were left undecided: (a) whether the conditions in the prison in which the Applicant would be detained were so poor/overcrowded that extradition would be contrary to her rights under Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR); and (b) whether (in relation to the conviction part of EAW 5) extradition would constitute a disproportionate interference with the Applicant’s rights under Article 8 of the ECHR, having regard to the short sentence of imprisonment (24 days) to which the Applicant would be subject for the conviction offences following the ‘falling away’ of a number of offences and having regard to other periods which served to be deducted from the original sentence (see at [38] and the Second Judgment, [7]).</p>

All but one of the accusation offences were now time barred, having been transformed into ‘misdemeanours’. However, the Applicant could still be prosecuted for the one offence unaffected by the changes, the offence of money laundering. As to the conviction matter of (originally) 80 months, whilst this was also impacted by the new Penal Code, it did not become time barred until 12 November 2019. At the time of the application, therefore, the Applicant still had to serve the remaining 24 days of that sentence and would be liable to serve any sentence on the one outstanding accusation matter in the event she were convicted of it. </p>

I note that in her original extradition hearing, the district judge held that the Applicant’s evidence displayed ‘a high degree of manipulation’, also refusing to accept that she had ‘a rational fear of reprisal from Greek Government, judicial or business interests’. Those findings were recorded in the First Judgment (at [78]). The Court was unpersuaded by the Applicant’s case on extraneous considerations, saying, ‘there is nothing about the terms of the charges themselves, or the subsequent history of the proceedings, that suggests a political motivation on the part of the prosecutor or that the charges have been fabricated’ (at [77])<span style="font-style:italic">; </span>and as to fair trial rights: <span style="font-style:italic">‘</span>[t]here is no reliable evidence that the Court of Appeal in Athens will not hear the Appellant's case fairly and impartially’<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>([80]).

I do not know what his instructions were.  The fact is she was represented.   There is also the point, having regard to the question of injustice in Crim PR r 50.27, that the Applicant has waited nine months, and until virtually the eve of extradition, before seeking to re-open on the basis of her conviction.  There is no good reason for that delay.   I am tempted to conclude, as Mr Stansfeld submitted, that the matter was deliberately held back until the final moment so as to frustrate extradition (again).  </p>

There is no abuse of process here and there was no real attempt by the Applicant, as the authorities require, to specifically particularise what the alleged abuse was. An issuing judicial authority is not required to provide a running commentary on the prosecution process to the executing judicial authority, save perhaps where the EAW is withdrawn or otherwise falls away, so as to remove the basis for extradition entirely.   That is not the case here. </p>

Further, the remedy, a residual abuse of process jurisdiction, only arises where ‘the error or omission is material to the operation of the statutory scheme’. The Applicant has not demonstrated any such materiality. When she was convicted in February 2022 the extradition proceedings had come to an end.</p>

The human rights bars in ss21 and 21A, and the extraneous consideration bar in s13 of the 2003 Act should be fully presented and resolved in the extradition proceedings.
