        <p>Section 31 of the Local Government Act 2003 (“the Act”) enables the Welsh Ministers to pay grants to local authorities towards expenditure incurred, or to be incurred, by them.</p>
        <p>The list of bodies included as a local authority for the purposes of that section is set out in section 33 of the Act.</p>
        <p>These Regulations amend section 33 to add corporate joint committees established under Part 5 of the Local Government and Elections (Wales) Act 2021 to the list of local authorities to which the Welsh Ministers can pay grants under section 31 of the Act.</p>
        <p>The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Local Government Policy Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff CF10 3NQ.</p>
