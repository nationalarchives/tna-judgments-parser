        <p>In relation to Wales, the non-domestic rating multiplier for each chargeable financial year is calculated in accordance with Part A2 of Schedule 7 to the Local Government Finance Act 1988 (“the 1988 Act”).</p>
        <p>Where regulations made under paragraph A16 of Schedule 7 to the 1988 Act (calculation of differential multipliers) apply in respect of a hereditament, a differential multiplier determined by the Welsh Ministers in regulations applies in respect of that hereditament, calculated by reference to the formula in paragraph A16(1). The formula requires M to be multiplied by N, where M is the non-domestic rating multiplier for the chargeable financial year under paragraph A14 or A15, and N is a number prescribed by the Welsh Ministers in regulations.</p>
        <p>The Non-Domestic Rating (Description of Differential Multipliers) (Wales) Regulations 2025 (“the 2025 Regulations”) specify the hereditaments on a local non-domestic rating list by reference to their description and range of rateable values, to which a retail multiplier and a higher multiplier will apply. They also specify the range of rateable values shown against the name of a designated person on the central non-domestic rating list to which a higher multiplier will apply.</p>
        <p>These Regulations prescribe the values of those differential multipliers by designating values to N. The value of N for the purpose of the retail multiplier described by regulation 3 of the 2025 Regulations is 0.697. The value of N for the purpose of the higher multiplier described by regulations 4 and 5 of the 2025 Regulations is 1.026. This has the effect of setting the retail multiplier and the higher multiplier, respectively, at 30.3% below and 2.6% above the non-domestic rating multiplier for the relevant financial year.</p>
        <p>The Welsh Ministers’ Code of Practice on the carrying out of Regulatory Impact Assessments was considered in relation to these Regulations. As a result, a regulatory impact assessment has been prepared as to the likely costs and benefits of complying with these Regulations. A copy can be obtained from the Non-Domestic Rates Policy and Reform Division, Welsh Government, Cathays Park, Cardiff, CF10 3NQ.</p>
