        <p>These Regulations are the fifth commencement regulations bringing into force provision in the Levelling-up And Regeneration Act 2023 (c. 55) (“the Act”).</p>
        <blockList>
          <listIntroduction>The provisions of the Act specified in regulation 2 come into force on 1st November 2024. Those provisions are—</listIntroduction>
          <item>
            <num>(a)</num>
            <p>section 237 (childcare: use of non-domestic premises), and Schedule 23 (use of non-domestic premises for childcare registration) as introduced by that section; and</p>

          <item>
            <num>(b)</num>
            <p>section 238 (childcare: number of providers).</p>
          </item>
        </blockList>
        <p>The provision brought into force by these Regulations amends Part 3 of the Childcare Act 2006 (c. 21) (“the 2006 Act”) (regulation of provision of childcare in England).</p>
        <tblock class="group1">
          <heading>Heading here</heading>
          <blockList>
            <listIntroduction>Section 237(1) of the Act amends the definitions of “early years childminding” and “later years childminding” in sections 96(4) and (8) of the Childcare Act 2006 respectively (those provisions coming within Part 3 of the 2006 Act), by removing the requirement that at least half of the provision must be provided on domestic premises. Subsection (2) introduces Schedule 23 (use of non-domestic premises for childcare registration) which makes further amendments to Part 3 of the 2006 Act relating to the registration of persons providing childminding wholly on non-domestic premises.</listIntroduction>
            <item>
              <num>(a)</num>
              <p>List item one</p>

              <p>Second list item</p>
            </item>
          </blockList>
          <p>Section 238 amends sections 96(5) and (9) of the 2006 Act, substituting the word “three” with “four”. The effect of this change is to increase the number of other childminders or assistants that childminders may work with from two to three (four people in total). It also increases, from four to five, the minimum number of people that must work together to provide “childcare on domestic premises” (provision that would be childminding, at least some or all of which is on domestic premises, but for the operation of sections 96(5) and (9) of the Childcare Act 2006).</p>
          <p>The Schedules to these Regulations make transitional provision in relation to the provision these Regulations bring into force.</p>
