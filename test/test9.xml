By 1994 she was in her mid-80s and in poor health.  The respondent was in her late 20s and had two young children.  Since May 1992 she had been the appellants' tenant at premises at 57A Aboyne Drive, a two-bedroomed maisonette.  She wanted to obtain a tenancy of larger premises, but knew that the scarcity of properties was such that she was unlikely to be able to upgrade under the appellants' transfer scheme for current tenants.  She appreciated, as the judge put it, that the only realistic method of securing an alternative council house would be by finding another tenant of a larger home willing to exchange homes with her.  The appellants operated a mutual exchange scheme, the details of which were fully explained to the judge and by the judge in his judgment.  The new tenancy was granted to the respondent on the basis that she was exchanging homes with Mrs Mahon.  It would not have been granted had the appellants been aware that Mrs Mahon did not intend to move into the premises then tenanted by the respondent.</span></p>

The respondent and Mrs Mahon each signed the necessary tenancy exchange application forms.  The respondent gave her form to her mother.  Mrs Cowper short-circuited normal procedures and took the tenancy agreements to Mrs Mahon and to the respondent to sign.  Mrs Mahon signed the agreement, but made it clear to Mrs Cowper that she had no intention of moving to Aboyne Drive and was going to live in Lowestoft, whither she moved on or shortly after 17th February 1994.

She displayed no compunction whatever about her dealing, as a Council Officer, with her own personal details on the Council's computer system despite the obvious scope for abuse.  She did not think her own mother was acting anything other than 'objectively' when approving payment of a decorating allowance to her for Aboyne Drive, despite (again) the evident scope for abuse.  She did not take the opportunity she had had at interview in the police station to give her own account.  The circumstances of her own visit (with mother, children and partner) to Lowestoft in Autumn 2000 to track down and see Mrs Mahon do her no credit.  In short, if the Defendant's evidence had been the only evidence supporting her account of what occurred in the early stages of the mutual exchange transaction in early 1994, I would not have found it a wholly satisfactory basis on which to make findings as to where the truth lay."</span></p>

Notwithstanding all the other reservations I have (and have earlier expressed) as to her evidence generally, I cannot confidently find that she did know.

Counsel submits that the word should be construed broadly, because the purpose of ground 5 is to ensure that tenancies are not granted on the basis of false information.  If a tenant asks someone else to act on her own behalf, the risk of that person being dishonest is intended to be on the tenant.  Moreover, it is submitted, if a daughter makes no attempt to dissuade her mother from acting on her behalf, that amounts to instigation within the meaning of ground 5.</span></p>

It is true that sub-paragraph (b) could have, but does not, state "making a false statement at the tenant's instigation".  However, the expression as a whole clearly links the instigation with the false statement, in my view.  Moreover, the word "instigate" fits more comfortably in this context with action to promote a specific act, than with a general instruction to act.  In my judgment, the judge adopted the right approach to the word instigate.</span></p>

This says that the Recorder did not sufficiently take account of the council tax entries which Miss Richards wrongly made and which should have had a determining effect on his assessment of her credibility and honesty.  The terms of these council tax entries may convenient be found at page 293 of the bundle and are, so far as material, in the following terms.  There was a council tax entry which said "has done ME" (meaning mutual exchange) "Mrs M says her son will be decorating and getting the prop ready for her to mve into while she stays with daughter in the North."  Of the same date was a letter drafted by Miss Richards in these terms:</span></p>

If the judge had addressed them properly they were so startling that the complicity with her mother's dishonesty was difficult to avoid.  I do see that the general impropriety of Miss Richards making council tax entries in which she was personally involved was an element from which the judge might have inferred her complicity with her mother.  But the judge did not in fact do so.  The point was there to be made.  But I do not see how these council tax statements can be said to have induced the grant of the tenancy by the housing department, when there was no evidence or probability that the council tax department would communicate the entries to the housing department which was in a different building.  Nor do I see that these statements are so startling or laughable as to indicate probable complicity by Miss Richards with her mother.  The property into which Mrs Mahon was supposedly to move may have been lovely, but people who move into a property for the first time often have some redecoration done, even if the general state of the property is good.  I do not see that it should be regarded as odd even if an elderly lady moving house should go to stay with her relations in Lowestoft whilst some decoration is done to her new home.  Further, the Recorder did take these matters into account in assessing Miss Richards' credibility (see paragraphs 94, 106 and 105).</span></p>

I grant that his main conclusion may perhaps be seen as somewhat surprising, but the Recorder dealt with proper balance and at length with the evidence of each of the witnesses.  He addressed the case which the council made.  He faced up to the decision that he had to make as to whether Miss Richards was complicit in her mother's dishonesty.  He weighed her evidence properly, noting the points of weakness in it.  His critical judgment was an assessment of credibility after hearing and properly considering all the material oral evidence.  The Recorder, in my judgment, properly assessed his central task when he said in paragraph 150 of his judgment that his assessment of Miss Richards and her evidence:</span></p>

The assessment has been a difficult process - requiring careful reflection on the Defendant's demeanour and disposition in giving her live evidence before me taken together with the contents of her statement and the adverse inferences I have already drawn in respect of some of her evidence."</span></p>

In any event, the judge found that there was no instigation in this case as a matter of fact.  Mrs Cowper did what she did off her own bat.
