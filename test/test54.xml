            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The court is concerned with the father’s application under the 1980 Hague Convention (‘the Convention’) for the return of X (11 years old) and Y (5 years old) to the jurisdiction of Mauritius.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mother accepts that on 6 October 2022 the children were wrongfully removed from Mauritius to England within the terms of the Convention. The mother resists an order for the return of the children forthwith to Mauritius, as required by Article 12 of the Convention, relying on the defences of grave risk of harm and/or intolerability under Article 13 (1)(b) and the child’s objections under Article 13 (2).</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As well as considering the documents in the trial bundle, the court heard the oral evidence on Ms Callaghan, the Cafcass officer who met the children and prepared a report on their wishes.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before turning to consider the evidence, I would like to make a general point about the length of statements in abduction proceedings. In many of these cases such statements are far too long. In this case the mother’s statement was 33 pages, 82 paragraphs with 90 pages of exhibits. The father’s was 26 pages, 61 paragraphs with 80 pages of exhibits. The current Child Abduction Practice Guidance describes at paragraph 3.7 that such witness statements should be <span style="font-style:italic">‘as economical as possible and should deal only with those factual matters raised in the answer. </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold">The court will rarely be assisted by a detailed account of the history of the parents’ relationship.’</span><span style="font-style:italic"> </span>[emphasis added] The strictures of the Practice Guidance had not been applied in this case. The length of the statements and the number of exhibits, many of which were barely referred to, resulted in this case having a bundle that exceeded the PD27A page limit. No permission was sought to do so. Parties to abduction proceedings should re-acquaint themselves with the Practice Guidance and make sure the provisions in paragraph 3.7 provide the guiding framework for any statement filed in these proceedings.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The father ran a recruitment consultancy business that went into liquidation in 2014 in circumstances that are disputed between the parents. The father states it was due to high interest rates, the mother alleges it was due to the father’s financial mis-management. This had an impact on the family lifestyle and properties they owned had to be sold and money borrowed from family and elsewhere. Following that there are cross allegations by the parents regarding the family finances. The father states that due to the financial difficulties they decided in about 2019 to relocate. They discussed moving to Singapore after spending time with the mother’s parents in Mauritius. He accepts he made initial enquiries with schools and homes they could live in in Singapore but says the move did not take place due to the mother insisting they had <span style="font-style:italic">‘£140,000 in our account before moving to Singapore’.</span> The mother says the plan to move to Singapore was more certain when they left England in 2019 and the main reason for the stay in Mauritius was to enable her to renew her Mauritian passport, which could only be done in person. Events then overtook with the Covid travel restrictions and the parties’ separation in November 2020. The mother states the intention was not to stay in Mauritius long term. According to the father once they were in Mauritius the mother wanted to stay there, he agreed and they decided to stay with the maternal grandparents until they could purchase their own home which, he says, he engaged in correspondence about in May, August and September 2021. He says his second company <span style="font-style:italic">‘has been very successful, and I believe this is largely due to the move to Mauritius, which allows me to work effectively within the time zone of southeast Asia’.</span></p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In Mauritius the family initially lived with the maternal grandparents until the parents’ separation in November 2020, when the father went to live with his mother. The father continued to have contact with Y seeing him every weekend. After the separation X only participated in indirect video-call contact, which stopped in in about November 2021.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In June 2022 the father had instigated court procedures in Mauritius to seek contact with X. He made a ‘request to the court’ on 7 June 2022 and on 10 June 2022 both parties attended court-based mediation, where the parties agreed when the father came to the home to collect Y he would see X for up to 30 minutes. According to the father, that arrangement did not work with X and he was in the process of making a formal court application when he received the letter from the mother’s English solicitors dated 7 October 2022 stating she had left with the children.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his statement the father refers to a message from the mother in August 2022 confirming that Y will be attending the same school as X from January 2023. He sets out in his statement the financial support he has provided for the mother and the maternal grandmother, which is disputed by the mother. The father denies being abusive to the mother either prior to them being in Mauritius and also since their arrival there. According to the father his position was made difficult in the maternal grandparents’ home after he reconciled his relationship with his own mother in January 2020. He considered the mother was aggressive to him and he moved out as the environment had become <span style="font-style:italic">‘toxic’.</span></p>

This is principally relied upon to demonstrate that the father’s protective measures regarding financial support need to be considered with some caution due to this background. The mother also alleges the father exerted control over her by the way he managed the family finances and took unilateral steps without her knowledge. The father denies the allegations. He accepts the difficulties in some of the businesses but denies it was as a result of his behaviour and was more to do with external circumstances at the time.</p>

It can be lodged by either party and the judge does not review the basis of the foreign judgment other than whether any of the undertakings offered are contrary to public order. In her report she stated the time frame for such an order to be made could be 6 months to two years. Following questions from the parties she revised this timeframe to about two weeks if there was no opposition to what is sought stating <span style="font-style:italic">‘The judge would generally grant the order on the same day’</span> although continued <span style="font-style:italic">‘In some circumstances, especially if the application requires some clarification, the judge may take time to consider the application before granting the Order.’</span></p>

When asked about the school in Mauritius she responded that it was <span style="font-style:italic">‘good’</span> before then returning to describing school here. She described Mauritius as <span style="font-style:italic">‘..like a holiday place, not a place where you live all your life, England is my home, I was born here, and it is exciting to be back. In Mauritius once you have seen everything, there is nothing more to see’.</span> When asked how she feels about going to back to Mauritius she replied <span style="font-style:italic">‘I don’t want to go back to Mauritius, I am at home here and able to do the stuff that I love and to learn and go to places I enjoy’</span>. She continued in relation to Mauritius <span style="font-style:italic">‘In Mauritius it is really warm, but it is nice to have different weather, even when it is sometimes cold’.</span> She described the house in Mauritius as <span style="font-style:italic">‘nice and had a garden but there are two houses, with my grandparents in one and my aunt and uncle and two cousins in the other’</span>. X referred to an incident when she alleges the father took her and Y from her aunt’s house describing him coming and taking them and then he <span style="font-style:italic">‘sat me down and screamed at me, he is like that even when he is on the phone, he would get angry and make me scared. I would shut myself away after seeing his scary face’</span>. X then described an incident when she says she witnessed the father physically assaulting her mother, describing how she felt <span style="font-style:italic">‘it made me really scared……I was worried that my mum was going to fall, I was terrified’</span>. X said if she had a choice <span style="font-style:italic">‘Í would never see or speak to him again’.</span></p>

A few times a week it would happen and even after he left, he would get angry on the phone’</span>. X referred to a conversation she said she had with her father when she was seeing him in the garage  and he talked about <span style="font-style:italic">‘twisting nipples and the Squid game, which was banned by my school’</span> and he said she should not tell her mother. X described the sleeping arrangements at the maternal grandparents’ home in Mauritius, where she said she heard her parents fighting and <span style="font-style:italic">‘went to sleep with them to stop the fighting, so nothing would happen to mum’</span>, she continued that <span style="font-style:italic">‘now we have our own bedrooms and don’t have to share’</span>. When asked about her maternal grandparents X responded <span style="font-style:italic">‘my grandmother is really nice and really cares about us’</span>, then said <span style="font-style:italic">‘I don’t want to go back to Mauritius, even if it is nice, I like my country (England) and I don’t want to see him (her father), he is a bully, like when he sat me down and shouted at me, he screamed at me ‘I am your father’. Also, because Mauritius is a holiday place, England is my home, there are so many places I enjoy here, it is not nice being taken away from your home’</span>. In her oral evidence Ms Callaghan considered if the details X gave related to her own experiences of her father and if she had witnessed these incidents it would have impacted on X’s emotional wellbeing. X said she didn’t want to go back to Mauritius because her father is there and described him as a bully. When asked she said she did not miss anything about Mauritius describing it as <span style="font-style:italic">‘alright but I love it here’</span>. X agreed she knew about the trip to England beforehand.</p>

X considered this jurisdiction to be safer and to be her home. Mr Jarman submits the evidence demonstrates X objects to a return to Mauritius, she is of an age where her wishes should be considered and any return to Mauritius would present a grave risk of harm to her physical and emotional wellbeing.

Even if the allegations of domestic abuse are taken at their highest she submits they need to be considered in the context of the parties separation in November 2020, the fact that the father had contact with the children by agreement with the mother without any involvement of the court until June 2022 and there are no allegations of incidents between the parties post-dating the separation. </p>

She submits the statement reads more like a statement in financial proceedings rather than child abduction. Even if what the mother states is taken as its highest, the concerns about financial issues in the context of these abduction proceedings are met by the protective measures offered and the wider issues relating to financial matters will be considered by the competent court in Mauritius. </p>

In any event, she submits even if X’s views could amount to an objection the factors relevant to the exercise of discretion point heavily and decisively towards a return.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is clear from the differing accounts in the parties’ witness statements many of the allegations made by the mother about the financial history of the parties relationship and her allegations of domestic abuse are disputed. What the court has got to focus on within these proceedings is whether either separately or together the matters relied upon by the mother satisfy the requirements of Article 13 b. The court cannot determine all the issues in dispute. It needs to look at the matters relied upon in that context, consider all of the protective measures on offer, taking the allegations at their highest, and determine whether, in those circumstances, there will be such a grave risk that the return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm, or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation. In my judgment they do not. The mother’s defence under Article 13 b is not established for the following reasons:</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel8" style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.08in">In relation to the financial issues, they are mainly historical. Whilst the court should consider them at their highest, it is clear there are many issues about the financial circumstances between the parties. There is some scepticism about the father’s financial contribution in the recent past, as the limited documents relied upon by him do not provide a clear picture of regular financial support, which lends support to the mother’s account of his recent financial unreliability.  The father’s position is his business is doing very well and he can support the family financially. In my judgment the package of protective measures put forward by the father, including the arrangements that need to be in place prior to departure, ameliorate any risk caused by the father’s alleged financial unreliability, subject to the observations on the protective measures below.</p>

They are serious and concerning allegations, which may need to be investigated by any court considering welfare issues. For the purposes of this application, the court needs to consider them at their highest but also factor in the wider context, such as the lack of recent allegations after the parties separated in November 2020 and that the parties were able to continue making arrangements for contact post separation. If X is right, she has witnessed some of the alleged incidents between her parents and has been the subject of abusive behaviour by the father directed towards her and  she is likely to have suffered psychological harm. Whilst denying many of the allegations, the father accepts there have been occasions when the parents have argued and X has been present. Recognising these allegations are serious and are likely to have had an impact on X, the range of protective measures will ameliorate that risk as they mean X will remain in the care of her mother, in separate accommodation and will not be required to have any contact with the father without the agreement of the mother or an order of the court in Mauritius. In addition, these protective measures will be in a form that is enforceable, if required.</p>

In her meeting with Ms Callaghan X did object to returning to Mauritius, although it was in the context of her clear preference to remain living here for the reasons she gave. I agree with Ms Callaghan X is likely to have aligned herself with the mother, although Ms Callaghan did not detect any sign of her having been coached. It is of note that even though X objected, she was able to say some positive things about Mauritius and clearly connected the return there to seeing her father, which she did not want to do. Although finely balanced, I am satisfied that the threshold has just been crossed and X does object to a return. I recognise her objection is closely aligned with her views about her father, but it is difficult in the circumstances of this case to separate the two.</p>
