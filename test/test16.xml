The action was commenced by Mr. Syed Ul Haq, but he sadly died in 2017, and the action has since been pursued by Mrs Ashraf, in her capacity as executrix of the estate of Mr. Ul Haq.  For ease of reference I will refer to the estate of Mr. Ul Haq, as represented by the Claimant, as the “Estate”.  I will refer to Mr. Ul Haq himself as “the Deceased”.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Estate appeals, with the permission of Marcus Smith J., against an order made by Deputy Master Lloyd on 13<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019 (sealed on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2019).  By his order (“the Order”) the Deputy Master acceded to the applications of, respectively, the First and Second Defendants and the Seventh Defendant for summary judgment on the claims brought against them by the Estate in this action, and dismissed those claims.  The Estate was also ordered to pay the costs of the First and Second Defendants, and of the Seventh Defendant, and of the Fifth Defendant which also attended the hearing of the summary judgment applications.  In the case of the First Defendant and the Second Defendant the Estate was ordered to pay the costs on the indemnity basis.  In the case of the Seventh Defendant the Estate was ordered to pay the costs on the indemnity basis as from 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July 2018.</p>

The Applications were both made subsequent to the bringing of the Appeal.  By an order of 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> April 2021 Deputy Master Hansen directed that the Application of the Fifth Defendants should come on for hearing and determination immediately after the Appeal.</p>

The freehold title to the Property is registered under title number MX389787.  Until 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> June 2011 the registered proprietor of the Property was the Deceased.  The registered proprietors of the Property then became the Fourth Defendants, Mr. Bavinder Singh and Mrs Sonia Nijjar, who acquired the Property from the Bank of Scotland plc in 2013, selling as mortgagee of the Property.

I will use the expression “the 2010 TR1” to refer to the actual form of transfer by which, whether validly or not, the 2010 Transfer was expressed to be effected.

The Second Defendant witnessed the signature of the person who signed the 2010 TR1 in the name of the Deceased.  I will refer to the person who signed the 2010 Transfer in the name of the Deceased as “the Signatory”, again without making any decision as to whether the Signatory was the Deceased or some other person impersonating the Deceased. </p>

The Estate contends that its claims against the First, Second, and Seventh Defendants were unsuitable for summary judgment, that the Deputy Master made extensive findings of fact which were not open to him on a summary judgment application, and that the Deputy Master was in no position to decide and should not have decided that there was no real prospect of the Estate establishing, at trial, that the relevant Defendants did not owe any duty of care to the Deceased.  As such, the Estate seeks an order dismissing the applications which were before the Deputy Master, and its costs of the applications and the Appeal.  There is also a separate appeal against the costs orders made by the Deputy Master, so far as the Deputy Master awarded costs on the indemnity basis against the Estate, and so far as the Deputy Master required the Estate to pay the Fifth Defendant’s costs of attending the hearing of the applications before the Deputy Master (“the Hearing”).

The indemnity is sought pursuant to Section 103 of the Land Registration Act 2002, and paragraph 1(1)(b) of Schedule 8 to that Act.  In response to this claim, the CLR, if and to the extent held liable on the indemnity claim, makes its own additional claim for contribution against the LDS and the Seventh Defendant, on the basis of an entitlement to enforce any rights of action which the Estate may be found to have against LDS and the Seventh Defendant. </p>

The Bank also held a charge over a property at 35 Inglis Road, Ealing, London W5 3RL, which was also owned by the Deceased.

Mr. Attarian was purchasing the Property with the assistance of a loan from the Bank, to be secured by a registered charge over the Property (“the Attarian Charge”).

An important consequence of this is that the funds provided for the purchase were dealt with by FLP.  There was no other firm of solicitors involved in the 2008 Transaction, through whose hands the purchase funds also passed.    </p>

I am not sure that this figure is correct, given that the mortgage loan was £1.125 million.  For present purposes however the relevant point is that while the mortgage monies were under the control of FLP in their client account, the monies were misappropriated.  It is said that the mortgage monies were misappropriated by a Mr. Uddin, an employee of FLP, who was subsequently sent to prison for this offence.  For the Estate, Mr. Brown’s position was that this was the first of two frauds, in relation to both of which the Deceased was the victim. </p>

He said that he would use endeavours to obtain the replacement Transfer and that he would be able to sign the replacement Charge Deed. Once I had a copy of the form of charge I would write to him.

This is something of a comfort and I did go through the documents which I had on the Attarian file and the only document which I have bearing the signatures of Ul Haq and Attarian is a photocopy of an undated and unwitnessed Transfer and the signatures on the original Deeds which I now have do appear to be the same. However, I have to be careful about this case and I first of all telephoned Lester Dominic Solicitors to speak with Mr. Kan who had witnessed the Ul Haq signature.

FLP had failed to discharge the Charge and pay the redemption monies due on Mr. Ul Haq's Account and he thus remained liable on his personal covenants. Consequently it seemed to me that he ought now to be considering making an application to the Compensation Fund. It was not for me to advise him but he had to know what his liabilities were and if he was intending to do that he may well need the services of a Solicitor. He had previously seen Lester Kan who witnessed his signature on the replacement Transfer Deed and I am wanting him to make arrangements to see Mr. Kan again and produce evidence of his identity by way of for example his original Passport.

Ms. Hind explained that the Bank had been holding back until Mr. Attarian had co-operated with his application for compensation to the Solicitors Compensation Fund, that this had now happened, and that the Bank needed to press on with registration because Mr. Attarian’s account was seriously in arrears.</p>

Box 12 of the application form stated that evidence of identity was required where a person signing a disposition such as a transfer was not represented by a conveyancer.  In box 13 of the application form Mr. Kilvert identified the Deceased as having been represented by a conveyancer.  The conveyancer was identified as FLP.   This had the consequence that the second part of box 13, which required confirmation of identity in relation to a party not represented by a conveyancer, was left blank.</p>

He did say, however, that if I could drop him a line with details of his address etc. then he would use his best endeavours to contact Mr. Ul Haq and ask him to attend his offices to produce evidence of identity.

As is not unusual, we circulate the draft document and the parties via the defendants have provided observations on that. Bear in mind that this is litigation that is already on foot so we do not go back to pre-action correspondence whereby we set out a case and it is dealt with in that way. We only set out a draft document. The defendants can say why it is objectionable or not for various reasons. We are entitled to consider, as indeed one would expect, their observations in respect of all of that. I am not wedded to this draft Particulars of Claim. If indeed there are points that need properly to be clarified, then we will clarify them. Our interest is ensuring that my client’s case is properly put forward rather than them being effectively seeing these are technical objectors as to this, that, and the other, all of which are capable of resolution by way of case management. That was a long answer but my short answer to my Lord’s question is, yes, we intend to apply to amend. Is it going to be identical to the format of this draft: no, it will be clarified further, in due course, and we will circulate that, and we will move that application at the CMC, and I have consistently said that.”</span></p>

There is an extensive draft re-amendment of the Estate’s pleaded case in existence, in the form of the RPOC, but there is no application to re-amend, and the actual final form of the re-amended statement of case of the Estate is not known, and cannot yet be known.  I do not directly criticise Mr. Brown for reserving the Estate’s position in this respect, but the net result of this is that if and when application for permission to re-amend may come to be made, the proposed re-amendments could, in theory, be in a very different form to the RPOC.  It also struck me as significant that elements of the RPOC had been seized upon by the Defendants, in support of their various summary judgment/strike out applications.  It was hard to avoid the impression that the Estate’s reluctance to pin its colours to the mast of the RPOC was, at least in part, because parts of the RPOC had turned out to be unhelpful in its resistance to the summary judgment/strike out applications.</p>

The case arose out of a fire which occurred in a luxurious timber house which was under construction.  The fire caused substantial damage.  The building owners sued the main contractor, who in turn commenced third party proceedings against another party, who in turn commenced fourth party proceedings against another involved party, who in turn commenced fifth party proceedings against another involved party.  The action was therefore a multi-party action.  The building owners sought summary judgment against the main contractor.  One of the arguments deployed by the main contractor was that it was inappropriate to give summary judgment for the claimants in multi-party litigation, when the factual evidence was unclear and the position of other parties down the line was unknown.  At first instance the building owners were successful in obtaining summary judgment on liability, for damages to be assessed, but this result was overturned by the Court of Appeal on several grounds.  In explaining his decision to allow the appeal, Jackson LJ, with whose judgment the other members of the Court of Appeal agreed, said this in the concluding part of his judgment:   </p>

Also I think it was inappropriate to do so when similar issues remained to be determined at a full trial as between the other parties. In the particular circumstances of this case that constitutes a “compelling reason” not to enter summary judgment within the meaning of CPR r.24.2(b) . A judge in multi-party litigation must aim to do justice as between all parties involved in the case.</span></p>

There is going to be a trial anyway at which extensive factual and expert evidence will be called in order to establish: (a) what caused the fire; and (b) who is responsible. The claimants will have to participate in the trial, because they need to prove the quantum of their damages.</span></p>

My conclusion is simply that, for a collection of reasons as stated above, this case falls short of satisfying the requirements of CPR r.24.2 .”</span></p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The pleaded claim against Rees Page is that they owed a duty of care to the Deceased, when submitting the 2010 TR1 and the Attarian Charge for registration, to take reasonable care to establish that the 2010 TR1 had been properly executed by the Deceased; see paragraph 58 of the Amended Particulars of Claim.  Various alleged facts and matters are then set out in the sub-paragraphs of paragraph 58, which are said to support the case that Rees Page owed the duty of care to the Deceased.  The duty of care is alleged to have arisen only in the tort of negligence.  There is no claim in contract or for breach of trust or on the basis of any other cause of action.  The basis and content of the duty of care are further pleaded in paragraphs 59-60 of the Amended Particulars of Claim.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Breach, causation, and loss are pleaded in paragraphs 61-65 of the Amended Particulars of Claim.  In summary, it is alleged that Rees Page breached the duty of care which they owed to the Deceased by making the application for registration without taking adequate steps to obtain evidence as to the identity of the person who had signed the 2010 TR1 and/or without informing the Deceased of the application when it was made.  The pleaded case is that if this negligence had not occurred, the forgery of the 2010 TR1 would have come to light, the Deceased would have objected to the registration of the 2010 Transfer, the 2010 Transfer would not have been registered, and the Deceased would have remained as owner of the Property, with the benefit of an unpaid vendor’s lien.  As such, so it is alleged, the negligence of Rees Page caused the Deceased to lose the value of the Property, subject to credit being given for money credited to the Deceased by the Bank and (subject to a claim for this money which is said to have been made by the Bank) money received as a result of the claim made by the Deceased against FLP.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Rees Page were never instructed to act on behalf of the Deceased.  Rees Page were instructed to act for the Bank.  Rees Page were initially asked to include the 2008 Transaction in their investigations of various mortgage loans made by the Bank.  Subsequently Rees Page were instructed by the Bank to procure the registration of the Attarian Charge.  This in turn required the execution and registration of a valid form of transfer as between the Deceased and Mr. Attarian, which Rees Page were also instructed to procure.  In the exercise of procuring a valid form of transfer Rees Page were acting for the Bank.  The position of the Deceased, in relation to Rees Page, was that of a third party.  In a conveyancing transaction a solicitor acting for one party will not normally owe a duty to a third party; see the decision of Donald Nicholls V-C, as he then was, in <span style="font-style:italic">Gran Gelato v Richcliff (Group) Ltd</span> [1992] Ch 560, at 570D: </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">My attention was drawn to two more recent cases in which <span style="font-style:italic">Gran Gelato</span> has been treated as good law.  The first of these is <span style="font-style:italic">NRAM Ltd v Steel</span> [2018] 1 W.L.R. 1190, in which the Supreme Court decided, in a Scottish case, that a solicitor acting for a borrower would not be held to have assumed responsibility in making a misrepresentation to the lender for which it was not instructed.  Judgment in the Supreme Court was given by Lord Wilson, with whose judgment the other members of the Supreme Court agreed.  At [24] and [25], Lord Wilson noted that the concept of an assumption of responsibility remained the foundation of liability in tort for a negligent misrepresentation.  As Lord Wilson explained:</p>

Lord Goff of Chieveley explained at p 316 that the basis of his conclusion was that the defendants had assumed responsibility to the claimant in respect of the reference within the meaning of the Hedley Byrne case [1964] AC 465. Weeks later, in Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd [1995] 2 AC 145, the House held that underwriting agents at Lloyd’s owed a duty of care to a member in their conduct of his underwriting affairs even in the absence of any contract between them. In a speech with which the other members of the House agreed, Lord Goff held at p 181 that the case should be decided by reference to the concept of an assumption of responsibility. In Williams v Natural Life Health Foods Ltd [1998] 1 WLR 830. Lord Steyn remarked at p 837 that there was no better rationalisation for liability in tort for negligent misrepresentation than the concept of an assumption of responsibility. It has therefore become clear that, although it may require cautious incremental development in order to fit cases to which it does not readily apply, this concept remains the foundation of the liability.</span></p>

The concept fits the present case perfectly and there is no need to consider whether there should be any incremental development of it. Nevertheless the case has an unusual dimension: for the claim is brought by one party to an arm’s length transaction against the solicitor who was acting for the other party. A solicitor owes a duty of care to the party for whom he is acting but generally owes no duty to the opposite party: Ross v Caunters [1980] Ch 297, 322. The absence of that duty runs parallel with the absence of any general duty of care on the part of one litigant towards his opponent: Jain v Trent Strategic Health Authority [2009] AC 853. Six authorities, briefly noticed in chronological order in what follows, may illumine inquiry into the existence of an assumption of responsibility by a solicitor towards the opposite party.”</span></p>

The claimant wished to purchase an underlease from the first defendant. The claimant’s solicitors inquired of the second defendants, a firm of solicitors acting for the first defendant, whether any provisions in the headlease might affect the length of the underlease. The negative answer of the second defendants was a misrepresentation, which, following its purchase of the underlease, caused loss to the claimant. The Vice-Chancellor held that it had a valid claim against the first defendant but that the second defendants had themselves owed no duty of care to it. He observed at pp 571—572 that only in special cases, such as the Allied Finance case [1983] NZLR 22, would a solicitor owe a duty of care to the opposite party and that there was nothing special about the case before him.”</span></p>

First, <span style="font-style:italic">Allied Finance and Investments Ltd v Haddow</span> [1983] NZLR 22 was a case in which solicitors provided a certificate to a lender as to the binding nature of security, whilst they knew that it was not binding. The solicitors were held liable, on the basis that they had provided the certificate in circumstances where they must have known that it was likely to be relied upon by the lender.  Secondly, in <span style="font-style:italic">Al-Kandari v JR Brown</span> [1988] QB 665 liability was established on the basis that solicitors had stepped outside their role as solicitors by agreeing to a court order, which they then breached, to retain passports in their possession.       </p>

The two cases before the Court of Appeal both concerned the purchase of properties from a fraudster, who impersonated the true owner of the relevant property, and made off with the purchase monies when they were paid.  In each case the claimant purchaser brought proceedings against the solicitors who acted for the fraudsters and, in one case, also against the estate agents involved in the sale.  While there were several causes of action relied upon by the claimants in the proceedings, the case is relevant for present purposes by reason of what was said as to liability in negligence.</p>

In the second case, a claim in negligence had not been pleaded at first instance, but was the subject of an application for permission to amend to include the claim in negligence.

There will rarely be an actual, conscious and voluntary assumption of responsibility not least because the solicitor or other professional will have a client to whom he is contractually bound. But, on the basis that the court is deciding whether to treat the defendant as having assumed legal responsibility to the third party, non-client, for his actions, it will be necessary to balance the foreseeability that the third party will rely on the professional to perform their task in a competent manner against any other factors which would make such an imposition of liability unreasonable or unfair.”</span></p>

That is because the statutory duty was imposed for the benefit of society at large and not for any particular class of persons, such as the purchasers in these cases, who are likely to suffer loss if the vendor turns out to be an imposter. In part, this is because the principal purpose of the MLR is to deter money laundering and terrorism rather than to combat identity fraud. The fact that the AML checks may have a deterrent effect on would-be fraudsters is not enough in itself to create a private law right of action for the benefit of a protected class: see X (Minors) v Bedfordshire County Council [1995] 2 AC 633, 731.”</span></p>

Nor is there anything in the nature of the particular transactions (unlike in Dean v Allin &amp; Watts [2001] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 249) which can be treated as having created a relevant assumption of responsibility or to have made it reasonable in itself for the purchaser to have relied on the vendor’s solicitors and agents to have acted competently in that regard. More particularly, there is nothing in the way that these transactions were conducted which made it objectively reasonable to assume that the AML checks would be complete and that the defendants should be legally accountable to the purchasers for the consequences. I find it difficult to see how the imposition of such liability can be justified in this case where it is common ground that Parliament did not intend a breach of the MLR to create a private law cause of action in favour of the claimants. In Dreamvar there was also, as I mentioned earlier, positive evidence that the purchaser’s solicitors did not even consider that MMS were warranting that they acted for the true owner.</span></p>

Rees Page were not instructed to act for the Deceased, and did not agree to do anything for the Deceased.  To the contrary, Mr. Kilvert made it clear, as recorded in his note of his telephone conversation with the Deceased on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2011, that he could not advise the Deceased.  I agree with the Deputy Master (J40) that the interests of the Bank and the Deceased were distinct, and analogous to the positions of the seller and buyer in <span style="font-style:italic">Gran Gelato</span>.  I would go further.  It seems to me that the positions of the Bank and the Deceased were, on the case of the Estate, in conflict.  The interest of the Bank was in securing registration of the 2010 Transfer and the Attarian Charge.  The interest of the Deceased, on the Estate’s case, was in preventing this happening.  If the Estate is correct in its case, there was a conflict of interest between the parties.  Rees Page were instructed by the Bank.  I cannot see how, in these circumstances, Rees Page could have owed a duty of care to the Deceased; see Patten LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">P&amp;P</span> at [79].</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There are points which can be made in relation to the evidence of Mr. Kilvert and the evidence of the contemporaneous documents.  In his note of his telephone conversation with the Deceased on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2011 Mr. Kilvert refers to having left messages for the Deceased.  Mr. Kilvert also says however, in paragraph 29 of his witness statement, that he had no telephone number for the Deceased.  In the same note Mr. Kilvert refers to having written letters to the Deceased, when it appears that there was only one previous letter to the Deceased (the letter of 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2010) which had been sent.  Mr. Kilvert sought from Mr. Kan confirmation of the identity of the Deceased as the Signatory, but proceeded with the application to register the 2010 Transfer and the Attarian Charge in circumstances where he knew that this evidence had not been provided.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is also possible to be critical of the way in which Mr. Kilvert completed the application for registration.  I take the points made by Mr. Brown that the Land Registry was not informed that the 2010 TR1 had been backdated, and that the requirement to provide evidence of identity was avoided by specifying FLP as the conveyancers acting for the Deceased, when FLP had acted in relation to the 2008 Transaction, and had not been involved in the 2010 Transfer.  In oral submissions Mr. Cousins argued that the application form should not be seen as speaking at the time the application form was lodged, but was rather providing information in relation to the relevant transaction; namely the 2008 Transaction.  For what it is worth I doubt that this argument is correct.  It seems to me that the application form was concerned with, or at least included the transaction constituted by the execution of the 2010 Transfer, in respect of which the Deceased appears to have been unrepresented.     </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is also important to note that there is no allegation of dishonesty or professional misconduct made against Mr. Kilvert in this case.  Given this position, if Mr. Kilvert is wrong, either in his witness statement or in the documents which he wrote (meaning both letters and attendance notes) at the relevant times, this would have to be because Mr. Kilvert got the factual position wrong, both in what he wrote at the relevant times and in his witness statement.  It is however fanciful to suggest that Mr. Kilvert made the sort of wholesale factual errors which would be required to in order to explain how his evidence and his documents completely contradict the Estate’s case.   </p>

This seems to me yet another reason why the Estate was required, at the Hearing, to produce evidence to back up its allegation of knowledge or assumed knowledge of the forgery on the part of Mr. Kilvert.  The Estate signally failed to do this.</p>

There appears to be no evidence, either from a witness or in the documents, to support this case.  No reason has been identified for thinking that some further document or documents might emerge on disclosure which would provide support for this case.  The evidence of Mr. Kilvert and the contemporaneous documents contradict this case.  In my judgment the Estate’s case in paragraphs 24, 25 and 32 of the Amended Particulars of Claim has no real, or indeed any prospect of success.  I think that it is possible to make the finding, on a summary basis, that Mr. Kilvert neither knew, nor had grounds to know, in his dealings with this case on behalf of the Bank, that the signature on the 2010 TR1 was or might be forged.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In oral submissions Mr. Brown sought to widen the argument that the present case was an unusual one, which presented a number of red flags to Mr. Kilvert, which Mr. Kilvert should have picked up.  Mr. Brown also referred to the case as being one where alarm bells were ringing loudly, to the effect that the Deceased might not be a willing participant in the execution of a valid form of transfer.  While accepting that Mr. Kilvert had been instructed by the Bank to procure a validly executed transfer from the Deceased, so that the Attarian Charge could be registered, Mr. Brown went so far as to submit that Mr. Kilvert should have declined to follow the Bank’s instruction to procure the required transfer from the Deceased.  It seems to me however that once the Estate’s case in paragraphs 24, 25, and 32 falls away, as in my judgment it does, there is nothing left to support the case that Mr. Kilvert was obliged to act contrary to his instructions, and decline to see through the process of procuring a validly executed form of transfer from the Deceased.  Things might have been different if, at the relevant time, the Deceased had ever communicated to Mr. Kilvert that he had not signed the 2010 TR1, or was not prepared to do so.  There is however no evidence to establish that either of these things was ever done nor, in my judgment, any prospect of any evidence turning up at a later stage in this action to establish that either of these things was ever done.   Beyond this, it is important to keep in mind that any such communication from the Deceased would have been a matter for Mr. Kilvert to report to his own client, the Bank, because such information would have had a bearing on Mr. Kilvert’s performance of his duty to the Bank as his client.  This in turn seems to me to bring out, again, the central point that the interests of the Deceased, on the Estate’s case, were not aligned with the interests of the Bank, which in turn fatally undermines the argument that Rees Page could have owed a duty of care to the Deceased. </p>

So far however as it is relevant to consider the RPOC, I do not think that they alter the position as it stands on the Amended Particulars of Claim.  In the RPOC the claim against Rees Page is fleshed out to a considerable degree.  In particular, in paragraphs 30-43 an attempt is made to establish that there was a direct assumption by Rees Page of responsibility to the Deceased, sufficient to found a duty of care.  The attempt includes a repetition of the factual case in paragraphs 24, 25 and 32 of the Amended Particulars of Claim which, as I have already explained, is a case which can be seen to have no real prospect of success in advance of trial.   In my judgment the attempt to establish a duty of care in the RPOC also fails, essentially for the same reasons as the attempt fails in the Amended Particulars of Claim.</p>

In order to decide whether a duty of care was owed in the present case, it was necessary to take all the facts and circumstances of this case into account.

This is essentially what the Deputy Master decided, at J38-46.

I understood this ground of appeal to be referring the Estate’s factual case in paragraphs 24, 25 and 32 of the Amended Particulars of Claim.  The essential argument of Mr. Brown was that the Deputy Master, in his recitation of the facts of the case, ignored the Estate’s pleaded factual case, when he was obliged to proceed on the basis that the Estate’s pleaded factual case should be treated, for summary judgment purposes, as true.</p>

The position is however not necessarily the same on a summary judgment application.  As Floyd LJ explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Optaglio</span>, the court is not obliged to accept without analysis everything said by a party in his statements before the court. In some cases it may be clear that there is no real substance in factual assertions made, particularly if contradicted by contemporary documents. If so, issues which are dependent upon those factual assertions may be susceptible of disposal at an early stage so as to save the cost and delay of trying an issue the outcome of which is inevitable.  In such a case the court must however explain, with reasonable particularity, what is about the contemporary record or other evidence which justifies rejecting the account of a particular witness.</p>

That pleaded case is not supported by a witness statement from any witness.  The Deceased, sadly, is no longer able to give evidence in support of the pleaded case.  Nor is there anything in the documents to support the pleaded case.  It seems to me therefore that the factual conflict in the present case is one between a pleaded case, confirmed by a statement of truth, on the one side, and the evidence of the relevant witness and the relevant documents, on the other side.

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">If however one does apply the approach in <span style="font-style:italic">Optaglio</span> it seems to me that there are good reasons, to support the rejection, at summary judgment stage, of the Estate’s case in paragraphs 24, 25 and 32 of the Amended Particulars of Claim.  I have explained those reasons earlier in this section of this judgment.  This is essentially what the Deputy Master decided, at J42, where he accepted the <span style="font-style:italic">“substantial accuracy”</span> of the evidence of Mr. Kilvert and the relevant file notes.  It may be said, with due respect to the Deputy Master, that the reasoning in J42 was only briefly expressed, but it seems to me that the Deputy Master was right to accept this evidence, and right to take the view that nothing had been put before him which offered any real prospect of success at trial for the factual case which the Estate was seeking to establish.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At the risk of repeating myself, I come back to the points that (i) there is no challenge to the honesty of Mr. Kilvert, (ii) the contemporaneous documents contradict the relevant part of the Estate’s case, and (iii) the Estate is unable to point to the evidence of any witness or any document which contradicts the evidence of Mr. Kilvert and the contemporaneous documents.  I therefore conclude that the second ground of appeal fails.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is of course the case that this ground of appeal assumes that the outcome of the Appeal and the Applications is that the Bank and the CLR will, at the least, be left in the action.  That assumption depends upon my decision on the Applications, which is for later sections of this judgment.  It seems to me however that the <span style="font-style:italic">Iliffe</span> point fails, whether or not any other party remains in the action.  If the position is that it can be decided now that Rees Page owed no duty of care to the Deceased, I can see no reason whatsoever why Rees Page should remain in the action by reason of the fact, if it is a fact, that the action will go to trial so far as the other Defendants or some of them are concerned.  I have already set out the essential facts of the <span style="font-style:italic">Iliffe</span> case.  They were very different to the present case.  There is also the point that, in <span style="font-style:italic">Iliffe</span>, the causation of the fire was not, in any event, sufficiently clear to justify the grant of summary judgment.  That is not the position in the present case, so far as the duty of care issue in the claim against Rees Page is concerned.  If one assumes a trial involving the Estate’s claims against the CLR and the Bank, I cannot see why Rees Page must continue to be a party in order to ensure a fair trial of those claims.  The same seems to me to be the case if one assumes that LDS remain a Defendant to the action.</p>

In any event if one assumes, contrary to what seems to me to be the case, that Rees Page do have under their control a document or documents which is important to the claims against the other Defendants or some of them, there is the option of seeking third party disclosure against Rees Page.</p>

It seems to me that the Estate had and has no real, or indeed any prospect of succeeding, at trial, in its case that Rees Page owed a duty of care to the Estate.

As such, so it is contended on behalf of Rees Page, the Deceased cannot have been caused any loss by Rees Page because the 2008 Transaction left him with no vendor’s lien (the purchase monies having been credited to him by FLP), and no more than a bare legal interest in the Property.     </p>

In support of this contention Mr. Cousins relied upon the letters which Mr. Kilvert sent to the Deceased, dated respectively 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2010 and 11<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2011, and upon the note which Mr. Kilvert made of his telephone conversation with the Deceased which took place on 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2011.  The Deceased did not challenge anything said in the letters or the telephone conversation.  As such, so it was argued, there was nothing to put Mr. Kilvert on notice that he needed to do anything more than he did.   </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As I read the Judgment, this argument was not a matter which the Deputy Master dealt with in the Judgment.  I do not think that the argument provides a good reason for upholding the dismissal of the claim against Rees Page, if one assumes that a duty of care was owed.  It is true, for the reasons which I have already explained, that the Estate has no real prospect of challenging, at a trial, Mr. Kilvert’s account of his dealings with the Deceased.  To this extent therefore, the factual basis for the argument is in place.  Mr. Kilvert had only the dealings with the Deceased which he describes, his letters of 14<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2010 were not answered or challenged by the Deceased, and his only conversation with the Deceased was the telephone conversation of 9<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> March 2011, which can be assumed to have taken place in the terms described by Mr. Kilvert.</p>

This seems to me to be so even if one approaches the question of breach on the basis, which seems to me to be correct, that Mr. Kilvert’s knowledge of the situation at the relevant time did not include knowledge that the signature on the 2010 TR1 was or might be a forgery.  Once one assumes the existence of a duty of care owed to the Deceased, it seems to me that the question of what Mr. Kilvert should and should not have done, in discharge of that duty of care, raises questions which are not suitable for summary determination.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The same considerations seem to me to apply to the argument that the Deceased was the author of his own loss. At this stage of the argument one assumes that Rees Page did owe a duty of care to the Deceased, and breached that duty of care.  The argument that the chain of causation was broken by the Deceased’s silence and inactivity seems to me, again, to raise fact sensitive questions which are not suitable for summary determination.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This leaves the additional argument of Rees Page in relation to causation.  The additional argument relies principally upon the RPOC.  Paragraph 12 of the RPOC pleads that contracts were exchanged between the Deceased and Mr. Attarian in the 2008 Transaction, for the price of £1.25 million.  Paragraph 15 of the RPOC pleads a number of steps which are said to have been taken towards purported completion of the 2008 Transaction.  Those steps include the allegations that (i) the intended purchase monies were advanced by the Bank to FLP, in FLP’s capacity as solicitors for the Bank and Mr. Attarian, (ii) on the same day FLP allocated the purchase monies to the credit of the Deceased, and (iii) on the same day FLP, as solicitors for the Deceased, arranged to allocate the purchase monies to FLP, in their capacity as solicitors for the Bank, for the purposes of discharging the Original Charge.                 </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The point made by Mr. Cousins, on behalf of Rees Page, is that if Rees Page were in breach of a duty of care which they owed to the Deceased, they cannot have caused the Deceased any loss because the Deceased in fact received, by FLP, the purchase monies on the 2008 Transaction.  As such, the Deceased cannot have had any unpaid vendor’s lien as a consequence of the 2008 Transaction and, for the same reason, cannot have had the right to any further payment in respect of the 2008 Transaction.  On this hypothesis the 2008 Transaction left the Deceased with no more than a bare legal title to the Property, which the Deceased was bound to transfer to Mr. Attarian.  Mr. Cousins also pointed out that if one puts the purchase monies credited to the Deceased together with the sums which the Estate accepts were received by the Deceased, by way of part of the purchase monies and subsequent compensation payments, the Deceased in fact had the benefit of the receipt of monies substantially in excess of what he would have received if the 2008 Transaction had completed as a normal transaction.  All this was reiterated to me, in a supplemental submission sent to me by Mr. Cousins in a letter dated 20<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> December 2021.</p>

The pleaded case is that if this negligence had not occurred, the 2010 TR1 would not have been created, and the Deceased would have remained as owner of the Property, with the benefit of an unpaid vendor’s lien.  As such, so it is alleged, the negligence of LDS caused the Deceased to lose the value of the Property, subject to credit being given for money credited to the Deceased by the Bank and (subject to a claim for this money which is said to have been made by the Bank) the money received as a result of the claim made by the Deceased against FLP.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In this context it is important to have in mind what was said by Pill LJ, as to the purpose of requiring a deed to be witnessed, in <span style="font-style:italic">Shah v Shah</span> [2001] EWCA Civ 527 [2002] QB 35.  In that case the question before the Court of Appeal was whether estoppel could be relied upon, in a case where a deed had not been witnessed, to overcome the statutory requirement for the deed to have been witnessed, as set out in Section 1 of the Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989.  For present purposes however the relevance of the case is confined to Pill LJ’s explanation of the purpose of attestation, at [29]:</p>

I also accept that attestation has a purpose in that it limits the scope for disputes as to whether the document was signed and the circumstances in which it was signed. The beneficial effect of the requirement for attestation of the signature in the manner specified in the statute is not in question. It gives some, but not complete, protection to other parties to the deed who can have more confidence in the genuineness of the signature by reason of the attestation. It gives some, but not complete,  protection to a potential signatory who may be under a disability, either permanent or temporary. A person may aver in opposition to his own deed that he was induced to execute it by fraud, misrepresentation or, as was unsuccessfully alleged in the present case, duress and the attestation requirement is a safeguard.”</span></p>

Such a person, even if a professional person such as a solicitor and even if charging a fee for the act of witnessing the relevant signature, does not agree to do more, in the absence of any evidence of agreement to do more.  Such a person does not agree to have any further involvement in the transaction, or to act for any person in the transaction, or to protect any person from loss which may result from the transaction, either because the transaction is ill-advised or because fraud is involved.</p>

Mr. Brown was not able to point to any authority which provided specific support for this case.

Nor is it sufficient that the test of proximity is satisfied whether by an actual assumption of responsibility or by the existence of a direct interest on the part of the third party (as in Dean v Allin &amp; Watts) in the product of the solicitors’ instructions. The incremental approach approved in Caparo requires all these and any other relevant factors to be taken into account and globally assessed including any relevant policy considerations. In deciding whether it is just or reasonable to recognise a duty of care, the approach enshrined in the case law requires the court to take account of the contractual framework and any other factors bearing on liability.”</span></p>

All that LDS agreed to do, for a modest fee, was to witness the signature of the Signatory on the 2010 TR1.  Given this limited role I find it impossible to see how such a duty of care could have arisen.  It is important to keep in mind that a solicitor acting in a property transaction owes no duty in tort to protect a potential victim of fraud from foreseeable economic loss by verifying the identity of his own client, even where there is a statutory obligation to carry out a verification process; see Patten LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">P&amp;P/Dreamvar</span>, at [81].  If this is the case, it is difficult to see how a solicitors whose role in the relevant transaction is confined to witnessing a deed in the transaction can be held to have owed a duty to protect any party from the consequences of the person signing the relevant deed turning out to be a fraudster. </p>

Even if however the MLR did apply to the act of witnessing the signature, I cannot see that this would give rise to any duty of care of the kind alleged by the Estate.

By way of example, there might be reason for thinking that LDS agreed to do something more than merely witness the signature of the Signatory to the 2010 TR1, which had a bearing on the question of whether the alleged duty of care was owed.  There might be reason for thinking that Mr. Kan had some special knowledge of the case, which had a bearing on the question of whether the alleged duty of care was owed.  I cannot however see any such reason for thinking that this will or might be the case.  The relevant facts concerning the Signing Event are already established.  The Deceased is not available to give any evidence to contradict the evidence of Mr. Kan and Mr. Kilvert.  The Estate has served no evidence in response to the evidence of Mr. Kan.  The Estate is unable to point to any document or documents relevant to the Signing Event which might change the factual landscape of the claim against LDS.  The assumption falls to be made, at this stage, that Mr. Kan did not take any steps to verify the identity of the Signatory, but that assumption does not seem to me to be relevant to the threshold question of whether a duty of care was owed.</p>

In paragraph 48.2 of the RPOC it is pleaded that Mr. Kan failed to witness the signature of the Signatory at all.  The basis for this allegation is that the Report states that the signature of the Signatory was retouched using a different pen and that there are repeated practice indentations on the 2010 TR1.  It is said that Mr. Kan has not advanced any coherent explanation regarding the circumstances of the signature.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There are a number of problems with this attempt to revise the Estate’s case.  The first is that this allegation is not actually pleaded against Mr. Kan.  It exists only in a draft pleading, which the Estate has avoided making the subject of an application to re-amend.  In addition to this, the Estate has chosen not to identify to me the re-amendments for which it is said that the Estate will seek permission to re-amend at a later stage in the action, possibly at the delayed case management conference, or possibly following disclosure in the action, or possibly at some other time.  The timing of such an application has been left up in the air, along with what the Estate might actually be saying in any such re-amended case.  In my judgment this was not and is not an acceptable way for the Estate to defend the summary judgment application made by LDS.  If the Estate is alleging that Mr. Kan did not witness the 2010 TR1 at all, the Estate should be prepared to make this allegation as part of its pleaded case.  I am not prepared to entertain, as a ground of defence to the summary judgment application, an allegation against Mr. Kan, namely that he did not witness the 2010 TR1 at all, which the Estate has not pleaded and remains unwilling to plead.  In my judgment this is an abuse of the process of the court, which the court should not permit. </p>

Mr. Kan’s evidence is perfectly clear that the relevant signature on the 2010 TR1 is his signature.  This evidence is supported by the contemporaneous documents, which are consistent with Mr. Kan signing the 2010 TR1 as witness of the signature of the Signatory.  If Mr. Kan did not in fact witness the signature of the Signatory on the 2010 TR1 the obvious questions which arise are how Mr. Kan came, at the relevant time, to believe that he had witnessed the signature of the Signatory, and how the 2010  TR1 comes to contain a signature which purports to be the signature of Mr. Kan, overlaid with the formal stamp of LDS.        </p>

She says that the ESDA findings are consistent with practice simulations made on a piece of paper while resting on the 2010 TR1.  Ms. Radley also makes the point, on the basis of the ESDA results, that the questioned signature was written while the second page of the 2010 TR1 was resting on page 1 of the same document.  This was not however the case with other ballpoint entries on page 2.  Ms Radley also points out that the entries on page 2 in relation to LDS were appended using a non-ballpoint pen ink, which often does not leave good ESDA impressions <span style="font-style:italic">“and therefore I cannot determine whether or not these entries were made whilst resting on page 1.”</span>; see paragraph 10(vii) on page 3 of the Report.        </p>

It seems to me that there is no real factual conflict in this respect, let alone any factual conflict which needs to go to trial.  Although the situation is not all fours with <span style="font-style:italic">Optaglio</span>, because I am not deciding to reject the evidence of any witness, it does seem to me that the present case is one where the attempt to rely on the Report to make good the case that Mr. Kan did not witness the signature of the Signatory on the 2010 TR1 is one which can, at this stage, be seen to have no real prospect of success.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Beyond this however, there is also this puzzling feature of paragraphs 48 and 49 of the RPOC.  If Mr. Kan did not in fact witness the signature of the Signatory on the 2010 TR1 at all, what is the case against LDS?  If it is said that Mr. Kan colluded with the Signatory, so as to allow the Signatory to forge the Deceased’s signature on the 2010 TR1, and then proceeded to pretend to witness the signature by signing the 2010 TR1 on a separate occasion, this needs to be pleaded, not least because it would engage an allegation of serious professional misconduct against Mr. Kan.  No such case is however pleaded.  If this is not said, one comes back to the question of how Mr. Kan’s signature ended upon on the 2010 TR1.  An answer to this might be that what purported to be Mr. Kan’s signature on the 2010 TR1 was in fact a forgery, and that Mr. Kan somehow managed to persuade himself, contrary to the fact, that he had witnessed the signature of the Signatory on the 2010 TR1 when he had not done so.  This however is an absurd hypothesis, and one which would, in any event, appear to destroy the claim against LDS because, on this basis, it would appear that LDS were never engaged in witnessing the signature of the Signatory on the 2010 TR1.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The second ground of appeal is that the Deputy Master was wrong to determine facts which were in dispute on a summary basis.  Again, this second ground of appeal does not appear to be directed against LDS.  If and in so far however as the second ground of appeal is directed against LDS, it also seems to me to fail.  The reason for this is that in determining whether LDS owed a duty of care of the kind alleged by the Estate, it is not in fact necessary to resolve any conflicts of fact.  For the reasons which I have set out, there is nothing to contradict the evidence of Mr. Kan, in paragraph 8 of his witness statement, that he believes that he did witness the signature of the Signatory on the 2010 TR1, and did so in the belief that the Signatory was the Deceased, even if (contrary to his belief) he failed to verify the identity of the Signatory.  As I have also explained, it is necessary to assume, for summary judgment purposes, that the Signatory was not the Deceased.  This assumption does not however interfere with the ability of the court to decide, at summary judgment stage, that there is no real prospect of success for the argument that LDS owed a duty of the care to the Deceased of the kind alleged by the Estate, either as currently pleaded or as pleaded in the RPOC.  Indeed, it may be said that there is this point of difference between Rees Page and LDS in the Appeal.  In the case of the claim against Rees Page, consideration of the claim of a duty of care requires going into the facts of the case to a certain degree.  In the case of the claim against LDS, consideration of the claim of a duty of care can be dealt with on a strike out basis, by which I mean that the claim can be dealt with on the basis that what is pleaded in the Amended Particulars of Claim is insufficient to establish the pleaded duty of care.</p>

If the position is that it can be decided now that LDS owed no duty of care to the Deceased, I can see no reason whatsoever why LDS should remain in the action by reason of the fact, if it is a fact, that the action will go to trial so far as the other Defendants or some of them are concerned.  As I have already explained, the facts of the <span style="font-style:italic">Iliffe</span> case were very different to the present case, and involved an issue of causation which was not, in any event, sufficiently clear to justify the grant of summary judgment.

It seems to me that the Estate had and has no real, or indeed any prospect of succeeding, at trial, in its case that LDS owed a duty of care to the Estate of the kind alleged.  I also agree with the Deputy Master that there is no other compelling reason why the claim against LDS should go to trial.  I would only add that, in the case of the claim against LDS, I consider that it was open to the Deputy Master to have decided the duty of care question pursuant to his jurisdiction to strike out, in addition to his jurisdiction to grant summary judgment to LDS on this point. </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">LDS argues that if it did owe the alleged duty of care, and breached that duty of care, there was a breach in the chain of causation, either by reason of the unreasonable conduct of the Deceased or, if the Estate’s pleaded case is accepted in this respect, by reason of the unreasonable conduct of Rees Page in registering the 2010 Transfer when Mr. Kilvert had been informed by the Deceased that the Deceased had not signed the 2010 Transfer.</p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">LDS also adopts the same additional causation argument pursued by Rees Page; namely the Causation Argument.  It will be recalled that the Causation Argument relies on the RPOC, and the assertions therein that contracts were exchanged in the 2008 Transaction and the purchase monies paid to the Deceased, in discharge of the Original Charge.  As such, so it is contended on behalf of LDS, the Deceased cannot have been caused any loss by LDS because the 2008 Transaction left him with no vendor’s lien (the purchase monies having been credited to him by FLP), and no more than a bare legal interest in the Property.     </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">So far as the arguments of break in the chain of causation are concerned, I do not think that those arguments would be suitable for summary determination.  At this stage of the argument one assumes that LDS did owe the pleaded duty of care to the Deceased, and breached that duty of care.  The argument that the chain of causation was broken by the Deceased’s silence and inactivity seems to me, again, to raise fact sensitive questions which are not suitable for summary determination.  The same would, in my judgment, also hold good in relation to the role of Rees Page in the registration of the 2010 Transfer, if one assumes that Rees Page were still in the action, and had been found to have breached the duty of care which they are said to have owed to the Deceased.</p>

In the case of the claim against Rees Page I have explained why my consideration of the Causation Argument falls to be deferred to my consideration of the Applications.  The same applies to my consideration of the Causation Argument, in relation to the claim against LDS.</p>

I repeat, for the avoidance of any doubt, that my references to LDS include Mr. Kan, and thus include the claim against Mr. Kan.  The basis of this result is my decision that the Deputy Master was correct to decide (i) that the Estate had no real prospect of establishing that LDS owed a duty of care to the Deceased of the kind alleged by the Estate and (ii) that there was no other compelling reason for the claim against LDS to go to trial.  Whether this result can also be based on the Causation Argument, as adopted by LDS, will be considered when I come to the Applications.         </p>

By the Order the Deputy Master awarded LDS their costs of their application on the indemnity basis.  The Deputy Master awarded Rees Page their costs of their application on the standard basis, to 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July 2108, and thereafter on the indemnity basis.   The Estate’s case, in this part of the Appeal, is that there was nothing in the Estate’s conduct of the case to take the case out of the norm, and that no costs should have been awarded on the indemnity basis.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Dealing first with Rees Page, the Deputy Master decided to award costs on the indemnity basis essentially for two reasons.  The first was that the Deputy Master took the view that there had been a failure by the Deceased, prior to the commencement of the action, to comply with the Pre-Action Protocol for professional negligence claims.  This was of particular importance in the present case because, in the view of the Deputy Master, the whole point of the Protocol was to prevent costs being run up in relation to claims which had no reasonable prospect of success, into which category, so the Deputy Master had decided, fell the claim against Rees Page.   Second, the solicitors for Rees Page had made a without prejudice save as to costs offer, by letter dated 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2018, which had offered a drop hands settlement to the Estate.  The Deputy Master saw the failure of the Estate to take up this offer as the crucial point taking the case outside the norm, because the offer afforded the Estate a way out of the litigation against Rees Page.  As such the Deputy Master decided that it was appropriate to order costs on the indemnity basis as from 7<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2018 (the reference to 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> July 2018 in the Order appears to be an error).</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Turning to LDS the Deputy Master took the view that the claim against LDS was an extremely novel action, arising out an involvement in the case, on the part of LDS, which had lasted a matter of minutes only, when the 2010 TR1 was witnessed.  The Deputy Master went on, in this context, to criticise the pre-action conduct of the Deceased, which he characterised as <span style="font-style:italic">“quite extraordinary”</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">“improper”</span>, in terms of the extent of its non-compliance with the Protocol.  The Deputy Master continued this criticism into the period after commencement of the action, and concluded this part of his costs judgment with the point that if there had been compliance with the Protocol, there was a reasonable prospect that the claim against LDS would not have been made.  Drawing all of this together, the Deputy Master concluded that LDS should have their costs on the indemnity basis from the outset.</p>

As the editors explain, an award of costs on the indemnity basis is appropriate in circumstances where the conduct of a party or other particular circumstances of the case (or both) are such as to take the situation out of the norm in a way which justifies an order for indemnity costs.  The discretion to award costs on the indemnity basis is a wide one, given that there is an infinite variety of situations which might justify the court in making such an order.  Mr. Brown’s essential point was that there was nothing out of the norm in the conduct of the action.  The claims made in the action did not lack probity, and the fact that the claims had been found to have no real prospect of success did not, in and of itself, justify an award of costs on the indemnity basis.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The difficulty with this part of the Appeal seems to me to be that the Deputy Master did not award costs on the indemnity basis against either of LDS or Rees Page on the basis that the claims against these parties had failed at the summary judgment stage.  Rather the Deputy Master was critical and, in the case of LDS, acutely critical of the pre-action conduct of the Deceased.  In both cases the Deputy Master was of the view that the claims might never have been commenced if they had been the subject of proper consideration at the pre-action stage.  In the case of LDS the Deputy Master was of the view that this conduct continued into the period after commencement of the action.  In the case of Rees Page there was the offer of a drop hands settlement, which would have avoided the Estate incurring the costs of defeat on the summary judgment application.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In his decisions to award costs on the indemnity basis, to the extent that he did so, the Deputy Master was exercising his discretion, which was a wide one.  It follows that it would only be open to me to interfere with the relevant parts of the Order if I was persuaded that the Deputy Master had stepped outside the wide ambit of his discretion, and made a decision which no reasonable judge could have made, or had gone wrong in law or principle in some manner.    I do not think that the Deputy Master did any of these things.  It seems to me that the matters relied upon by the Deputy Master in deciding to award costs on the indemnity basis were matters upon which the Deputy Master was entitled to rely for the purposes of his decision.  In other words, it seems to me that the Deputy Master made a decision, in this respect, which he was entitled to make.  Indeed, I would go further.  Given the failures in the pre-action conduct of the Deceased and given the offer of settlement made by Rees Page, it seems to me that the Deputy Master was right to see the relevant circumstances of the case as justifying the awards of costs on the indemnity basis which he made.</p>

This in turn begs the question, also raised by the Causation Argument, of whether the Deceased did in fact have an unpaid vendor’s lien at the time when the 2008 Transaction was supposed to have completed.  This question also overlaps with the question of whether the Original Charge was or was not redeemed at the time when the 2008 Transaction was supposed to have completed. </p>

Both Rees Page and LDS advanced the Causation Argument, as part of their resistance to the Appeal.  The CLR advanced a similar argument, in support of the Application of the CLR.  The Bank did not support these arguments.  The Bank’s position was that the Original Charge had not been redeemed.  The result of this was that Mr. Brown, in resisting the Causation Argument and the associated argument of the CLR, found that he had a certain measure of support from Mr. Allcock, on behalf of the Bank.   </p>

On this basis, the Deceased had no unpaid vendor’s lien, and could not have resisted a claim by Mr. Attarian for the Deceased to be required to execute a transfer of the Property to Mr. Attarian.  As such there was no mistake made, either in the registration of the 2010 Transfer or in the registration of the Attarian Charge, which prejudicially affected the Deceased.  Even if the 2010 Transfer was the result of a forgery, all that the Deceased lost as a result of the registration of the 2010 Transfer was a bare legal title to the Property, which the Deceased was obliged to transfer to Mr. Attarian in any event.</p>

This is what the RPOC say, but the RPOC  are not the pleaded case of the Estate.  The pleaded case of the Estate remains as set out in the Amended Particulars of Claim.  As I have already noted, the Estate has rowed back from the RPOC.  The Estate says that it intends to re-amend the Particulars of Claim, but the Estate is not prepared to specify, now, these re-amendments.  Instead, and so far as the 2008 Transaction is concerned, the Estate’s case is now that it does not know what happened to the purchase monies after they came into the hands of FLP.</p>

As I have already explained in a previous section of this judgment, it seems to me that I must approach the Appeal and the Applications on the basis that the Estate’s case is as pleaded in the Amended Particulars of Claim.  I can, so far as I think this appropriate, take into account the RPOC, as a document settled by the Estate’s counsel, and as a document which was, at least originally, intended to be the re-amended statement of case of the Estate, and as a document which may form the basis of the Estate’s re-amended statement of case (subject to the outcome of the Appeal and the Applications).  What I cannot do is to treat the RPOC as the actual re-amended case of the Estate.            </p>

I accept the point, but I do not know what the material was which was before counsel when settling the RPOC, and I do not know what judgment counsel made of that material.  It must be kept in mind that the Application of the CLR is an application for summary judgment or a striking out order.  I do not think that it is right, either by virtue of counsel’s professional obligations when settling the RPOC or for any other reason, to treat the Estate as formally bound by what appears in the RPOC, for the purposes of my decision on the Application of the CLR.  The relevant content of the RPOC is undoubtedly a factor to be taken into account in considering the Application (and the Appeal), but I do not think that this relevant content can, on its own, be treated as decisive of the question of whether the Deceased was paid the purchase price in the 2008 Transaction.</p>

Rather, if the Causation Argument is to succeed it seems to me that this can only be the result of the relevant claims against Rees Page, LDS, and the CLR in the Amended Particulars of Claim being shown either to be bad on their face, by reason of the Causation Argument, or to have no real prospect of success, by reason of the Causation Argument.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I should mention that I have considerable sympathy for all four of the Defendants engaged in the Appeal and the Applications, so far as the RPOC are concerned.  It seems to me unsatisfactory for the Estate to have produced the RPOC, with the expression of a clear intention to re-amend its case in the terms of the RPOC, and then to retreat to a position where the question of re-amendment is left up in the air.  As I have said, it is hard to avoid the impression that the Estate decided to abandon the RPOC once it appreciated that its content was actually destructive of its case.  I do not think however that the sorry procedural history of the RPOC is sufficient to justify a striking out order on the basis of abuse of process.  My attention was drawn to case law in which the repeated changing of a claimant’s case was held to justify striking out the claimant’s proceedings; see the decision of Chief Master Marsh in <span style="font-style:italic">Nekoti v Univilla Ltd</span> [2016] EWHC 556 (Ch).  In that case the Chief Master was persuaded to strike out the claimant’s re-amended particulars of claim on the basis that the claim was, to use the Chief Master’s expression, <span style="font-style:italic">“endlessly mutable”</span>.  The Chief Master expressed his conclusion on the strike out application in the following terms, at [76]:</p>

Taken with the remaining lack of coherence and changing shape of the claim supported by statements of truth about which there is real cause for concern I am satisfied that in the exercise of my discretion the right course of action is to strike out the re-amended particulars of claim relying on both CPR 3.4(2)(a) and (b).”</span></p>

This ground concentrated on the claim as it is pleaded in the Amended Particulars of Claim.  The essential argument was that, on the evidence currently before the court, it could safely be concluded that the Deceased was paid the purchase monies in the 2008 Transaction.  As such, and even without the RPOC, it could safely be concluded that the indemnity claim was bound to fail.</p>

The Deceased suffered no loss because he had no unpaid vendor’s lien following the crediting to him of the purchase monies in the 2008 Transaction.  Although this argument overlaps with the question of whether the Original Charge was redeemed in the 2008 Transaction, Mr. Trompeter was at pains to stress that what mattered was whether the Deceased had been paid the purchase monies in the 2008 Transaction.  If he had, it mattered not whether the Original Charge was redeemed or not.    </p>

On first reading this statement, I took it to be a statement that the Original Charge had been redeemed.  Mr. Allcock submitted however that this was simply a reference to the fact that the Original Charge was removed from the registered title to the Property.  It is certainly possible to read paragraph 47 in this way, and such ambiguity seems to me to render it impossible, at least in the context of the Application of the CLR, to read paragraph 47 as confirmation that the Deceased was paid the purchase monies.</p>

I have to be satisfied that there is no real prospect of the Estate being able, at trial, to refute the Causation Argument, and the associated argument of the CLR.

I agree with Mr. Cousins that what matters in this context is the allocation of the funds received by FLP, in their capacities as trustee and agent of all parties concerned.  For this purpose, what one would want to see are the accounting records (or ledgers) of FLP.  In this context there is a tantalising reference to client ledgers in paragraph 20e of the Amended Particulars of Claim, where it is stated that <span style="font-style:italic">“On 7 March 2008 mortgage funds of £1,250,000 were paid by the Sixth Defendant into FLP’s client account and credited to the Third Defendant’s client ledger”</span>.  This is however as far as the reference to client ledgers go.  The basis on which this statement is made is not clear, but it looks as though someone on the Estate’s side has, at some point, had access to the internal accounting records of FLP.  I find it difficult to believe that there is not more to emerge, by way of those accounting records, which would throw light on how the purchase monies were allocated by FLP.</p>

It seems to me that one needs to be cautious in dealing with contemporaneous documents such as letters, internal drafts, or statements of account, which may have been prepared by a person who was unaware of the fraud and assumed that the purchase monies either were going to be distributed or had been distributed in accordance with what that person expected to happen, as opposed to what actually happened.</p>

By reference to the Amended Particulars of Claim it is not accepted that there was a valid exchange of contracts in the 2008 Transaction.  Paragraph 10 of the Amended Particulars of Claim refers to a purported exchange of contracts.  A valid exchange of contracts is stated in paragraph 12 of the RPOC, but the RPOC do not constitute the pleaded case of the Estate.  It is  not clear, on the available evidence, whether there was a valid exchange of contracts.  One might infer, on the balance of probabilities, that there was such an exchange of contracts, but the drawing of such an inference would be for trial.  If there was no valid exchange of contracts in the 2008 Transaction, this does seem to me to raise some questions, which it is not appropriate for me to go into in this judgment, as to whether the Deceased could be considered as a person with no more than a bare legal interest in the Property following the allocation of the purchase monies by FLP, regardless of how those purchase monies were allocated.</p>

According to the second witness statement of Mr. Singh, it has been common ground in those proceedings that the Original Charge was not redeemed in the 2008 Transaction, so that the mortgage loan secured by the Original Charge remained due and outstanding.  Mr. Singh’s evidence is that this common position dates back as far as 23<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> March 2008, which is the date of a letter written to the Bank by Middlesex Law Chambers, acting as solicitors for the Deceased, which states as follows:                </p>

So far as the Bank’s possession proceedings are concerned. I know no more of them than what I have read in Mr. Singh’s evidence.  It does strike me that what has been said by the Deceased and the Estate about the 2008 Transaction in the proceedings concerning 35 Inglis Road is at least of some relevance in considering the question of how the purchase monies were allocated by FLP.  At the very least, it strikes me as unsafe to conclude that it is clear that the Deceased was paid the purchase monies in the 2008 Transaction, in circumstances where the Bank is saying, based on its own possession proceedings in relation to the 35 Inglis Road, that there was no redemption of the Original Charge in the 2008 Transaction.  The situation seems to me to call for some further investigation.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The third ground relied upon by the CLR in support of the Application was the doctrine of approbation and reprobation.  The essential argument was that the Estate has so far presented a series of different and inconsistent cases, in the Amended Particulars of Claim, in the RPOC (which also contained internally inconsistent claims), and in the unspecified re-amendments for which, according to Mr. Brown, permission would be sought at the long delayed case and costs management conference in the action.

Sympathetic as I am to the position of the CLR, I do not think that the position in the present case is sufficiently similar to that in <span style="font-style:italic">Nekoti</span> to justify striking out the indemnity claim as an abuse of the process of the court. So far as the doctrine of approbation and reprobation is concerned, the doctrine applies to prevent a party from blowing hot and cold.  The doctrine usually applies where one party pursues a particular case in proceedings, and then seeks to do an about face, in the same proceedings or in other proceedings, for the purposes of pursuing an inconsistent case.  In the present case it does not seem to me that this or anything comparable has occurred.  The Amended Particulars of Claim, which set out the Estate’s case, did not significantly change the original pleaded case.  For better or for worse the Amended Particulars of Claim remain the Estate’s pleaded case, and it is by reference to that pleaded case that I am deciding the Appeal and the Applications.  In these circumstances I do not think that the doctrine of approbation and reprobation prevents the Estate from pursuing its pleaded claim against the CLR for an indemnity.   </p>

The subject matter of the request was clearly identified as the <span style="font-style:italic">“decision”</span> which is required by paragraph 1(3), before an indemnity can be paid.  The obvious step for the Estate to have taken would have been to identify its case on paragraph 1(3), but instead the Estate obfuscated, and the opportunity to clarify this part of the Estate’s case was ignored.</p>

I agree with Mr Trompeter that existence of the decision referred to in paragraph 1(3) is a pre-condition to the payment of an indemnity and, as such, needs to be pleaded.  I also agree that whatever is claimed to be the relevant decision for this purpose is not pleaded in the Amended Particulars of Claim.  This gap in the pleaded case might have been filled, at least in practical terms, by a proper reply to request 6 in the request for further information, but this opportunity was not taken.  The RPOC might also have been of assistance in identifying, albeit indirectly, what might be the Estate’s case in this respect, but the RPOC do not assist.  </p>

That however is only speculation on my part, and my speculation may be wrong.  I am in no position to decide the question of whether there was such a decision in the present case and, if so, what it was.  I have heard no argument on what is meant by the reference to <span style="font-style:italic">“a decision”</span> in paragraph 1(3), and I do not know what issues might arise between the Estate and the CLR in this respect.  This is of course why it is so important that a pleaded claim sets out a claimant’s case on all the elements which are required to establish that claim.  If this requirement is not observed, the court is left to guess at what the issues may be on a particular element of the claim, which in turn hinders effective case management and determination of that claim.</p>

As Mr. Allcock explained, once the claim for rectification had been dismissed, as against the Fourth Defendants, there was no need for the declaration against the Bank.  There was no need to bind the Bank into a decision that the signature on the 2010 TR1 was forged because, with the rectification claim gone, there was no prospect of the transfer of the Property to the Fourth Defendants being reversed, or of the Original Charge being reinstated.  Mr. Allcock drew my attention to <span style="font-style:italic">The Bank of New York Mellon v Essar Steel India Ltd</span> [2018] EWHC 3177 (Ch), in which Marcus Smith J explained, at [21], the matters to be taken into account in a decision by the court as to whether to exercise its discretion to make a declaration.

It seems to me that allowing the claim for this declaration, in isolation, to proceed against the Bank would be an abuse of process, rendering it appropriate to strike out the claim for the declaration pursuant to the court’s powers under CPR 3.4(2)(b) and/or pursuant to the inherent jurisdiction of the court.  </p>

This was because the real battleground between the Estate and the Bank lay elsewhere, in relation to the question of whether the Estate’s claim against the Bank could be saved on the basis that there would be a re-amendment of the Estate’s case against the Bank.  Mr. Brown’s essential case was that, in due course, either at the CMC in the action or following disclosure, there would be such a re-amendment, once the Estate had had the opportunity to establish the factual position in relation to the question of whether or not the Original Charge was redeemed in the 2008 Transaction.  This was of course consistent with Mr. Brown’s stance, on the question of re-amendment, in relation to the other claims challenged in the Appeal and the Application.  Re-amendment would come in due course, and would not necessarily be in the terms of the RPOC.</p>

He accepted that, in principle, an application to strike out could be met with an application to amend the relevant statement of case, which might sufficient to avoid the strike out, depending upon the terms of the amendment.   In this acceptance Mr. Allcock was plainly correct.  As Tugendhat J observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Kim v Park</span> [2011] EWHC 1781 (QB), at [40]:</p>

In para 19 of his Judgment the Master recorded that the Claimant had informed him that he already had witnesses.

All there was, in this respect, was an intention to re-amend, on terms which might or might not reflect the RPOC.

The Bank was saying that the Original Charge had not been redeemed, while the CLR was saying that the Original Charge had been redeemed.  As such, so Mr. Brown submitted, there was no basis for a strike out or summary dismissal of the Estate’s claim against the Bank.  The question of whether there was a redemption needed to go to trial. </p>

This however misses the essential point. The central problem with Mr. Brown’s argument is that there currently no viable pleaded claim against the Bank, nor any application to amend the Amended Particulars of Claim to plead a viable claim against the Bank, nor even any draft re-amendment which might form the basis of an application to re-amend.  In this last respect the RPOC are disclaimed.  As I have said, it is hard to avoid the impression that the Estate’s reluctance to commit itself to the RPOC arises out of the problems this would have created for the Estate in the Appeal and in meeting the Application of the CLR.</p>

I agree with the Bank that this is not an acceptable way for the claim against the Bank to be pursued.  In particular, I accept the submission of Mr. Allcock that it would neither be feasible nor acceptable to try to conduct the case management conference in this action on the basis of a claim against the Bank which remained unpleaded.</p>

In his response to the Application of the CLR Mr. Brown cited authority which establishes that it is permissible for a party to plead claims on alternative and inconsistent factual bases.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Binks v Securicor</span> [2003] 1 WLR 2557 the Court of Appeal accepted that the requirement in CPR Part 22 for a statement of truth in a statement of case did not exclude the possibility of a party pleading inconsistent factual alternatives; see Maurice Kay J at [8].  In the present case therefore it seems to me, at least in principle and all other things being equal, that it would have been open to the Estate to plead its case against the CLR on the factual hypothesis that the Original Charge was not redeemed (if this was a necessary element of the claim for an indemnity), and against the Bank on the alternative factual hypothesis that the Original Charge was redeemed.               </p>

The Amended Particulars are required to plead, but do not plead an essential element of the claim to an indemnity; namely the decision referred to in paragraph 1(3) of Schedule 8 which is a pre-condition to the indemnity claim.

By this I mean that the defect seems to me to be one which, in fairness, the Estate should be given the opportunity to put right, by an appropriate application to re-amend its case against the CLR.  The situation does not seem to me to be one where it can be said that the defect cannot be made good.  Mr. Trompeter’s submission was that the required decision had not been pleaded or otherwise identified by the Estate.  The submission was not that it was clear that there was no such decision upon which the Estate could rely, or that the defect was incapable of being made good.</p>

It might be said that it is not for the court to assist the Estate, if the Estate will not assist itself.  It seems to me however that the situation is not as simple as this.  The argument of the Estate, in the Appeal and the Applications, has been that it cannot be required, and should not be required, at this stage, to re-amend its case, and that re-amendment should wait.  I have firmly rejected that argument.  Given this position, it seems to me that it would be wrong not to follow through the logic of my decision, which is that if the Estate wishes to re-amend to save its claim for an indemnity against the CLR, it should do so now.  As such, I think that <span style="font-style:italic">Kim v Park</span> applies, and that the Estate should be given the opportunity to correct the defect in the pleading of its case against the CLR.</p>

It is not unreasonable, as I have decided, to give the Estate the opportunity to retrieve the position.  In the case of the Bank the Estate starts some way further back.  There is no viable pleaded claim against the Bank in the Amended Particulars of Claim.  Nor is there is any clear identification of what a viable pleaded claim would look like.  There is only the claim set out in the RPOC, which the Estate has declined to identify as its proposed re-amended claim against the Bank.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">First, there is the point which I have already made, in the context of the Application of the CLR.  As I have said, the argument of the Estate, in the Appeal and the Applications, has been that it cannot be required, and should not be required, at this stage, to re-amend its case, and that re-amendment should wait.  I have firmly rejected that argument.  If the Estate wishes to re-amend to put a re-amended case against the Bank, it should do so now.  In that sense the Estate has now run out of road.  Any re-amendment cannot be further deferred.  There is however logic in the argument that, with the Estate in this position, the Estate should be allowed a final opportunity to re-amend in order to put its case against the Bank.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Second, and this seems to me a point of distinction between the present case and cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Forrest Fresh Foods</span>, <span style="font-style:italic">Spencer</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic">Newman</span>, the present case is not one where the case which the Estate wishes to put against the Bank is unknown, or obviously hopeless.  In this context it seems to me that it is legitimate to take the RPOC into account, as a document which, at least, shows the likely nature of the re-amended claim against the Bank.  With due respect to those responsible for the RPOC, I am bound to say that the re-amended case pleaded against the Bank is somewhat deficient in setting out clearly the causes of action against the Bank, and how it is that the Estate comes to have a right to damages against the Bank.  Nevertheless it is apparent from the relevant paragraphs of the RPOC (which I have quoted above) that the Estate is asserting that the Original Charge was redeemed and that, for that reason, the Bank has charged interest, claimed arrears, aggregated the lending secured by the Original Charge and the charge on 35 Inglis Road, and pursued possession proceedings without having had the rights to do so.  The only cause of action which I can see identified, at least in express terms, in paragraph 22 of the RPOC is breach of contract. It strikes me that there might be other causes of action, on the hypothesis that the Original Charge was redeemed.  By way of example there might be a claim or claims in restitution.  The relevant point is this.  The RPOC do disclose a potentially (I put the matter no higher) viable claim against the Bank.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr. Allcock sought, by various arguments, to demonstrate that any claim which could be discerned from the RPOC was doomed to fail in any event.  Mr. Allcock pointed to the fact that the RPOC were internally inconsistent, in the sense that they pleaded a claim against the Bank on the basis that the Original Charge had been redeemed, while pleading claims against the other Defendants which depended upon the factual hypothesis that the Original Charge had not been redeemed.  I accept this point, as the RPOC are currently drafted but, as I have explained, it seems to me that the factual inconsistency in the claims against the CLR and the Bank could be managed by a pleading of the claims on alternative factual bases, in accordance with what was said to be acceptable in <span style="font-style:italic">Binks v Securicor</span>. </p>

He reiterated the arguments of his instructing solicitors, when first presented with the RPOC, that a claim against the Bank on the basis that the Original Charge had been redeemed was not open to the Estate, given the past history of the case and given, in particular, the basis on which the possession proceedings in respect of 35 Inglis Road had been conducted.  Arguments of this kind may or may not be a good answer to a claim based on what is drafted in the RPOC.  It seems to me however that I am not in a position, hearing the Application of the Bank, safely to conclude that the Estate cannot make a claim against the Bank on the basis that the Original Charge was redeemed. </p>

Again however, I am not in a position, hearing the Application of the Bank, to make a decision on whether this argument is correct.  Even if it was, it would not necessarily follow that the Estate’s claim against the Bank was incapable of pursuit.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Third, I think that it is important to keep in mind that the hearing of the Applications brought out a distinct difference between the CLR and the Bank.  The CLR’s position is that the Deceased was paid in the 2008 Transaction.  The question of whether that is right is plainly bound up with, or at least related to the question of whether the Original Charge was redeemed in the 2008 Transaction.  The Bank’s position is that the Original Charge was not redeemed.  The order which I have decided to make on the Application of the CLR gives the Estate the opportunity to save its claim for an indemnity against the CLR, and to pursue that claim to a trial.  If that happens, a key question at the trial, if not the key question will be what happened to the purchase monies once they came into the hands of FLP.  That is a question in which the Bank also has a substantial interest.  It strikes me that it would be unsatisfactory if the question came before a court for trial without the Bank being involved in the trial.  In this context it does seem to me that <span style="font-style:italic">Iliffe</span> has some relevance.  The redemption/non-redemption question is one in which both the CLR and the Bank are substantially interested.  The position is not the same as it is in the Appeal, where the question of whether a duty of care was owned by either firm of solicitors does not overlap with the claims against the other Defendants.  In summary, it seems to me that the mutual interest of the CLR and the Bank in the redemption/non-redemption question provides an additional reason for keeping the Bank in the action, if the Estate can obtain permission, now, to put a re-amended case against the Bank.          </p>

I have considerable sympathy for the Bank’s complaints about the conduct of the Estate, in relation to the proposed re-amendment of its case.  The giving of a final opportunity to the Estate to retrieve the position may be said to lie at the limit of what is permissible, in terms of the practice of the courts when dealing with strike out applications.  The Estate may be said to have been lucky to escape from a simple strike out of its case against the Bank.  All that said, it seems to me that the decision on what to do on a strike out application is necessarily sensitive to all the facts and circumstances of the relevant case.  In the unusual circumstances of the present case, and considering and balancing all the relevant arguments and factors, I have come to the conclusion that the Estate should have a final opportunity to retrieve the position, in terms of its case against the Bank.          </p>

It is reasonable to assume that at least some of the work of preparing the draft of the Re-Amended Particulars of Claim, to be attached to the application to re-amend, has already been done in the drafting of the RPOC.  Subject to hearing any argument on this question, I have in mind a period of no longer than 28 days.  </p>
