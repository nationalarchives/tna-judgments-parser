He had married twice. His first marriage to Joan Fitzhugh was dissolved in around 1978, his second marriage to Irene ended in her death in December 1988. At the date of his death, he was survived by nine children. They were all the children of himself and his first wife Joan. The nine children, in order of seniority in the family, were as follows: Jeffrey, the eldest, was born in 1941. The next was Maureen, followed by Joan, followed by Colin, followed by Marion, followed by Harry Junior, then Yvonne, then Amanda, and then Anthony. </span></p>

It is also relevant to refer to the fact that Joan and Marion live in different places in the United States of America. Amanda, also known as Mandy, I was told had a mental illness.

The four administrators to whom letters were granted were the four boys in the family, Jeffrey, Colin, Harry and Anthony. That was the position in 1995. Of course, following the death of Colin and Jeffrey, as I have described, the administrators became two only, namely Harry and Anthony. That has been the position since 2001 and is the current position. </span></heading>

I have been shown a plan on which the areas of land and buildings have been numbered plots 1 to 6. A detailed description of the land and buildings can be found in a report of an agreed joint expert and I will not recount all of the detail of that description, I will attempt a more concise statement of what is involved. </span></heading>

              <p class="1-1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Plot 1 consists of a substantial farmhouse and garden. It is shown edged red on the plan to which I have referred. Plot 2 consists of some barns around a courtyard. The plan shows plot 2 as a square or rectangle, although on the ground I think it is not quite as regular as the plan would suggest. Plot 2 is shown coloured yellow. Plot 3 is something of a mixture. There appears to be a substantial surfaced open yard and not in very regular positions at the perimeter of the yard there are some further buildings. The expert's report, as I have said, describes the construction of these buildings in detail. Suffice to say that they are not so substantial as the barns around the courtyard in plot 2. Behind the open yard and the buildings in plot 3 there appears to be some open farmland. Plots 4 and 5, which are respectively to the south and to the north of plot 3, consist of farmland. Plot 6 is on the other side of the road from the plots I have already described. Plot 6 is principally a field, but at the edge of the field by the roadside there is a cottage which has been variously described as Primrose Cottage or Rose Cottage. </span></p>

That showed that the layout in earlier times was not quite what it has become more recently. If one takes acreages from this plan, plot 4 together with some part of plot 3 is approximately 3.9 acres and plot 5 together with some part of plot 3 is some 4.6 acres. These acreages and the field numbers are indeed used in one of the documents to which I will later refer.</span></heading>

There are a number of matters in dispute. There are two matters where the dispute is a considerable one. The first relates to whether a meeting took place on 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> March 1998, and if so who attended that meeting and what happened.

It is, however, relevant to refer to six witnesses, three who gave evidence for the claimant, Harry, and three who gave evidence for the defendant, Anthony. For the claimant, the three witnesses are Harry himself, Judith, the widow of Colin, and Joan Bishal, who was the partner of Jeffrey. On the defendant's side the three witnesses are Anthony himself, Karen Body, his long-term partner, and Joan Beers, who is one of the siblings, originally Joan Fitzhugh. </span></p>

            <content>
              <p class="1-1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Of these witnesses, the witness whom I find it easiest to assess is Judith Fitzhugh. She gave important evidence about the meeting or the alleged meeting on 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> March 1998. She produced a note, which she said was contemporaneous, which contained important information about what happened at that meeting. She appeared to me to be a transparently honest witness. I put it that way because what is said by Anthony through his Counsel about Judith is that Judith has participated in a very deliberate, dishonest, perjured fabrication of documents and untruthful evidence to the court. I will explain in due course my findings in relation to that, but suffice it to say at this stage that I regard that suggestion of fabrication as being wholly without any foundation. Although the allegation of fabrication was put in terms to Harry Fitzhugh, my note does not suggest that it was put in anything like clear terms to Judith Fitzhugh herself. I am not in a way surprised it was not put to Judith Fitzhugh. It would have been an obviously inappropriate suggestion to make to that witness. Suffice to say that I accept the main thrust of her evidence. It may be that she is not able to recall every matter of detail, but that in itself after the passage of time is not surprising.</span></p>

I am not prepared to accept Anthony Fitzhugh's evidence on any significant matter where it conflicts with the evidence of the claimant. I am quite satisfied that he is wrong about the events of 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> March 1998. I base that finding on the contemporaneous documents, the inherent probabilities, the veracity of other witnesses who conflict with him, and the self interest which he has in the evidence which he gave. I am also satisfied that he is wrong about the communications he had with the Solicitor in the period March or April 98 to July 1998 essentially for the same reasons as I gave when I rejected his evidence in relation to the meeting of 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> March 1998. </span></p>

Sometimes a witness genuinely misremembers the events, sometimes a witness persuades himself that events happened or did not happen when, objectively speaking, the position is otherwise, sometimes a witness deliberately attempts to mislead the court and gives evidence that he knows to be untrue. In this case, because Anthony Fitzhugh is an administrator and because I am asked to remove him, essentially because he is unfit to be an administrator, I think I ought to express my finding as to how it comes about that Anthony Fitzhugh has given the evidence which he has given. I am satisfied that at least in part of the evidence he gave, he must have appreciated that the evidence which he gave was not true.</span></p>

I am satisfied by the totality of the evidence that she is wrong about that. I do not find that she is deliberately misleading the court. I think that she has forgotten or misremembered. She also may be influenced by some degree of hostility to other family members, in particular Harry. It is fair to say that there were signs that that hostility was reciprocated, which is unfortunate. At any rate, I have expressed my view as to the overall reliability of her evidence.</span></p>

He died intestate. The four sons took out letters of administration and decisions had to be made as to what was to be done with the assets in the estate. At an early stage, it seems to have been decided that it would not be a good idea to sell off all of the land, plots 1 to 6. I think I was told that Harry Fitzhugh Senior himself before his death had expressed the wish that the land should be retained, that the prospect of planning permission should be pursued, and the land should be sold as development land with the benefit of planning permission. At any rate, that is what the family appeared to agree should happen. So they had these parcels of land, they were not going to sell them in the immediate future, and of course the land had to be dealt with in some way. It is not necessary for the purpose of this judgment to describe the initial arrangements which involved Jeffrey and his wife occupying the farmhouse and making some use of some of the land at any rate, but I will refer to the dates of some of the meetings of which there are written notes.</span></heading>

However, in this case no one says that the note had contractual effect, so I do not as such have to enforce it or give effect to it. Furthermore, there are, despite the care with which the note was prepared, there are real ambiguities in the record of the arrangements. There are a number of far from straightforward questions as to what was to happen in certain events. It may be the parties had not thought through all the possibilities. That is not a criticism of them. They appear to have thought that the day would soon come when planning permission would be obtained for some part of the land and the land would increase in value, be sold, and the proceeds dealt with.</span></p>

There appears to have been a distinction drawn between four family members who would participate in one way and four family members who would participate in another way. It seems to have been contemplated that the figure of </span><span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">250,000 would be divided by nine, giving a figure of approximately </span><span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">25,777. That sum would be paid to Jeffrey, that sum would be paid to Colin, that sum would be paid by instalments to Maureen and to Harry, but the other family members, if one leaves out Anthony there were four other family members, Amanda, Joan, Marion and Yvonne, they were not to receive that sum of money certainly at that stage. They were to do something which was called 'staying in.' 'Staying in' appears to have involved them waiting until the land was sold. When the land was sold, the first </span><span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">200,000 would be treated separately from the remainder of the proceeds, and that </span><span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">200,000 would be split four ways between the persons who were 'staying in.' So take the case of Joan, instead of her receiving </span><span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">25,777 in the same way that four family members were, she would instead eventually get a quarter of </span><span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">200,000 and then her one ninth share of any further proceeds of sale. </span></p>

When I say most of them, I refer to the fact that not only is there writing on the front of the page, there is also writing on the back of the page. It is possible that the writing on the back of at least one page was placed there at a different time and does not itself record anything said on 22</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">nd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> March 1998.</span></p>

The letter to Harry simply recorded that the Halifax had offered to lend on the security of the property. The letter to Anthony is more revealing. Mr Wilson wrote this, "Please will you arrange an appointment to call and see Mr Wilson and confirm whether the instructions given to us by Harry in connection with the transaction are correct. We also note that the loan is being taken in the names of yourself and your partner, Miss Body." That shows that Mr Wilson wanted to have Anthony's confirmation that the transaction he was engaged in as stated by Harry accorded with Anthony's instructions also. There is obvious sense in the Solicitor asking for that confirmation. I was given evidence by Harry, which I accept, that the Solicitor said to Harry that he could only act for both sides if both sides gave the same instructions as to what was to be done. </span></p>

On or about that date, the date on the copy is not legible, Mr Wilson sent to Anthony at the farm a document which identifies certain sums payable. Anthony accepts that he must have received this letter because he did pay the sums in question, indeed he gave me evidence as to his reaction to the mathematics contained in the letter. More significantly for present purposes is the fact that the letter states that there was enclosed with the letter a copy of the conveyance and a copy of the licence. Now, it is possible of course that the letter came but the enclosures were omitted. If that were so, one would have expected Anthony to communicate with the Solicitor and say, "Please send on the enclosures." There is no sign of that being done. It is more probable than not simply from the contents of the letter that the conveyance and the licence did accompany the letter. Anthony denied ever having seen the conveyance and the licence, but I reject that evidence. </span></p>

There is a dispute about the circumstances, but I need not resolve it. I was also told by Karen Body that she had heard of this incident and she had rung the Solicitors who were thought to be acting for Harry and asked was this true, that rent was owing, and her understanding was that the Solicitors were going to get back to her.

              <p class="1-1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In fact, that takes me conveniently to a letter that was written in February 2006 on this and other subjects. On 16</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> February 2006 on the instructions of Harry, one of the two administrators, the firm of Walker, Kerry &amp; Wilson wrote to Anthony and Karen. I will read parts of the letter as it is material to the present legal position. The Solicitor writes, "I have been instructed to write to you on behalf of all the family members of the late Harry Fitzhugh Senior regarding his estate. In particular, there are concerns about the terms and conditions in the licence which was drawn up on 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">rd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> July 1998 at the same time as the farmhouse and area marked red on the attached map was completed. As I am sure you are aware, the licence was personal to you and allowed you only to graze the fields on the farmhouse side of the road and park two motor vehicles in the farmyard. For this you were required to make an annual payment of </span><span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">1, the licence fee. In breach of the terms of that agreement, you have let persons use the farm buildings, for which you have charged them rent, and you have failed to pay the licence fee, thus you are in breach of the agreement in both respects."</span></p>

However, Mr Clarke, who appears on behalf of Harry, has made it clear that the only document he relies upon as being a notice for the purpose of Clause 4(b) of the licence is this letter of 16</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> February 2006.

The first is that the letter states that Anthony and Karen have failed to pay rent. They are asked to pay rent within seven working days. The sum involved is a modest sum of </span><span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">7. It has not been suggested that seven days was too short a period, an unreasonable period, within which that payment could have been made. The second comment is that the letter refers to other breaches apart from non-payment of rent. It seems to refer to persons other than the licensee using the farm buildings. It also refers to money being charged to those persons. However, when one comes to what the letter requires the licensee to do, the licensee is not asked to stop persons using the farm buildings, nor indeed to desist from use of the buildings otherwise than for keeping of animals. Instead what is required is that the licensee clarify in writing the position regarding the leasing of land and/or buildings to third parties. There is also a request for clarification in relation to Primrose Cottage.</span></p>

              <p class="1-1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">One other point on the letter. On the facts, Anthony was the recipient of this letter, he had not given any express instructions to the Solicitors to send the letter, he had not authorised Harry to send the letter, and it has not been suggested that the office of administrator was such that one joint administrator has implied authority to act on behalf of both administrators in this respect. I am not going to give a ruling on whether that is the case or not, but it has not been put forward as the position in relation to this letter. </span></p>

I will then consider the question of the administrators</span><span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">=</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> duty to account, and in particular Anthony's duty to account.

            <p class="1-1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">So I will embark on that, beginning with plot 1. There is in fact no contention as to plot 1. The freehold of plot 1 has been conveyed to Anthony and Karen. Although there might have been an intention that they would be subject to an option in favour of the administrators or a right of pre-emption in favour of the administrators, that is not the position. I think I may not have read out Clause 5 of the licence. That provides in accordance with Harry's instructions to the Solicitors for an offer to be made to the licensee, but it does not oblige the licensee to convey unless the licensee chooses to do so. That might not have been fully understood and it may not have been intended, but there is no application in this litigation for rectification of Clause 5 of the licence, so Anthony and Karen are free to retain the farmhouse and garden as they see fit. Although the farmhouse and garden was conveyed to them at a time when Anthony was an administrator, there is no application for any of that transaction to be set aside for any alleged breach of the self-dealing rule. That is all I need to say about plot 1.</span></p>

            <p class="1-1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Then I go to plot 2. It is quite clear that plot 2 was not conveyed to Anthony and Karen. There is no possible way of reading the conveyance as including any part of plot 2. It is not said that there was a contract which obliges the administrators to convey plot 2 to Anthony and Karen. In particular, it is not said that the agreement of 11</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> February 1997 had contractual force at any time. In the course of argument, there was discussion as to whether the circumstances put forward by Anthony could give him something in the form of an equitable interest, not pursuant to a contract, but something possibly arising by way of a proprietary estoppel. It is useful to consider the ingredients of a proprietary estoppel, even though I think in the end Mr Howlett did not put his case quite this way. </span></p>

            <p class="1-1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">If one was to investigate the existence of a proprietary estoppel in this case, it would be appropriate to consider Anthony and Karen's state of mind, their belief or alleged belief as to ownership of an interest in plot 2. It would be necessary to investigate the change in their position, for example by spending money on plot 2. It would also be necessary to investigate the state of mind of Harry as the other administrator, his awareness of the situation. And finally, one would ask whether it was inequitable for the administrators to proceed on the basis that Anthony and Karen had no equitable interest in plot 2. Anthony does indeed say that those ingredients should be found in his favour. He says he and Karen did believe they were the freehold owners of plot 2. He expended substantial sums on the buildings. He did it in the belief I have mentioned. He says that Harry knew of the work, Harry knew of the belief and Harry stood by.</span></p>

It does seem that something was spent, and it may have been thousands of pounds, possibly tens of thousands of pounds. The evidence is not satisfactory as to who spent that money on the building. Admittedly on a hearsay basis there is evidence that most of the expenditure was by a company, All Foundations Limited. Anthony's interest in that company was not spelt out in detail in the evidence, although the suggestion was that it was a 50% interest. I have not however been given more information about the company. I can admit the possibility that Anthony is a shareholder in All Foundations Limited, will suffer a personal advantage if the company spends a substantial sum on the buildings and then does not derive a long-term benefit from that expenditure. I have to say that it would be difficult to make more confident findings in that respect. </span></p>

I make that finding because the parties had discussed and agreed at an earlier point that the barns were not to be converted. It is entirely believable that when Anthony went ahead unilaterally and started converting a barn that Harry objected, Anthony went on regardless. Harry said there was not very much he could do about it. I accept that evidence. He was not in a position, he felt, given the family relationship if nothing else, to be more active in preventing Anthony proceeding as Anthony was determined to proceed.</span></p>

If in due course plot 2 is sold, then in my judgment the full amount of the proceeds are owned by the estate at law and in equity and are to be distributed in accordance with the law of intestacy, whereby each surviving child of the deceased gets one ninth of the proceeds. I reject the suggestion that one should calculate whether the proceeds of sale were enhanced by some improvement work done to one barn and then that enhancement in value if one could determine it is to be regarded as belonging to or payable to Anthony alone. </span></p>

Harry explained, and I find that Anthony well knew this, that the payment of rent was for the purpose of making it quite clear that Anthony was not in adverse possession of the land, so that as the years went by whilst planning permission was awaited Anthony could not say he had acquired a possessory title by adverse possession.

In other words, they failed within the period the licensor specified to rectify the breach. It is also accepted that the court does not have any power to relieve against the operation of this provision. As is well known in the case of a tenancy, the court has power to relieve against forfeiture for non-payment of rent, and we are in a somewhat similar territory here. I think it is also right that in some contractual circumstances, there is a right to relieve against forfeiture of an interest provided that the interest can be described as a proprietary or as a possessory interest, but outside that area the operation of termination provisions in commercial contracts do not give the court a jurisdiction to grant relief against their operation.</span></p>

It seems to me to be unsatisfactory to stop the reasoning at that point. I think one has to take account of the fact that there is something of an overlap between the persons who are the licensor and the persons who are the licensee. One can generalise the point in this way by asking this question, if the licensor is A plus B and the licensee is B, can A act alone in giving a Clause 4(b) notice to B? If it is necessary for the notice to be given by A and B alone then it is very unlikely if not certain that B will not on a voluntary basis join in giving that notice. Does this mean that an effective notice cannot be given to B or is it the case that A must apply to remove B as a trustee? If A and B are joint owners then they will necessarily be trustees. In this case, did Harry have to apply to remove Anthony as administrator before the administrators could then serve notice under Clause 4(b)? Another alternative possibly would be instead of removing Anthony as administrator or removing B as a trustee, the other fiduciary owner can go to court and possibly obtain an injunction requiring B, or in this case Anthony, to join in the service of a notice. </span></p>

It also seems to me that a requirement in my example of A and B that A gets B removed or A gets an injunction requiring B to serve a notice on himself is equally a cumbersome, slow, expensive proceeding which I hesitate to think the parties intended. There is in my judgment a solution to these difficulties. The solution is to construe the reference to the licensor in Clause 4(b) as referring to all persons who together are the licensor apart from any person who is also the licensee. If that is the construction of the word licensor in Clause 4 (b) then the notice can be given by Harry alone, and this notice, being so given, was an effective notice. </span></p>

It did not consider a contractual notice between a landlord and a tenant or between a licensor and a licensee. It was concerned with the service of a counter-notice by a tenant of an agricultural holding under the relevant legislation. The legislation required the counter-notice to be given by the tenant. Where there were joint tenants, all the joint tenants generally speaking had to join in giving the counter-notice. However, the question was raised, what if one of the joint tenants was also the landlord or one of the joint landlords? That very question was considered by Lord Justice Slade in an </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">obiter</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> passage at page 876(f) to 877(c). </span></p>

It is somewhat easier in my assessment to imply into a contractual arrangement a qualification if one applies established principles as to the implication of contractual terms. That subject as to implying contractual terms has recently been the basis of the decision of the Privy Council in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Attorney General of Belize v Belize Telecom Limited</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, to which brief reference was made in the course of argument yesterday, that is reported at [2009] 1 WLR 1988. Although it is a decision of the Privy Council, it has repeatedly been followed by courts in this jurisdiction ever since.

            <p class="1-1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">There is one further argument which seems to me to be worthy of consideration. I revert to my example of A and B being the licensor and B being the licensee. A and B will be joint owners and necessarily trustees. In a case where the facts permit a notice to be given under 4(b), that is a case of grave or persistent breaches by the licensee, there must be a very strong argument that B's duty as trustee, assessing him in that capacity, is to join in a notice to himself under 4(b). If he fails to join in that notice he is acting in breach of trust, he is committing a wrong to his fellow trustee A and the beneficiaries under the trust. If he then receives a notice from A alone and is able to challenge that notice on the ground that it is given by A alone and not by A plus B, he is in a real sense taking advantage of his own breach. There is a principle, whether it is a general principle of law or a principle of interpretation it matters not, that one should not take advantage, the court should not permit one to take advantage, of one's own breach. That is a powerful argument for holding that when one comes to the word licensor in Clause 4(b), one should interpret it as referring to everyone who is not also a licensee.</span></p>

It also seems that by 3</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">rd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> July 1998 when the licence was entered into, Anthony was engaged in a piling business in some way. My conclusion is the piling business expanded significantly after July 1998. My conclusion is that the move from the office in the farmhouse to the barn was after July 1998, but I think it is more probable than not that Anthony parked a vehicle or vehicles in the yard before July 1998, and I would hesitate to hold that that user was not permitted. He was not permitted in terms by the written licence, it may be that there was an informal permission. It is also clear that after July 1998 Harry did acquiesce in the user for the piling business, although he had objected to the conversion works to the barn. That is all I need say about the facts.

Harry asks me to remove Anthony as an administrator, Anthony asks me to remove Harry as an administrator. I could therefore remove one or both of the present administrators. If I remove one I will have to appoint one new administrator. If I remove two I will have to appoint two new administrators. The position of Anthony and Harry is quite different, although the net result is, largely because of the realistic attitude adopted by Counsel advising their clients, that both Anthony and Harry should no longer continue as administrators. I think it is only right to say that I do however see a very big difference between the two cases. </span></p>

Anthony has got his share by not being charged more than <span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">,</span>111,000. I am very much thinking aloud, and none of this I have given any real thought to. Well, let us rule out a number of things, because that way we might hit the target.

It cannot be right that four or five benefit and four do not, that cannot be right, for administrators to act that way. So the question is whether <span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">,</span>111,000 is considered as four fifths grossed up to five fifths <span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">,</span>138,000 or whether it is considered eight ninths grossed up to nine ninths, one ninth goes to Anthony, so you would divide <span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">,</span>111,000 by eight.

Because I think I indicated that there was some user at 3<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">rd</span> July and then there was at least a corroboration of other users, and anyway Anthony is being forced by the planners to go elsewhere. By the time you are ready to throw a notice at him, he might be compliant with the user. It strikes me that it might matter, and it might matter as regards to the account, because there is a difference in my assessment between the period up to termination of the licence and the period after termination of the licence. Up to the termination of the licence, he has got quite a lot of land for <span style="font-family:'WP TypographicSymbols'">,</span>1, after the termination of the licence he does not. Tell me if that is wrong, I am not here to jump to conclusions, I am here to consider what the parties say and then reach a decision. My instinct is to say that this is a case where I should give permission. I am not encouraging the parties in any sense, but it is a legal point, it is not straightforward, I said it was not straightforward. Mr Howlett may feel a little aggrieved that I developed the argument a little bit myself which was not ventilated for him in court. He might want to go to the Court of Appeal when he has had time to think about it. My assessment is that it would be fair to give him permission.</p>

It is said to be disproportionate for you to go to the Court of Appeal and I think it is being said that the Court of Appeal would take a very poor view of the argument that allows you to say, "This licence cannot be terminated until Anthony is removed or injuncted to joining in the notice."

I suppose it is right to say that we can maybe incorporate something to say that if a notice of appeal is lodged then the taking of such account is to be stayed pending that appeal.</p>

Let met ask Mr Howlett, is there any reasoned argument you can put forward to oppose that? I am minded to stay the taking of the account, but not stay the assessment of costs.</p>
