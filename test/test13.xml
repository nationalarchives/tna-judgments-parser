      <p style="text-align:justify"><br /><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">(1) A decision of the Upper Tribunal to refuse permission to appeal against a decision of the First-tier Tribunal disposes of proceedings in the Upper Tribunal. Except for its power to set aside under rule 43 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008 for procedural irregularity, the Upper Tribunal cannot revisit its decision. As a result, it has no jurisdiction to entertain subsequently-formulated grounds of challenge to the First-tier Tribunal’s decision.</span></p>

      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in"><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> (a) the Upper Tribunal’s reaction to the grounds of challenge in the application for permission to appeal was arguably wrong in law; or</span></p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">The appellants are citizens of Nigeria, a mother and her son, born respectively in 1987 and 2015.  On 24 January 2018, they made human rights claims to the respondent.  On 6 June 2018, the applications were refused.  It was noted by the respondent that the first appellant had arrived in the United Kingdom in 2002, with entry clearance as a visitor.  She was granted leave to remain in February 2013, on the basis of her private life, until 15 August 2015.  On 11 August 2015, she was granted further leave to remain, again on the basis of her private life, until 19 February 2018.  The first appellant told the respondent that her husband, the father of the second appellant, resided in Nigeria; and that she had family life with the second appellant, who resides with her in the United Kingdom.  </span></p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Given that the first appellant did not fall within the provisions of the relevant immigration rules for leave to remain as a partner, her application was considered by reference to the first appellant’s genuine and subsisting parental relationship with the second appellant.  The second appellant, however, was not a British citizen or settled in the United Kingdom; nor had he lived in the United Kingdom continuously for seven years or more.  Thus, although the parental relationship was acknowledged, the respondent considered that application made by reference to the child fell for refusal under the rules.  </span></p>

            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">The respondent found that the first appellant had not lived continuously in the UK for at least the last twenty years.  She was also over the age of 18.  She was not between 18 and 25 years.  This meant that the only way in which the first appellant could satisfy paragraph 276ADE was by reference to sub-paragraph (1)(vi).  The respondent accordingly addressed the issue of whether there would be very significant obstacles to the first appellant’s integration into Nigeria.  The respondent considered there would not.  The first appellant had spent her formative years living in Nigeria and would be familiar with the language and culture there.  The first appellant had a husband living in Nigeria, who had business interests in the country.  All of that would, according to the respondent, enable the first appellant to integrate into Nigeria.  She had been to Nigeria since entering the United Kingdom.  For these reasons, the respondent concluded that the first appellant did not meet the requirements of paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).</span></p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">As for the second appellant, the respondent’s attention also focused on paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi).  The respondent considered that there would not be very significant obstacles in the case of the second appellant because he would be relocating to Nigeria with his mother and would be supported by her there whilst he integrated.  Furthermore, the second appellant’s father resided in Nigeria and would also be able to supply support.</span></p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">The letter of refusal concluded by considering exceptional circumstances.  It was noted that the second appellant was born in the United Kingdom and that the first appellant was in employment there.  Although the second appellant might be currently enrolled in education in the United Kingdom, it was clear to the respondent from objective information that Nigeria had a functioning education system, which the second appellant would be able to enter.  Although it was generally accepted that the best interests of a child whose parent was facing removal from the United Kingdom were best served by the child remaining with the parent, given that the first appellant would be removed with the second appellant, and that the first appellant was “clearly the most important person in [the second appellant’s] life … this will help him to readapt to life in Nigeria”.  Although the first appellant had family and friends in the United Kingdom, these ties were not considered to be strong enough to engage article 8. </span></p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">The appellants appealed against the refusals to the First-tier Tribunal.  Following an appeal heard at Taylor House on 26 June 2019, First-tier Tribunal Judge S J Clarke dismissed the appeals in a decision promulgated on 8 August 2019.  The judge heard evidence from the first appellant, and from the first appellant’s mother and sisters.  The first appellant told the judge that her marriage to her husband in Nigeria had ended in June 2017.  Amongst the findings made by the judge were those at paragraph 17 of her decision, where it was recorded that the mother of the first appellant had recently spent six months in Nigeria, looking after her own mother.  The judge found that this demonstrated there was a base from which the first appellant and the second appellant could begin their life in Nigeria.  At the end of paragraph 17, the judge found that “the appellant’s mother is currently remitting money for some of their children by bank transfer and I find she is able to assist the appellant should the need arise”.  </span></p>

The decree absolute produced by the first appellant specifically referred to the father paying for the school fees of the second appellant and specifically stated that “it is not limited to this”.  </span></p>

At paragraph 23, the judge noted that the second appellant would return to a network of family living in the same state as the father of the second appellant “who may or may not assist with his upbringing, but even if he does not, there remain some financial assistance from the grandmother and the first Appellant owns an asset in the form of a house …”.  The first appellant also had “transferrable skills and is able to provide for her son in Nigeria in some care related or nursing related activity”. </span></p>

The grounds of application to the First-tier Tribunal contended that the judge should have realised there was a reasonable contemplation that the first appellant’s private life “would not remain stagnant”.  This was said to be an error of law.  It was also submitted that the judge had failed to recognise that the first appellant’s qualification as a qualified registered adult nurse constituted an important public interest, given the shortage of nurses in the United Kingdom.  The grounds further contended that there were factual errors in the judge’s decision.  At paragraph 17, the judge was said to have wrongly recorded that the first appellant’s mother was able to support her financially.  The first appellant said that, in fact, it was the first appellant who provided financial support to her mother.  It was also untrue to say that the first appellant had grown up in a Remo speaking area.  The judge had misunderstood what was said at the hearing.  The language spoken in her grandmother’s village was Remo, which the first appellant did not speak or understand.</span></p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">On 6 January 2020, the Upper Tribunal refused permission to appeal.  At paragraph 2 of the refusing judge’s decision, he noted the alleged factual errors in the decision of the First-tier Tribunal.  At paragraph 3, the refusal categorised the grounds as “unarguable”.  The First-tier Tribunal Judge was entitled to find that the first appellant was unable to satisfy the requirements of the immigration rules.  As regards paragraph 276ADE, the refusal noted that the First-tier Tribunal judge had found that the appellants did not face “insurmountable obstacles to their integration in Nigeria”.  In reaching that finding, the First-tier Tribunal Judge had had regard to the history of the first appellant’s mother and found that the appellants had a base to start from in Nigeria.  The refusal specifically addressed the issue of whether the first appellant’s mother was able to remit money to her other children in Nigeria, only because she was financially supported in the United Kingdom by the first appellant.  The refusal noted that the First-tier Tribunal had not found that the appellants would necessarily have to call upon assistance from the first appellant’s mother.  On the contrary, the First-tier Tribunal Judge had found that the first appellant was a successful independent woman who had set up home and educated herself, and who was earning a good salary from an international pharmaceutical company.  She could speak Yoruba and, although there was a local dialect called Remo, that would not create an insurmountable obstacle.  The Upper Tribunal Judge considered that the assessment of an Article 8 claim “is always a highly fact sensitive task”.  Reading the determination as a whole the refusal of permission ended by stating that “it is quite clear that the conclusions of the judge as to the Article 8 appeal were supported by reasons open to the judge on the evidence before her, and the findings made”.</span></p>

The grounds of the judicial review application were settled by Mr Sharma.  He had not been involved in the proceedings up to that point.  Mr Sharma mounted a criticism of the decision of the First-tier Tribunal, which had not found any expression in the grounds accompanying the applications for permission to appeal to the First-tier Tribunal or the Upper Tribunal.  At paragraph 22 of the judicial review grounds, Mr Sharma submitted that, at paragraph 17 of her decision, the First-tier Tribunal Judge had misdirected herself as regards the test to be satisfied in paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) of the Rules.  The judge had described the test in terms of “insurmountable obstacles” to the integration of the appellants in Nigeria, whereas paragraph 276ADE(1)(vi) requires consideration of whether there are “very significant obstacles to” integration.  </span></p>

The grounds submitted that the first appellant’s visit to Nigeria in 2013 could not constitute such a change.  Nor could the fact that the first appellant had moved from her mother’s home.  The fact that the first appellant’s mother’s had contacts in Nigeria were, according to Mr Sharma’s grounds, irrelevant to the two initial grants of leave and therefore not of sufficient basis on which to depart from those previous decisions.</span></p>

A decision was, therefore, taken to attempt to put the newly formulated grounds before the Upper Tribunal in the form of an application for permission to appeal.  But the fundamental problem with this course of action was that such an application had already been made by the appellants’ previous representatives.  That application had been decided by the Upper Tribunal on 6 January 2020, when it refused permission to appeal.  That refusal was, unarguably, a decision that disposed of the proceedings in the Upper Tribunal.

The only way in which a decision that disposes of proceedings can be revisited by the Upper Tribunal is under rule 43 of the Tribunal Procedure (Upper Tribunal) Rules 2008: </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">Jan</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> (Upper Tribunal: set-aside powers) [2016] UKUT 336 (IAC); [2016] Imm AR 1437.

Section 104 (Pending appeal) of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provides that an appeal is pending during the period beginning when it is instituted and ending when it is finally determined (or in other circumstances not here relevant).  Section 104(2) provides that an appeal is not finally determined while (inter alia) “an application for permission to appeal under section 11 … of the Tribunals, Courts and Enforcement Act 2007 could be made or is awaiting determination”.  If Mr Sharma is right, there would be nothing to prevent an appellant from filing an unlimited number of applications for permission to appeal, within the requisite time limit, all of which would have to be determined by the Upper Tribunal.</span></p>

The mere fact that the purported application was made to the Upper Tribunal in the context of what was then an undecided “Cart” judicial review cannot invest the Upper Tribunal with a jurisdiction that it would otherwise lack. If the Upper Tribunal had formally responded to the 30 January “application” by stating that it could take no action, that decision of the Upper Tribunal could be judicially reviewed or appealed, since any decision of the Upper Tribunal is subject to one or the other form of challenge. But that does not affect the inescapable reality that the “application” of 30 January simply could have no material bearing on the High Court’s function of deciding the “Cart” judicial review.  The fact that the Upper Tribunal had been belatedly approached with arguments in favour of the grant of permission, which had not hitherto found expression, could not relieve the appellants of the burden of persuading the High Court that the grounds now advanced were such that – even though they had not been put to the Upper Tribunal – they nevertheless should have occurred to it, when examining the First-tier Tribunal’s decision.</span></p>
