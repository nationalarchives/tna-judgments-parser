            <content>
              <p class="Quote">“The consent of a patient shall not be required for any medical treatment given to him for the mental disorder from which he is suffering, not being treatment falling within section 57 or 58 above, if the treatment is given by or under the direction of the responsible medical officer.”</p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The sole issue that arises on this appeal is whether this provision sanctions compulsory treatment of a detained patient for any mental disorder which has been diagnosed by the clinicians, or whether it only authorises such treatment (in the case of a patient who has been made the subject of a restriction order under section 41(1)) for the mental disorder specified by the court under section 37(7) or by the Mental Health Tribunal (“the tribunal”) under section 72(5).   The judge, Sir Richard Tucker, preferred the first interpretation.  He said:</p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Thorold, on behalf of the defendants, observes that it is common ground that a patient can be dual qualified and submits that the reference in the section to the disorder from which he is suffering must refer to the actual disorder as diagnosed by the clinicians, and need not, and should not, be confined to the disorder or that part of the disorder classified by the Tribunal.</p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">I prefer Mr Thorold’s submissions. If Parliament had intended the mental disorder to be that classified by the Tribunal it would have said so. It is clearly a matter for the professional judgment and expertise of the clinicians in charge of B’s case to decide upon the best therapeutic regime for the disorder from which they assess him to be suffering. To conclude otherwise would be to put an artificial and strange interpretation upon the words of the section.” </p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The mental disorder specified by the court under section 37(7) in this case was a mental illness.  At all times, B was classified as suffering from a mental illness.

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Save for certain brief interludes, B has been a patient at Ashworth Hospital (“Ashworth”) since 1987.   He is 47 years of age.  He is currently detained under sections 37 and 41 of the Act pursuant to an order made by the Crown Court at Birmingham on 25 August 1987.   He had been convicted of the manslaughter of his girlfriend.  The mental illness specified by the court in making the hospital order was schizophrenia.  Most, if not all, of the clinicians who have had B under their care have been of the view that B also suffers from a psychopathic disorder, being a personality disorder (dissocial type).  B’s case has been considered by the tribunal from time to time.   He has always been classified as suffering from a mental illness, and not a personality disorder.  </p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 17 August 2000, he applied to the tribunal for an order that he be discharged from liability to be detained.  At that time, he was on the Shelley Ward at Ashworth, and his responsible medical officer (“RMO”) was Dr Kumurajeewa.  He submitted a report to the tribunal for the purposes of the hearing, stating that B most probably had a schizo-affective disorder of the manic type.  Keith Scholey, a psychologist, also submitted a report recommending that B should be placed on a “comorbidity” ward suitable for the needs of patients suffering from problems of both mental illness and personality disorder.  Reports were obtained from experts instructed on behalf of B.  Professor Sashidharan, a psychiatrist, advised that a diagnosis of personality disorder would be “totally inappropriate”.  Eric Bromley, a psychologist, questioned whether B should be detained either for mental illness or personality disorder.</p>

In his witness statement dated 27 June 2002, he explains that B is “one of the few patients for whom  the traditional classification systems do not provide a straightforward diagnosis.  He has been diagnosed as suffering from both a mental illness (schizophrenia) and a psychopathic disorder being a personality disorder (dissocial type), a diagnosis with which I completely agree”.  </p>

This is a personality disorder ward as is the Shelley Ward where he had been previously.   At para 5 of his statement, Dr Hughes explains that the reason for the transfer was “to treat the personality disorder traits of the patient”.</p>

Your client’s mental illness is controlled by medication and it would not be appropriate to transfer him to a mental illness ward given the comorbidity that exists and the outstanding difficulties as regards his personality disorder presentation. These should be addressed, as now, in a PD ward. This is not to say the best placement of your client in the Hospital will not be reviewed on a regular basis.”</p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his skeleton argument, Mr Thorold submitted that implicit in the challenge to the decision to detain B in a personality ward was the proposition that placement decisions within a hospital are justiciable, and that the designation by a hospital of a particular ward for a particular mental disorder would acquire “binding legal significance”.  Given the relief sought by B in his claim form (an order quashing the decision to detain him in a personality ward), this was an understandable response.  But in the light of Mr Hazlehurst’s statement and the argument advanced by Mr Gordon QC, it has become clear that the challenge is not to the compulsory placement of B in a personality ward per se.  Rather, it is to the compulsory treatment of B for a personality disorder in that ward.  In view of the unchallenged evidence of Mr Hazlehurst and, above all, para 5 of the statement of Dr Hughes, it is not surprising that, in his oral submissions, Mr Thorold did not seek to argue that B is not receiving compulsory treatment for a personality disorder.  It is for this reason that the only issue for resolution on this appeal is the true construction of section 63 of the Act.</p>

The Act provides a detailed and carefully worked out scheme for the admission of mentally disordered patients to hospital for treatment, the review of their condition from time to time, and their discharge when they are no longer liable to be detained.  As I shall seek to show, a theme that runs through the Act is that the liability to detention is linked to the mental disorder from which the patient is classified as suffering, and that this disorder is considered to be treatable by the person or body making the classification.  For convenience, I shall refer to this as “the classified disorder”, although it is to be noted that the language of classification is not used in the Act (save only in the heading to section 16 “reclassification of patients”).</p>

Thus, he may produce a report which has the effect of deleting an existing classified disorder (A), and substituting a new disorder (B), or, where appropriate, adding a new disorder (B) to an existing disorder (A).  The mechanism adopted by the statute for giving effect to the opinion of the medical officer that the patient is suffering from a mental disorder other than the form or forms specified in the application for admission is to provide for a deemed amendment to the application.  The application takes effect as if the “other” disorder were specified in it.

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, if section 63 does not permit the giving of medical treatment for non-classified mental disorders, there is an important lacuna in the Act.  The inability to administer medical treatment for such mental disorders in urgent cases would be a serious matter, and cannot have been intended by Parliament.  It is true that in the case of civil patients, and unrestricted criminal patients who are subject to hospital orders, there is no difficulty, since the appropriate medical officer can reclassify the patient by furnishing a report under section 16. But this speedy solution is not available in the case of restricted criminal patients.  In their case, the only route to reclassification is by a reference to the tribunal by the Secretary of State under section 71, with a view to the exercise by the tribunal of its power to reclassify under section 72(5).  This is a somewhat cumbersome process which takes time, and is not apt to deal with cases where there is an urgent need for reclassification.  </p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nor can the problem be overcome by recourse to the common law.  Mr Thorold accepts that, but for the Act, it would be open to the hospital at common law to administer essential medical treatment without the patient’s consent in those cases where he or she does not have the capacity to give consent, and in all cases of emergency, regardless of capacity: see the valuable analysis of Lord Goff of Chieveley in <span style="font-style:italic">In re F (Mental Patient: Sterilisation) </span>[1990] 2 AC 1, 72-78.  But he submits that the common law power to administer compulsory medical treatment to mental patients who are liable to be detained in a hospital has been impliedly removed by Part IV of the Act.  He relies by analogy on the decision of the House of Lords in <span style="font-style:italic">B v Forsey</span> [1988] SLT 572.  In that case, it was held that the powers of detention conferred on hospital authorities by the Mental Health Act (Scotland) Act 1984 are exhaustive, and that any power of detention which they might otherwise have possessed at common law have been impliedly removed by the statute. The provisions of the 1984 Act correspond, so far as material, with those of the 1983 Act.  Lord Keith of Kinkel delivered the principal speech.  At p 576 he said:</p>
          </intro>
          <subparagraph>
            <content>
              <p class="Quote">“In my opinion it is impossible to reach any other conclusion than that the powers of detention conferred upon hospital authorities by the scheme were intended to be exhaustive. Procedure is laid down for emergency, short term and long term detention. The period of short term detention might reasonably be expected to be long enough for an application for long term detention to be submitted to and approved by the sheriff under s.18. What happened in this case was that the petitioner’s condition appeared initially to be improving, so that an application under s.18 was not thought appropriate. Dr Mackay was of opinion that an application which turned out to be unnecessary would be upsetting and harmful to the patient. The petitioner’s condition suddenly and unexpectedly deteriorated, and by then it was too late to have an application submitted and approved before the expiry of the short term detention. That would appear to be a situation which was not in the contemplation of the framers of the legislation. However, I am of opinion that the provisions of ss.24(6), 25(5) and 26(7) are absolutely inconsistent with a possible view that the legislature intended that a hospital authority  should have a common law power to detain a patient otherwise than in accordance with the statutory scheme. That scheme contains a number of safeguards designed to protect the liberty of the individual. It is not conceivable that the legislature, in prohibiting any successive period of detention under provisions containing such safeguards, should have intended to leave open the possibility of successive periods of detention not subject to such safeguards. I would therefore hold that any common law power of detention which a hospital authority might otherwise have possessed has been impliedly removed.”</p>

In these circumstances, there is no room for the operation of the common law doctrine of necessity to authorise the compulsory treatment of mental patients who are liable to be detained in hospital.  </p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third point made by Mr Thorold is that, if the section 63 power is restricted to classified mental disorders, this will give rise to great practical difficulty in cases of comorbidity. Take a patient who suffers from mental disorder A (which by itself would justify detention in a hospital having regard to the criteria specified by the Act), and from mental disorder B (which by itself would not justify detention on the basis of those criteria).   Mr Thorold submits that it would be unfortunate if the patient can only be treated for disorder A without his consent.  Even worse if disorder B aggravates disorder A.  Such an outcome cannot have been intended by Parliament. It is in my view unfortunate that the respondent has not adduced any evidence to explain  how, and to what extent, if the judge’s construction of section 63 is wrong, this will cause real practical difficulty in cases of comorbidity. As it is, the court has had to make do with Mr Thorold’s assertions.</p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I cannot accept Mr Thorold’s submissions, and in large measure for the reasons advanced by Mr Gordon QC.  I do not think that Mr Thorold’s first (linguistic) point carries any weight.  There is nothing which clearly indicates that Parliament intended Part IV to apply to <span style="font-style:italic">any</span> mental disorder from which the patient is suffering while liable to be detained in hospital, whether classified or not. Compulsory medical treatment is a serious intrusion of a person’s autonomy. I would not impute to Parliament an intention to permit compulsory treatment unless this was expressed in clear and unambiguous language. It is important to underline the full reach of Mr Thorold’s submission: it is that section 63 authorises any forcible medical treatment for a non-classified mental disorder, even if it does not meet the emergency criteria stated in section 62(1). In my judgment, section 63 comes nowhere near to evincing a clear intention by Parliament to permit such treatment for non-classified mental disorder.  </p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is true that, if Part IV is considered in isolation from the rest of the Act, it might appear to apply to any mental disorder from which the patient is diagnosed as suffering, whether classified or not.  But Part IV must be interpreted in its context.  The Act contains detailed provisions for the admission to and detention in hospital of patients who suffer from classified mental disorders.  It also contains provisions which are designed to ensure that they remain liable to be detained only so long as they continue to suffer from classified mental disorders.  I have earlier set out the relevant provisions.   Part IV apart, Mr Thorold was unable to draw our attention to any provision in the Act which deals with non-classified mental disorders.  Part IV apart, the Act is no more concerned with non-classified mental disorders than it is with physical disorders.  The Act is concerned with mental disorders which are treatable and which justify detention for their treatment.   In these circumstances, I do not find it at all surprising that Part IV does not define the mental disorder for which medical treatment may be given without the patient’s consent as the classified mental disorder.  That is assumed.  Part IV is not dealing with the definition of the mental disorder: that is determined elsewhere in the Act.  Part IV is dealing with the very important ancillary question of defining the circumstances in which forcible treatment for the mental disorder may be given.</p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me, therefore, that the natural interpretation of section 63, when construed in its context, is that treatment (other than treatment falling within section 57 and 58) may be given without the patient’s consent, but only for classified mental disorders. It is at this point that it becomes necessary to examine Mr Thorold’s second and third submissions in order to see whether they cast doubt on the correctness of this interpretation.</p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, <span style="font-style:italic">B v Forsey</span> is distinguishable from the present case.  It does not compel the conclusion that, if the section 63 power may only be exercised in relation to classified mental disorder, the hospital authority has no power at common law to treat urgent non-classified mental disorder.   In <span style="font-style:italic">Forsey</span>, it was held, as a matter of statutory construction, that the Act of 1984 was exhaustive of the powers of detention in all circumstances, emergency, short term and long term.  It followed that there was no room for a power to detain at common law in cases of emergency.  Such a power would be truly concurrent with the statutory power, and had been excluded by the Act.  But the position with regard to treatment under section 63 is quite different.   The hypothesis under consideration is that section 63 may only be invoked in relation to a classified mental disorder.  On that hypothesis, section 63 plainly is not exhaustive of the power to treat for mental disorder.  It is only exhaustive of the power to treat for classified mental disorder. It simply does not touch non-classified mental disorder, because the Act is not concerned with such mental disorder, any more than it is concerned with physical illness.  It follows that, if a non-classified disorder is diagnosed, and the patient needs emergency treatment to which he or she cannot or will not consent, the common law doctrine of necessity allows the hospital authority to give the treatment.   There is no basis for saying that the common law doctrine of necessity has been removed by the Act in such circumstances.</p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I should add for completeness that, in his skeleton argument, Mr Gordon also suggested that section 3 of the Act provides a further alternative solution to the problem where there is a need for emergency treatment of a non-classified mental disorder: the patient can simply be admitted under section 3.  But section 5(1) specifies the circumstances in which a patient may be admitted under section 3 if he or she is already in hospital.  These are where the patient is an informal in-patient, or is already detained under an application for assessment under section 2.  They do not include the situation where the patient has already been detained under section 3 or 37.  In these circumstances, I think that Mr Gordon was right not to pursue this point in oral argument.</p>

          <intro>
            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I turn to comorbidity (of which the present case is an example).  The problem presented by comorbidity is inherent in the scheme of the Act.  At the very outset, the doctors who recommend the patient’s admission for treatment have to decide which mental disorder(s) are of a nature or degree which “make it appropriate for the patient to receive medical treatment in a hospital” (section 3(2)(a)).  Similar judgments have to be made by the doctor furnishing a report under sections 16 or 20, and by the tribunal when considering whether to direct a discharge under sections 72 or 73.   If a separately identifiable mental disorder does not satisfy the statutory criteria for compulsory detention, the patient cannot be detained or treated against his or her will for that disorder.  That applies at all stages of the process.  Thus, the patient cannot be admitted by compulsion for such a disorder, and may not continue to be detained for treatment for that disorder if it ceases to satisfy those criteria.  As for Mr Thorold’s example of disorder B (which alone does not justify detention) aggravating disorder A (which alone does justify detention), if treatment for disorder B is required to treat disorder A, it is difficult to see why treatment for disorder B is not ancillary to, and therefore a necessary part of, the treatment for disorder A. In <span style="font-style:italic">B v Croydon Health Authority</span> [1995] Fam 133, 138H  Hoffmann LJ said:</p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the example just given, the classified disorder is disorder A, but this classification authorises treatment for condition B as part of the treatment for condition A. I accept that patients who suffer from more than one mental disorder present particular problems for those who are charged with the sensitive and difficult task of caring for and treating mental patients.  But I am not persuaded that these problems compel a meaning of section 63 which is different from what I conceive to be its natural meaning.   </p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is directly relevant to the true construction of section 63, since, if that section permits compulsory treatment for any mental disorder which is diagnosed by the clinicians, whether it is classified or not, it is difficult to see what purpose is served by reclassification in sections 16, 20 or 72(5).  It is true that sections 16 and 20 do not apply to the present case, since they have no application to restricted patients, but section 72(5) does apply to all patients liable to detention, and anyway section 63 applies indifferently as between restricted and unrestricted patients.  If Mr Thorold is right, the purpose of reclassification is not to identify those mental disorders which justify a patient’s continued detention and for which compulsory treatment may be given. He is, it seems, unable to attribute any significant purpose to reclassification. </p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view, it is clear that the elaborate provisions in the Act for classification and reclassification are intended to serve a real purpose.  In <span style="font-style:italic">R v Pathfinder NHS Trust ex p Wey</span> 3 CCLR 271, the applicant was detained in hospital under section 3.  His classified mental disorder was “mental illness”. His disorder was reclassified as “mental illness and psychopathic disorder” under section 16.  The applicant appealed to the tribunal.  The tribunal made an order under section 72(5) reclassifying his mental disorder back to “mental illness”.  The appropriate medical officer then purported to exercise his section 16 power to reclassify his disorder yet again as “mental illness and psychopathic disorder”.  The applicant sought judicial review of this last decision.  The application succeeded before Kay J.  The issue was whether, without a significant change of circumstances, the medical officer could make a classification decision which was in conflict with that of the tribunal.  Kay J said that he could not do so.  He said:</p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In that case, the applicant was a restricted patient.  The hospital order specified that he was suffering from mental illness and psychopathic order which were of a nature or degree which made it appropriate for him to be detained in a hospital for medical treatment.  In other words, it was a comorbidity case  where, at the admission stage, both mental disorders were classified.  The applicant applied to the tribunal to be discharged under section 73.  The tribunal refused to discharge him.  It found that he continued to suffer from the psychopathic disorder, which continued to be of a nature and degree that required his detention in hospital for his own health and safety, and for the protection of others.  It also found that the applicant continued to suffer from the mental illness, which was at that time in remission, but that the mental illness taken alone would not justify his being detained.  Nevertheless, the tribunal decided not to exercise its power under section 72(5) to reclassify so as to remove from the hospital order the reference to the mental illness.  The applicant argued that, in view of its findings, the tribunal was bound under section 72(5) to delete the reference to mental illness in the hospital order.  This argument prevailed before Collins J.  The tribunal succeeded on appeal before Lord Woolf MR, Waller and Chadwick LJJ.  </p>

The central question for the court was whether on the facts of that case the tribunal had a discretion or was under a duty to reclassify pursuant to section 72(5), by deleting mental illness on the grounds that it was a mental disorder which would not by itself justify detention. The court held that the tribunal had a discretion. It is necessary to examine the reasoning of Waller LJ’s judgment in a little detail.  At para 19, he recorded the submission of Mr Gordon (who appeared for the applicant in that case) that it is not lawful to treat a patient compulsorily for any form of mental disorder other than one that is classified: the very submission that he makes on the present appeal.  Waller LJ said that it was unnecessary to decide whether this submission was correct, and that it was  “probably better to leave final resolution to a case where it is directly in issue”.</p>

Furthermore, I have no doubt that the requirement that there must be at least one common mental disorder as between two medical practitioners before an application is effective, is the touchstone for detention under section 3, but it clearly is not in one sense the touchstone for treatment in that instance because under section 16 one report from the appropriate medical officer stating that the patient is suffering from a different form of mental disorder will lead to the application being deemed to contain that different form.”</p>

It is, as it were, akin to a warrant or a Court Order justifying detention in, for example, a prison, because detention in a mental hospital is as much a deprivation of liberty as detention in any other sort of institution. Such a detention must be justified. The document shows third parties why a person is being detained and, therefore, should contain, and contain only, the reference to the form of mental disorder which justifies any current detention. </p>

              <p class="Quote">It will be noted that he commences with the words “purpose of classification”. I do not dissent from the view that at least part of the purpose of classification in the original form of application, and the court order under section 37 is to show the basis for the detention and at least part of the purpose is to identify the mental disorder for which compulsory treatment is needed (albeit the treatment aspect was not much pursued before the judge). It also seems to me that the reason why under section 16 a report may generate some other form of mental disorder being specified in the application has to do with the lawfulness or otherwise of continued detention pursuant to an application, and the purpose of substitution under section 72(5) has to do with ensuring that the order correctly reflects a basis for detention. But it does not follow in either case that the purpose of reclassification is to ensure that there is not described in the application or order a form of mental disorder from which the patient suffers and may need treatment if he continues to be detained on the basis of another form of mental disorder. Indeed the ordinary application of section 16 leads to that conclusion, and there is no reason why the Tribunal, under section 72(5), should be obliged to reach a different conclusion.</p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">Thus the judge was wrong to accept the submission that the purpose of reclassification wherever it appeared in the Mental Health Act was to ensure that there was not described in the application or the order a mental disorder from which the patient suffered but which would not on its own justify detention. In particular it seems to me the judge was wrong to accept the submission that the purpose of reclassification under section 72(5) was to describe accurately the basis on which the patient was lawfully detained. The patient was lawfully detained under an order of the court, and there was nothing inaccurate in describing him as being lawfully detained on the bases specified in the order. Furthermore, there is no warrant in my view for reading into the section that it is “incumbent upon [the Tribunal] to reclassify if it decides that one of the current forms of mental disorders, from which the patient is suffering which is contained in the order or application or direction which has led to his detention, is no longer appropriate … because the relevant mental illness is not of a nature or degree which makes it appropriate for him to receive medical treatment” where the conclusion of the Tribunal is that for another reason the patient is to be detained. Of course if the conclusion relating to the mental illness related to the only basis for detention, reclassification would not be appropriate but discharge either absolutely or conditionally would follow.</p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">I would finally add that there is in my judgment possibly a short answer to this case even accepting much of Mr Gordon’s submissions. The conclusion of the Tribunal was that the mental illness alone would not render him liable to be detained. That conclusion emphasises that Mr Hagan still suffers from mental illness, and that it may recur unless treatment was available. The conclusion I suggest can be fairly read as being that the mental illness, when taken together with the psychopathic disorder which can be alleviated by treatment in hospital, makes it appropriate for him to be detained in hospital for medical treatment in relation to both types of mental disorder. Clearly there could be no criticism of the Tribunal’s refusal to reclassify so as to delete the mental illness if that was their view.”             </p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I confess, with the greatest of respect, that I am unable to agree with some of that reasoning. The court in <span style="font-style:italic">Hagan</span> seems to have been of the opinion that classification is the touchstone for detention, but not necessarily for treatability.  Waller LJ states in various places that it is the touchstone for detention.  Thus at para 25, he says that the primary purpose of section 72(5) is to enable a tribunal which has concluded that the form of disorder which requires a patient to continue to be detained is different from the classified disorder to make a substitution “so as in effect to correct the order to accord with the position as it is now known to be”.   And at para 30, he says that (a) “at least part of the purpose” of an original classification is to show the basis for detention; (b) the reason why a section 16 report may reclassify a mental disorder “has to do with the lawfulness or otherwise of continued detention pursuant to an application”; and (c) the purpose of substitution under section 72(5) “has to do with ensuring that the order correctly reflects a basis for detention”. In these passages, Waller LJ is clearly saying that the reason for a reclassification under sections 16 or 72(5) is to provide a touchstone for lawful detention: to ensure that the application or hospital order (as the case may be) accurately describes the mental disorder which justifies the patient’s lawful detention in hospital.  </p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to whether classification provides the touchstone for treatability, Waller LJ sees force in the submission that it does (para 22); and at least part of the purpose of the original classification is “to identify the mental disorder for which compulsory treatment is needed” (para 30). But this did not require the removal from the order of a form of mental disorder from which a patient still suffers, even though that would not by itself justify detention (para 24).  </p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me that two factors played a considerable, and perhaps decisive, part in the conclusion expressed in para 24 to which I have just referred.  First he was of the opinion that an appropriate medical officer cannot reclassify under section 16 if he considers that one of two classified disorders no longer satisfies the section 3(2) criteria (para 22). This led to his point (also in para 22) that there was no warrant for adding by implication some duty on the medical officer to delete a mental disorder from which the patient suffers and may need treatment, albeit that this mental disorder alone might not justify detention.  But I do not see why the medical officer cannot reclassify in such a case (see para 21 above). At the outset, there are two classified disorders A and B.  The medical officer now considers that there is only one, A.  It appears to him that the disorder from which the patient is suffering (A) is “other” than the disorders which were specified in the application form (A and B). The importance of Waller LJ’s opinion as to the scope of section 16 in the reasoning that led to his conclusion about the meaning of section 72(5) is evident from para 26 and the last sentence of para 30 of his judgment.  </p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second important factor in Waller LJ’s reasoning is the concern expressed at para 19 about the implications of accepting Mr Gordon’s submissions as to the meaning of section 63.  Waller LJ speaks of an “unsatisfactory state of affairs” if the tribunal were bound to delete mental illness from the order since (1) the hospital could not treat the patient compulsorily so as to keep his mental illness in remission, and (2) even more worryingly, “could not treat him compulsorily if the mental illness came out of remission until they had gone through the Secretary of State route to get the order re-amended”.  No reference is made to the possible recourse to the power to treat under the common law doctrine of necessity.  It would seem that the relevance of this power was not brought to the attention of the court.</p>

For the reasons that I have given, neither of the factors which seem to have led the court in <span style="font-style:italic">Hagan</span> to its conclusion as to the meaning of section 72(5) justifies that conclusion.</p>

It is not sufficient merely that the patient was admitted (and indeed remains detained) because his condition was regarded as treatable.  Compulsory treatment must be authorised if at all under part IV of the Act.  As s.63 makes plain, it is a pre-requisite of such treatment that it shall be given "for the mental disorder from which [the patient] is suffering".  Without that it will be unlawful in any event.  Ss.57 and 58 then provide a range of safeguards graded to reflect the severity of the various treatments which may be contemplated.  S.57 (not here directly in point) is concerned with surgery for destroying brain tissue or other forms of severe and perhaps irreversible treatment prescribed by the Secretary of State and it precludes any such treatment being given compulsorily.  Rather it requires both the patient's capacitated consent, which must be certified to be valid by a panel of three persons including a SOAD, and also the SOAD's certified approval for such treatment having regard to the likelihood of it assisting the patient's condition.  S.58 applies to two defined forms of treatment for mental disorder: ECT and long-term medication.  These are forbidden save - and thereby, taken in conjunction with s.63, permitted only - upon the stipulated conditions.  These are that the patient has either (a) given a capacitated consent, so certified by the RMO or a SOAD, or (b) not given such a consent (or, indeed, indicated a capacitated refusal) but the SOAD, having consulted with two others as required, has nevertheless certified that the treatment should be given.”</p>

Section 58 (also subject to s62), however, does not always require the patient’s consent so that, were Mr Thorold’s submission correct, patients classified as suffering only from mental disorder A could be compulsorily subjected to the sorts of severe treatment provided for by s58 with regard to mental disorder B.

It may be doubted whether in those circumstances, given that the Tribunal found the appellant still liable to be detained on the ground of mental illness, they thought it necessary to give serious consideration to the exercise of their s72(5) power to re-classify him as suffering also, assuming they thought he was, from a psychopathic disorder.  To my mind, indeed, if one looks at the totality of the reasoning for their decision, it seems tolerably clear that they did not.  Dyson LJ in paragraph 9 above has set out the first part of the Tribunal’s reasoning.  It continued as follows:</p>

              <p class="Quote">“The RMO gave evidence in accordance with his report and its addendum.  He was emphatic that the patient had improved over the last 18 months.  That had allowed greater engagement with the care team.  The patient was still ill, and without medication and the structured care of the hospital, would relapse.  The RMO outlined a pattern of treatment which he considered should be put in hand before a transfer could be considered.  The risk factor was difficult to assess but was real.</p>

              <p class="Quote">Professor Sashidharan considered that the mental illness was controlled by the medication and that the patient’s outbursts in past years were due to the culture from which he came reacting against the regime of the hospital, rather than mental illness.  However, the Professor was specific that the patient wherever he was, must continue medication for fear of a relapse.</p>

              <p class="Quote">Mr Bromley echoed the Professor’s view that some of the patient’s behaviour was due to growing up in a criminal subculture, but agreed that the patient presented some risk, not readily quantifiable.</p>

              <p class="Quote">The patient was courteous and articulate.  He was anxious to say that the suffered no mental illness and had not for many years.  Questioned, he said that although mad at the time of the offence, he had already recovered by the time he came before the Crown Court for sentence.  He would take medication if it was enforceable but not otherwise.</p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Had the Tribunal appreciated that it would be unlawful to treat the appellant compulsorily in a personality disorder ward without re-classifying him as suffering from that disorder - indeed, that he was already being unlawfully treated in such a ward - it may be supposed that they would have addressed the issue of re-classification altogether more directly, rather than merely appearing to approve the RMO’s proposed pattern of future treatment.</p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Clearly, following our judgments on this appeal, the question of re-classifying patients to include other disorders will assume a far greater importance than hitherto it has had.</p>

            <p class="Heading1" style="margin-left:0.5in">These observations, however, cannot affect the outcome of the present appeal.  Clearly it succeeds so that unless and until the appellant is hereafter re-classified by a Tribunal as suffering also from a psychopathic disorder it will not be lawful to continue his treatment for that condition.</p>
