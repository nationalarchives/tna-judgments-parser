At a high level, the context may be described as follows. The complaint is of alleged improper threats made by a commercial counterparty (the Defendant) to disclose the content of private conversations between representatives of the other side to negotiations (the Claimants) which were overheard by the Defendant (from another room) in the course of a business acquisition meeting. </span></p>

            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Following a without notice hearing, Stacey J granted an interim non-disclosure order restraining disclosure of such private conversation (and any recordings of them) on 1 April 2022 (“the INDO”).  This is my judgment on the return day. The Claimants seek continuation of the INDO. The Defendant opposes that and argues that the INDO should never have been granted.</span></p>

The INDO was continued by a consent order made by Nicklin J on 11 April 2022, pending the contested hearing before me on 12 May 2022.  Pursuant to Nicklin J’s further directions, the parties have served pleadings (in addition to a number of additional witness statements). As often happens, the discipline of having to plead their cases has caused the parties to focus more clearly on their detailed legal and factual positions. </span></p>

I have concerns about the lack of clarity in the language of the restraints and that is related to the rather odd factual position in this case, where the Claimants cannot with precision identify the confidential information in issue. I referred to these concerns at the start of the hearing and invited submissions as to the potential modification to the scope of the injunction. Counsel for the Claimants accepted my suggestion as to how the injunction might be modified but Counsel for the Defendant, as he was entitled to do, maintained a root and branch opposition to any form of relief. The Defendant also declined to give any form of undertaking (despite having agreed in correspondence not to disclose anything to any third party).</span></p>

            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">I will begin with an outline of the facts. This case is at an early stage and a range of important factual issues are in dispute. Nothing I say represents any form of concluded finding but I will need to form a view as to the merits of the claims given that the enhanced test in relation to an INDO has to be applied. Section 12(3) of the Human Rights Act 1998 is engaged and the Claimants need to show more than merely the standard “serious issue to be tried” and need to satisfy me they are “more likely than not” to succeed: </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Cream Holdings v Banerjee</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> [2005] 1 AC 252 at [22].</span></p>

The major issue was the price of the Target within the context of a proposed transaction on the basis of a multiple of EBITDA. Within the Loughton offices there is a standard CCTV system that makes audio-visual recordings of events in those offices. There is a conflict of evidence as to how conspicuous that system was and what GG and JR knew (or should have appreciated) about such recording. The photographic evidence before me shows that entrants to the building are given a notice of CCTV recording, as is now commonplace (a sign says “CCTV in operation”). </span></p>

That is not surprising given that these were oral discussions some 20 months ago.

This is text I have taken from the Defence (para. 8) and I will refer to the first matter in the annexe as “Item A” and the second as “Item B”. While there is some overlap between these items and the four areas that the Claimants say were the subject of private conversations between GG and JR, Items A and B are much more limited.

He says that “with due regard to whether I may simply have been too sensitive I found what I heard rather disturbing”. On his own evidence, D’s actions when he heard these matters were somewhat strange. He said that on an “impulse which I cannot logically explain, probably because it was all I could do, I pressed the screenshot button on the visual recording system”. That screenshot is in evidence before me (and appears below when I set out the alleged threat).  His evidence is that there was no recorded soundtrack of what GG and JR were saying, although “…what the Second and Third Defendants had said was said loud enough for me with unaided hearing to hear through the partition wall”.  He adds that he was “frankly embarrassed to have heard” what was said but said nothing to GG and JR because part of the intended share purchase agreement was that he work with the Claimants after the purchase, and he wanted relations to be good.</span></p>

I find that difficult to follow: if D was not listening he would not have heard what was said about him. Furthermore, it is apparent from D’s own case that whilst GG and JR were alone in the meeting room D must have gone to a computer screen showing a livestream of the CCTV and deliberately viewed them. Unless he was viewing a screen showing the two of them, he could not have made the “screenshot”. I consider it likely he was watching them on screen at the same time as listening to them through the wall; as he states in his first witness statement, he “could clearly hear what the Second and Third Claimants were saying”, although he denies using the audio function of the CCTV livestream to listen to them electronically.</span></p>

A duty of confidence may arise when a person has notice that the information they receive is of a confidential nature, and D knew that GG and JR were having a private discussion. In the context of the commercial negotiations taking place on 13 August 2020, it would in my judgment be obvious to D that what was being discussed between GG and JR (when he had left) was private and confidential insofar as it extended to aspects of the proposed transaction and commercial intentions and future plans for the Target.</span></p>

The threat remains real. D has refused to give an undertaking in relation to information about the contents of GG/JR’s private discussions, even in the modified form I suggested at the hearing. I cannot at an interim stage decide whether the threat of disclosure was to be via social media (that is certainly an available reading) but that does not seem to me to matter given that I consider any reading indicates a threatened disclosure to third parties.</span></p>

It is a cardinal rule that a defendant should know with certainty what he is and is not allowed to do. I do not consider the term “private conversations” without any further and more precise identification of subject-matter to be sufficiently certain. It suffers from being both too broad (apt to cover something like a discussion of the weather - which is not worthy of protection) but also too vague for the court to police.</span></p>
