            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Bitumina International DMCC (“<span style="font-weight:bold">DMCC</span>”) was a company established in Dubai on 10 April 2019. It was owned by the Second Respondent, Mr Farah. Its main (and apparently only) asset appears to have been a cash balance of $2,350,000. On 22 November 2019, Mr Farah entered into a sale and purchase agreement (the “<span style="font-weight:bold">SPA</span>”) to sell DMCC to the Company in consideration of the issue by the company to him of 2,332,750 convertible secured loan notes of $1 each (the “<span style="font-weight:bold">Notes</span>”). The security for the Notes was to be constituted through a separately executed debenture granting a floating charge over the assets of the Company. The terms of the Notes were recorded in a document called the Convertible Loan Note Instrument (“<span style="font-weight:bold">CLNI</span>”).</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The SPA was executed on the 22 November 2019. It provided that completion should take place “immediately after the signing of this agreement”, at which point the shares in DMCC should be transferred and the Notes issued. </p>

It appears that this debenture was validly executed.

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The completion process of the SPA was protracted, since the UAE company law formalities relating to the transfer of the shares in DMCC took time to complete. Since the SPA had provided for completion to take place “immediately”, both parties were now in breach – the Company because it had not granted a valid  Debenture, and Mr Farah because he had not transferred the shares. During this period, the parties to the SPA clearly agreed to vary its terms to require the creation of another Debenture. A second debenture was created (the “<span style="font-weight:bold">Second Debenture</span>”), which was invalid on its face. However, nothing turns on that document. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It was therefore agreed between the parties that another Debenture (the “<span style="font-weight:bold">Third Debenture</span>”) should be executed on the same day that the share transfer was to be completed. This was 22 January 2020. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Third Debenture was formally invalid for two reasons. First, Mr Farah was both a party to it and witnessed the signatures of Mr Schmidt and Mr Hamoud (<span style="font-style:italic">Seal v Claridge</span> (1881) 7 QBD 516 at 519); and second, that the execution pages were not in fact executed, but the execution page of the Second Debenture was attached to it (<span style="font-style:italic">R (On the application of Mercury Tax Group) &amp; Another v HMRC</span>  [2008] EWHC 2721 (Admin)). It therefore  never took effect as a deed. It was, however, registered with the registrar of companies as a charge. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is not legally necessary for a floating charge to be granted in the form of a deed. Where parties bind themselves to create a charge,  purport to do it by deed, and the deed itself fails, the question becomes simply one of whether the steps taken by the parties, disregarding the deed, were sufficient to create a legally enforceable obligation on the chargor to apply the charged property in discharge of the secured obligation. It is common ground between the parties that that was the case here. A valid equitable charge (the “<span style="font-weight:bold">Charge</span>”) therefore came into existence at this time.  </p>

This renegotiation involved amendments to the terms of the Notes recorded in the CLNI, and these amendments were effected by the execution of a deed of amendment dated 23 April 2020 (the “<span style="font-weight:bold">Deed of Amendment</span>”). The question of whether the effect of the Deed of Amendment was in fact to cancel the existing Notes and replace them with new instruments is a significant point in this application.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">“When a charge is created, the debtor (the “chargor”) simply agrees with the creditor (the “chargee”) that certain assets (the “charged assets”) are to be appropriated to the discharge of a debt or other obligation. It is in the nature of a charge that it be made for consideration. If the security agreement is between debtor and creditor, there is inevitably consideration, but charges are not limited to agreements between these parties. What is critical is the existence of a specifically enforceable agreement creating the charge. This is because the existence of the equitable proprietary right relies on the chargee having a specifically enforceable right to have the charged property appropriated to the payment of the relevant debt or discharge of some other obligation. As Briggs J put it in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Lehman Bros International (Europe) Ltd</span>: “It is that right of specific enforcement which transforms what might have otherwise been a purely personal right into a species of proprietary interest in the charged property” ([2012] EWHC 2997)”.</p>

The sole asset of DMCC was its cash balance – in effect the Company was buying a box containing $2.3m in exchange for the issue of $2.3m of Notes. However, by buying the box, the Company did not obtain unrestricted access to its contents. Mr Farah controlled the bank account within which the $2.3m was held, and the Company could only access that money with Mr Farah’s active co-operation. Mr Farah allowed the use of the money to finance bitumen trading transactions, but for no other purpose. </p>

This caused the Noteholders a great degree of concern, to the extent that they almost called in the Notes. As a result, negotiations took place to reach a new agreement.

A key point here is that the form which the Notes took was that of registered notes whose existence is evidenced by certificates issued under seal by the Company. Curtis are said to have been concerned that the changes to the CSNI being made by the Deed of Amendment were so fundamental that they amounted to the cancellation of the existing Notes and the issue of new Notes. That led to the inclusion  in the Deed of Amendment of provisions requiring that the original Certificates dated 22 November 2019 be delivered up to the Company, and that they be replaced by new Certificates with new numbers issued on 23 April 2020 (the “<span style="font-weight:bold">Note Exchange</span>”).

By extending the maturity of the Notes from one year to two, it gained more time to raise external capital. Also, and importantly, Mr Farah agreed that the cash held in DMCC could be deployed elsewhere within the group. This was a somewhat limited concession, since the cash remained subject to the control of Mr Farah and could only be deployed with the consent of Noteholders. However, USD $1,726,849.80 of DMCC’s cash was deployed after  23 April 2020.</p>

In order to apply this rule to these facts, we need to know the date of the Charge’s creation, the date of the provision of any consideration to the Company, whether that consideration falls within the limited range of consideration which can be recognised as such by the section, and what the value of that consideration should be taken to have been.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The SPA imposed an unconditional contractual obligation on the Company to create a charge. It is very common for a contract to impose an unconditional obligation to create a charge by deed, but for the deed itself to be executed some time after the contract is entered into. The legal position where this is done is relatively well understood – the execution of the valid deed of charge vacates the obligations created by the original contractual charge. Gough on Company Charges (2nd ed)  suggests that this is because the contractual charge is extinguished through merger (pp 711-2) (see <span style="font-style:italic">Re Tyrrels Ltd</span> [1929] SASR 450), and I agree.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Re Gregory Love &amp; Co</span> [1916] 1 Ch. 203, there was an agreement to charge, which was registered, and a subsequent deed, which was also registered. The latter was given within the vulnerable period. Sargant J held that the prior agreement, although duly registered, could not save the subsequent security, as the subsequent formal charge was to complete an execution or performance of the prior agreement as to leave no right or obligation still subsisting under it (at p.211). The effect of the instrument, as Cozens-Hardy M.R. said in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Columbian Fireproofing</span> [1910] 2 Ch. 120 at 123, is that "the formal instrument necessarily supersedes and gives the go-by to the prior agreement”.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After the failure of the First Deed to create a valid charge, the position was that the Company was subject to an unperformed contractual obligation to create a valid floating charge. I think it is clear that the failed creation of the first deed did not discharge that obligation - where a person contracts do something, and attempts unsuccessfully to do it, it is clearly not the case that the failed attempt at performance discharges the contractual obligation to perform. The Company here, having contracted to give a valid floating charge and failed to do so, was under a continuing obligation to perform that obligation. That obligation did not itself create a charge, since it was  “merely an agreement that in some future circumstances a security shall in the future be created” (<span style="font-style:italic">Jackson &amp; Bassford Ltd </span>[1906] 2 Ch 467). However, the only way in which the parties could perform their contractual obligations was to agree a new date on which to grant a new charge, since there was nothing that the parties could do to validate the original charge (the date for registration having passed).</p>

On that date a new charge was to be granted, a new deed was to be executed, the new charge was to merge into that new deed, and that new deed was to take effect as from that agreed date. I also think that it is clear that to the extent that the agreement to do this constituted a mutually agreed variation of the terms of the SPA, acts done in performance of it were enforceable contractual obligations. Consequently the agreement by the Company to grant a new charge on the specified date gave rise to a new contractually enforceable charge, which took effect on that specified date. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Joint Administrators suggest that the legal basis for the Charge is not in fact the contract to grant the charge, but the failed charge itself. In this regard they rely on <span style="font-style:italic">Re Fireproof Doors Ltd </span>[1916] 2 Ch 142, at pp.150-151, per Astbury J (followed in <span style="font-style:italic">Rushingdale Ltd SA v Byblos Bank SAL</span> (1986) 2 BCC 99509, at 99516-99518) as authority for the proposition that where, as here, a company purports to execute a charge as a deed, but that deed is defective in its execution, then the failed deed may itself take effect as a present agreement to grant an equitable charge. I think they are correct to the extent that, if there were no prior contract, a case for the existence of the charge could be founded on the failed deed, and if it were, it would necessarily follow that such a charge was created at the time when the deed was purportedly delivered. However, I perceive this line of argument as additional to, rather than exclusive of, the argument that the charge arose out of the contractual agreement to grant it.  I think that if the Second Respondent wishes to argue, as he does, that the Charge was granted on the day on which the contract concerned provided that it should be granted, the fact that he could alternatively rely on the failed deed as giving rise to the charge does not defeat his argument. Another way of putting this point is to say that although the failed attempt to create a debenture clearly evidences the Charge, the Charge itself arose from the contractual obligation to create it.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The ordinary problem with such a charge continuing in existence would be that it would require registration.

This potentially raises the question of whether the submission of a registration in respect of the failed deed could constitute a registration of the contractual charge so as to render it valid.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One way to argue this would be to say that because the registrar’s certificate has been granted, the Charge can no longer be questioned, as laid down in s. s.859I(6) of the Companies Act 2006, (see <span style="font-style:italic">In Re C. L. Nye Ltd</span>, [1971] 1 Ch. 442 (CA) – a case decided under the old law but, it seems, still generally regarded as valid). However, there are limits to the unchallengeability of a certificate, and in particular a registration could not render valid an invalidly created charge, even under the old law - as Dillon J said in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Registrar of Companies, Ex Parte Central Bank Of India</span> [1986] 1 Q.B. 1114, the granting of a registrar’s certificate in respect of a charge “has no effect on the true construction of the charge, and does not preclude it being challenged on any other ground e.g. fraud or duress” (at 1183). It is therefore clear that the registration of the Third Deed was not effective to validate it as such. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The remaining question is as to whether the purported registration of the deed could have had the effect of validating the Charge. Since the Charge was intended to be identical to that to be created by the Third Deed, the majority of the registration statement would have been identical, and the substantive material required by s.859D would have been present.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The registration of one charge cannot validate an entirely different charge. As was correctly stated in the Australian case of <span style="font-style:italic">JJ Leonard Properties Pty Ltd v Leonard (WA) Pty Ltd (n Liquidation) </span>(1987) 13 ACLR 77, a registrar’s certificate is not any evidence that the requirements as to the registration of an equitable charge to which the notice of charge did not relate had been complied with. However, the Charge and the Third Deed were not entirely different – indeed, they were intended to be created as part of a single design, and to merge into each other. In this circumstance I think that the registration statement submitted to the registrar correctly described the legal effect and consequence of the Charge, and the registrar’s certificate should be held to cover the Charge. I think that this is equally true whether the Charge is taken to have arisen from the contractual obligation or from the failed attempt to embody it in a deed – in both cases, the result was the creation of a charge which was different in some respects from that described in the particulars of registration,  but in both cases the description of the charge filed with the registrar was an exact description of the charge which the chargor had granted, except for its legal form.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In this case it is necessary to determine the point, but I do not think that is its one of very great difficulty. If a company were to agree to grant a charge in exchange for funding, the contractual consideration would be the exchange of contractual promises. The performance of that obligation by the payment of money would not constitute “consideration” in the contractual sense, since the mere performance of an existing contractual obligation cannot itself constitute consideration in the contractual sense. However, it seems clear from the existing cases on s.245 that they regard “consideration” as meaning the actual lending of money, not the mere promise to do so. It is equally clear that if a financing proceeds in three stages; first the making of an agreement to provide finance and to grant a charge, second the granting of the charge, and third the payment over of the promised financing, the requirements of s.245 would be satisfied even though neither the making of the payment nor the granting of the charge would, in contractual terms, constitute “consideration”. </p>

The requirement here must therefore be to look at the point at which valuable property or services were in fact transferred.  That was clearly the date of completion of the transfer of the shares – that is, the 22 January.</p>

This follows from the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Shoe Lace Ltd</span> (sub. nom. <span style="font-style:italic">Power v Sharp</span>,  [1993] BCC 609). In that case the Court held that the decisions in a series of previous cases were wrong, in that they had been based on the incorrect proposition that payment made on account of the consideration for a charge, in anticipation of its creation and in reliance on a promise to execute it, would satisfy the requirements of the section. This was held to be  incorrect on the basis that the requirements of consideration and contemporaneity were in fact separate. Thus a charge can be struck down under s.245 on two entirely separate grounds; one being that value is transferred to the grantor prior to the creation of the charge, and the other being that the value transferred was not transferred in consideration for the grant of the charge.</p>

Their argument is that the shares were transferred pursuant to the SPA in exchange for the issue of the loan notes, and that the obligation to transfer the shares was entered into when the SPA was entered into. They therefore say that the shares cannot have been transferred “by reason of” the creation of a debenture created some time after the assumption of that obligation</p>

That agreement provided for both of those acts to be done on the date on which the agreement was signed. Neither of those things were in fact done on that date. Consequently both parties found themselves, some time later, in a position where neither had performed their contractual obligations as set out in the SPA. I think it is clear that they dealt with this by entering into another agreement by which both of these obligations were to be discharged on the 22 January. I think it is this agreement which supports the argument that the transfer was by reason of the charge.</p>

However, at the same time the Company was obliged to create a charge, had not done so, and could in equity have been compelled to do so. It is highly implausible that any order could have been secured to mandate one without mandating the other. To my mind this emphasises the fact that the performance of each obligation was in fact dependent on the performance of the other. </p>

Sealy &amp; Milman: Annotated Guide to the Insolvency Legislation (25th Ed. – 2022), Volume 1:  observe that “Whether paras (a) and (b) will themselves be open to a restrictive interpretation is unclear: it is hard to see why other forms of valuable consideration (e.g. the transfer of land or shares) were not included within the reform that was made”. However, the plain language of the provision refers only to “money” “goods” and “services”. Shares are not naturally described as “goods”. This is the point made by Armour and Bennett, Vulnerable Transactions in Corporate Insolvency (2003), at 5.5913: </p>

Thus, consideration for a floating charge in the form of rights over, for example, land, intellectual property or choses in action would be regarded as of no value under the legislation. While it is hard to justify this discrimination, it appears unavoidable as a matter of statutory interpretation.” </p>

This extension in the concept of new value represents a compromise between the views of the hardliners who considered that the old restriction to cash should be retained and the proponents of the opposing view that any form of money’s worth should suffice. The Cork committee rather cautiously recommended the addition of goods to cash but the exclusion of services [Insolvency Law and Practice, Report of the Review Committee, Cmnd. 8558, para 1564]. In the end, services were added to the list. The result in broad terms is that admissible new value is restricted to those forms of benefit to the company which arise from day-to-day trading and finance and have a readily ascertainable value. Excluded are a wide range of other assets, both tangible and intangible, including land and buildings, intellectual property rights, debts and other receivables and rights under contracts.” </p>

In a case such as this, where property has been sold to a company, the Company has agreed to pay a price for that property, the seller has agreed to the Company deferring its obligation to pay the price, and the resulting debt is secured by a floating charge, it is in my view impossible to produce any rational justification for saying that this rule should apply to the sale of some types of property but not others. There is of course a concern about the value of the property concerned, but this is fully addressed by s.245(6), which requires any such property to be valued on an arms-length basis.</p>

My starting-point here is that the facts in <span style="font-style:italic">Peak Hotels</span> involved a situation where experts were wildly at variance with each other as to the value of the services delivered. The challenge here, by contrast, seems to be to ascertain whether the correct valuation of a company whose asset is a cash balance of USD $2.3m is in fact $2.3m. However, the Joint Administrators point out that the position is not quite this straightforward. One of the reasons for structuring the transaction in the way in which it was in fact structured was to enable Mr Farah to maintain a degree of control over the cash balance of DMCC. The Joint Administrators point out – fairly – that the value of a limited right to control a cash balance may well be considerably less than the value of that cash balance. </p>

As far as the documentation was concerned, there were no limits on the Company's ability to use the funds held by DMCC prior to the Deed of Amendment, and it was that deed which imposed such restrictions. However, the true position was that Mr Farah, who had de facto control of the DMCC bank account, declined to allow the funds therein to be used for anything other than trading transactions. The substance of the agreement which constituted the Renegotiation was that Mr Farah would release that constraint, and allow the funds held by DMCC to be applied for other group purposes, in exchange for (inter alia) the imposition of formal bondholder control over the expenditure of cash by the Company. Mr Farah, in effect, gave up his block on the DMCC account in exchange for control over the Company’s use of cash.</p>

The key to this is the test articulated by Parker J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Orleans Motor Company</span> – is the result of the arrangements an increase in the amount of assets available for creditors? It is clear that the provision of intangible services can have this effect. However, where the “service” provided is no more than a renegotiation of an existing arrangement, and there is no immediate material benefit to the Company from the renegotiation,  then there is no “consideration”. I note that this is the case even though the actions of the creditor unquestionably would constitute consideration in a contractual sense, but I think that is the intended and deliberate effect of the words of limitation used in the section. </p>

This demonstrates the significance and importance of the agreement eventually reached to the Company. However, it does not mean that entry into that agreement is capable of constituting consideration here. The point is not that the concessions made by Mr Farah in the Renegotiation were not valuable- they clearly were. The point is that they did not have the effect of swelling the assets of the company available to creditors by any measurable amount, and therefore cannot constitute consideration for the purposes of s.245. </p>

It provides that each noteholder shall receive a certificate executed as a deed by the Company specifying the amount of Notes which he holds. It is important that there is no provision of the CLNI which requires (or even contemplates) the issue of physical notes. The Notes are to have registered form, and the certificates are evidence of the fact that the relevant entries have been made on the register. Thus, for example, the definition of “Noteholder” in the CLNI is “the person for the time being entered in the Company’s register as holders or joint holders of the notes”. The Notes therefore exist in the same way that a share in a company exists – its existence can be proven, but it has no physical existence.</p>

Section 245(2)(b) is unconditional in its form – any discharge of any debt of the company constitutes consideration. However s. 245 and its predecessors have in this regard been given a heavily purposive interpretation by the courts.

An existing creditor would be able to avoid the consequences of s.245 by the simple expedient of requiring a notional repayment of the existing debt in return for a new advance of the same amount. To avoid this conclusion either the reference to discharge or reduction of debt must be construed as meaning debt owed to a person other than the creditor making the new advance, or the courts would need to regard the “repayment” and “new advance” as in substance effecting no change at all and therefore being outside the ambit of category (b).”</p>

Parker J. in <span style="font-style:italic">In re Orleans Motor Co. Ltd</span> [1911] 2 Ch 41, speaking of a statutory predecessor of s.245, s.212 of the Companies (Consolidation) Act, 1908, explained that "The section was designed apparently to prevent companies on their last legs from creating floating charges to secure past debts or for moneys which do not go to swell their assets and become available for creditors.".

L.R. 1758, the Court of Appeal had to consider the operation of section 245(2), IA 1986, and specifically the issue of the valuation of the provision of services for the purposes of section 245(2)(a). At [31], Henderson LJ explained that “it is important to begin by placing section 245 in its statutory context in the law of insolvency and examining how the section operates”. At [32], he explained that “section 245 is one of a group of sections which enable transactions entered into during a specified period before the onset of insolvency to be set aside or adjusted. Parliament has decided that these powers are needed in order to strike a fair balance between the creditors of a company which enters liquidation or administration”. At [33], he then expanded on this. </p>

              <p class="Quote">“The critical distinction between fixed and floating charges, at least in the present context, is that a fixed charge necessarily attaches from its inception to existing property of the company, whereas a floating charge remains in suspense until the happening of a crystallising event, whereupon it will attach to the company’s assets of the types specified in the charge as at the date of crystallisation, whether or not they were in existence when the floating charge was created. This has the potential to cause unfairness between the holder of a floating charge and the company’s unsecured creditors if the charge is created at a time when the company is of doubtful solvency and it later goes into liquidation or administration. In particular, the secured creditor would be likely to gain an unfair advantage if it were thus able to obtain priority for any part of the company’s indebtedness to it which in substance preceded the date of the charge, or which post-dated the charge but exceeded the further value actually provided by the creditor to the company before the charge crystallised. In general terms, that is the mischief which section 245 seeks to combat. It does so, like its predecessors in the Companies Acts of 1908 and 1948, by providing that a floating charge over the company’s property or undertaking, created during the specified “relevant period”, is invalid except to the extent specified in the section.

The evidence suggested that the matter was dealt with by book entries as between Labco and Lloyds, but the statement of account showed a debit entry against a cheque number and Nourse J inferred that Whyte did draw a cheque on the new Lloyds account in favour of Labco (see 315f-g). </p>

              <p class="Quote"> “I was referred to five earlier authorities in which the meaning of the expression 'cash paid to the company' was considered. They were <span style="font-style:italic">Re Orleans Motor Co Ltd </span>[1911] 2 Ch 41; <span style="font-style:italic">Re Hayman, Christy &amp; Lilly Ltd </span>[1917] 1 Ch 283; <span style="font-style:italic">Re Matthew Ellis Ltd</span> [1933] Ch 458, CA; Re Destone Fabrics Ltd [1941] Ch 319; and <span style="font-style:italic">Re Ambassadors (Bournemouth) Ltd</span> (1961) 105 Sol Jo 969. In some of those cases learned judges expressed general views as to the transactions which the section was intended to defeat. Thus, in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Orleans Motor Co Ltd</span> [1911] 2 Ch 41 at 45, Parker J said that one of the apparent objects of the provision was to prevent companies on their last legs from creating floating charges for moneys which do not go to swell their assets and become available for creditors. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re Hayman, Christy &amp; Lilly Ltd</span> [1917] 1 Ch 283 at 285, Astbury J thought that the expression meant 'except the amount of any cash absolutely and unconditionally paid to the company'. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re Matthew Ellis Ltd</span> [1933] Ch 458 at 464–5, Eve J at first instance disapproved the view of Astbury J, but then excluded from the expression any payments of cash made upon the condition that the cash should be applied in discharge of an existing, as opposed to a future, liability of the company. The Court of Appeal disapproved all the views above mentioned and held that a floating charge will not be invalidated merely by reason of the imposition of a condition that the money advanced is to be applied by the company in discharge of an existing liability, provided that the transaction is in substance for the benefit of the company and not merely the substitution of a secured for an unsecured debt and thus of benefit to one creditor at the expense of others. The question was expressed in much the same way by Simonds J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Destone Fabrics Ltd</span> [1941] Ch 319 at 324. He said that the ultimate test might well be whether the transaction is to be regarded as one intended bona fide for the benefit of the company, or whether it is intended merely to provide certain moneys for the benefit of certain of the company's creditors to the prejudice of others. Finally, I should record that in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Orleans Motor Co Ltd</span> [1911] 2 Ch 41 at 45, Parker J had said that another of the apparent objects of the section was to prevent companies on their last legs from creating floating charges to secure past debts. There has never, I think, been any doubt about that. Indeed, that part of Parker J's views was expressly approved by the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Re Matthew Ellis Ltd</span> [1933] Ch 458 which remains the most authoritative decision on the subject. Accordingly, the primary question in each case is whether the transaction is in substance for the benefit of the company and not merely the substitution of a secured for an unsecured debt.</p>

              <p class="Quote">In <span style="font-style:italic">Re Matthew Ellis Ltd</span> [1933] Ch 458 it was held that the charge was valid. In each of the other four cases it was held that the charge was invalid. And each of them appears to me to have been a case where it could be said that there had been a blatant attempt to obtain a benefit for one creditor at the expense of others. In other words, there had been underhand conduct of one kind or another. In my judgment, however, conduct of that kind is not a pre-requisite to the operation of the section. In the present case it is not suggested that there was any such conduct on the part of Lloyds in procuring the execution by Whyte of the floating charge of 2 April 1974. For myself, I would like to say that any such suggestion would have been manifestly unsustainable. Nevertheless, the primary submission made by counsel for the liquidator (Mr Scott) was that, to the extent of the first £12·75m, the floating charge was in substance created to secure Whyte's past indebtedness to Lloyds. On that simple ground, submitted counsel for the liquidator (Mr Scott), the charge was to that extent invalid.”</p>

Here, within the relevant time period, the director had, in anticipation of being granted a floating charge over the company, advanced £10,000 to the company. Under the law at the time, this was held to be a payment at the time of the floating charge (pp.930H-932B). After the floating charge was executed, the director then advanced two further payments of £10,00 each. These were paid directly into the Company’s overdrawn bank account; the director was a guarantor of the company’s indebtedness to the bank, and so the payments pro tanto reduced the director’s liability to the bank.</p>

It was held by Mummery J.  that these payments “were not paid to the company within sec. 245(2)(a) because they never became available to the company to use as it liked” (933 C). The reason for this was that the payments were in fact made by the director to the company’s bank on terms that his liability under his guarantee of the company’s indebtedness to that bank would be reduced pro tanto. At no point did the company ever have any control over the funds, or any say in their use. He distinguished the case of <span style="font-style:italic">In Re Matthew Ellis</span>, whose facts were very similar, on the basis that in that case the payment was for the benefit of a supplier, and was “a business transaction which secured [for the company] the goodwill of a firm which was willing to continue to supply goods to the company on credit and so keep the business of the company going” (at p.993).</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It seems to me that where a creditor of a company agrees to reduce or extinguish a money claim on that company as part of a transaction whose consequences are that it will acquire a new claim on that company of roughly equal value, that reduction or extinguishment will not constitute consideration for the purposes of s.245. I agree with Mummery J that in such a transaction, no new resources ever become available to the company. I therefore think that, on the authorities as they stand, any exchange transaction where a company’s liabilities on existing debt are extinguished, but only on condition that the company becomes liable for a new debt to the same creditor will fail this test. It should be noted here that the problem is not the exchange, it is the automaticity. If a noteholder sold debt instruments issued by a company back to that company, and then reinvested the proceed of sale in new notes issued by the same company, this problem would not arise. The issue arises where the terms of the transaction place the company in a position where incurring the new debt is the necessary price of being released from the old debt. That is exactly the position in this case.</p>

In this context, reliance was placed on two cases. In <span style="font-style:italic">Re Matthew Ellis, Ltd</span> [1933] Ch. 458, at 477, Romer LJ said that:</p>

              <p class="Quote"> “There are, of course, certain considerations for the issue of a debenture which plainly do not amount to payments in cash. Where, for instance, an existing creditor of a company takes a debenture from the company to secure the amount of his debt on the terms that he shall not immediately press for payment of his debt, or where he takes a debenture for the amount of his debt on the terms that the debt itself is to be extinguished, obviously no cash passes from the debenture holder to the company. If in such a case he goes through the form of drawing a cheque in favour of the company for the amount of his debt on the terms that the company shall forthwith itself hand to him in exchange a cheque for the same amount, there has in form been a payment in cash. But in such a case there has not been a payment in cash if one looks at the substance and not at the form, and in considering whether there has been a payment of cash within the meaning of s. 266  it is always the question of substance that must be regarded and not the question of form.”</p>

The present case is an example of the position where there is no subterfuge, no dishonesty, and where it seems to me that all parties acted honestly and with probity. The striking down of a floating charge under this section does not carry any implication of wrongfulness - as Nourse J said in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Re Whyte</span> (at p. 317b), the presence of such conduct is not a statutory prerequisite for the operation of those provisions. Equally, I strongly disagree that a debt restructuring transaction of the kind before me is anything other than a perfectly normal commercial transaction. One of the distinguishing features of s.245 is that it can operate in situations where all those concerned were acting in a way which they believed to be transparent and honest, and that appears to be exactly the case here.</p>

As to that, like her, I do not understand that section 245(2)(b) has altered the general purposes of section 245, which is to prevent a company that is on its last legs from creating a floating charge to secure past debts or to secure moneys which do not go to swell its assets and become available for creditors.” </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view, it did not. The starting point is to return – once again – to the idea that consideration in this regard is that which swells the assets of the company concerned and becomes available for creditors. On an insolvency of the Company, it seems likely that Mr Farah’s power to restrict the utilisation of the account would in effect have terminated – if DMCC were placed in the local equivalent of a members voluntary liquidation, it is difficult to see how the relevant cash balances would not have been made available to the local liquidator, and then to the creditors of the Company.  Consequently I think that at all material times after the Company acquired DMCC, the assets of DMCC would have been available to creditors of the Company in a winding-up. Consequently, I do not believe that Mr Farah’s agreement to partially remove his veto over their deployment had the effect of increasing the assets of the Company, and for that reason I do not believe that it constituted consideration under s.245.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, I should say a word about the process by which this judgment came to be delivered. I am asked by the Joint Administrators to give directions on three points. The answers to the second and third points depend to some extent on the direction given in respect of the first. In the oral hearing before me, the focus of the submissions of the parties was almost exclusively on the second and third points. In considering the matter further in the course of writing my first draft judgment, I concluded that the first point was more difficult than I had thought. I set out in the draft judgment that I circulated my preliminary conclusions on it. However, the parties, upon receipt of that draft, represented (correctly) that if the point was as important as I considered it to be, they should be able to make further representations in respect of it. I decided that the appropriate course would be to permit further submissions to be made, and have now received those submissions from all parties. This judgment is therefore substantially different from the draft originally circulated.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fact that my judgment was circulated as a draft judgment means that, as a procedural matter,  I have a discretion whether or not to receive further submissions and to reconsider it. However that discretion cannot be, and should not be, exercised capriciously. More importantly, if a Judge has simply got things wrong, it is not for him to conduct an appeal against his own judgment (<span style="font-style:italic">In re St Nazaire Company</span> (1879) 12 Ch D 88). I have therefore considered carefully the extent to which it is permissible for me to substantially revise my initial draft in the light of the further submissions received.</p>

A relevant factor must be whether any party has acted upon the decision to his detriment, especially in a case where it is expected that they may do so before the order is formally drawn up. On the other hand, in <span style="font-style:italic">re Blenheim Leisure (Restaurants) Ltd</span>, Neuberger J gave some examples of cases where it might be just to revisit the earlier decision. But these are only examples. A carefully considered change of mind can be sufficient. Every case is going to depend upon its particular circumstances.”</p>

He gave as examples the situations where the judge had not given adequate reasons for some aspect of the judgment, or where the judge had decided the case on a point that was not properly argued, or relied on an authority which was not considered.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel for the Applicant and the First Respondent have submitted that my draft judgment fell within the second of these. In particular, they argue that the points raised by the Second Respondent as regards the validity of the charge were raised for the first time at the hearing, so that counsel for the Applicants and the First Respondent were not able to respond properly and fully to them. Counsel for the Second Respondent argues that these points were not new, were acknowledged in the other parties submissions, and were in any event covered by his skeleton argument, which was circulated a week before trial. Consequently, he says, if those points were not addressed by the other parties in their submissions, that is their funeral, and they should not now be permitted to come back for another bite at the cherry.</p>

The issue before the court is, in my view, a matter of some general importance,  and I think it is only appropriate to ensure that it has been fully and properly argued before giving judgment. It is not suggested that these issues were fully argued before me, and the further submissions from counsel for the Joint Administrators consist of 21 pages of closely-reasoned analysis. I have derived a great deal of benefit from them, as well as from the further submissions of all the other parties</p>

However, it seems to me that since the outcome will be a judgment which has had the benefit of full submissions on all of the material points, it is the approach which best serves the interests of justice.</p>
