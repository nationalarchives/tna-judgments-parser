The documents were not tailored to any<br />material extent to suit the individual circumstances of the different parties. Evidence provided to the Tribunal showed multiple identical loan agreements and contracts of employement, varying only in personal details and monetary sums. Whilst it may be common for employers to have standardised agreements, given that for example the Bank of England base rate, and the official beneficial loan rate varied over the period, it might be expected that there would be some variation in loan arrangements to reflect this. </p>

It appears from the evidence in the bundle that it was not clear to end users that there was an offshore company in the employment arrangements.  The emails sending links to the documents were sent by HBL and reference what HBL would do, for example ‘during working hours we process your invoices the same day we receive them’.</p>

As HBL was paid for its part in these arrangements, I conclude that HBL had a business which involved the provision to other persons of services relating to taxation, and hence this was  relevant business.</p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">HBL also appears to be significantly involved in the organisation or management of the arrangements, as HBL invoiced UK agencies on behalf of users, received payments from UK agencies on behalf of users, issued full VAT invoices to HBC in relation to the amounts HBL owed HBC (which it was required to settle by paying HBC in return for the services users<br />provided to end users in their capacity as HBC employees) and transferred the above funds to HBC. Without HBL’s involvement the income received would not reach HBC and be paid to the end users. The issuing of invoices to agencies is therefore crucial to the arrangements, and therefore HBL is involved in a critical part of the organisation of the arrangements.</p>
