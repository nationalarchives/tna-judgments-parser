They followed him on bicycles.  He approached a parked car and got into the front passenger seat.  The applicant was the driver.  The officers suspected that a drug deal was about to be carried out between the two men and so they decided to detain and search them, along with the vehicle, under section 23 of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:0.5in">The defence applied under section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 to exclude all references to drugs and drug dealing as being the reason for the attempt to stop the applicant on the basis that the prejudicial effect of this evidence would outweigh any probative value it might have.  The prosecution submitted that the officers' suspicion was important explanatory evidence for the jury properly to understand the case, and that it supported the prosecution's contention as to why the applicant might not have wished to comply with the instruction to stop his car and drove off in a dangerous manner.  The prosecution accepted that a direction should be given that there was no evidence that the applicant was dealing in drugs.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:0.5in">In her ruling, the Recorder rejected the application by the defence.  She set out the relevant principles she had to apply.  She decided that the officers' suspicions and the reasons for them were important explanatory evidence for the jury. Without hearing evidence from the officers about their reasons for attempting to stop the vehicle, the jury would not properly be able to understand the case.  In particular, the prosecution would effectively be prevented from putting a positive case about the reasons why the applicant may have driven in the way alleged and the police officers would be prevented from explaining to the jury why they acted in the way they did, which could lead to the jury being given a misleading impression of the evidence of those officers.   defence would be able to cross-examine the officers.  In his police interview the applicant had provided an explanation for the meeting that had taken place.  The jury would need to be directed that the applicant faced a charge of dangerous driving and not drugs offences.  Any perceived or actual prejudice to the applicant could be overcome by a direction.  The evidence would not have such an adverse effect on the fairness of proceedings that it ought not to be admitted.</p>

As he approached the vehicle on his bicycle he shouted "Police – stop!" He approached the driver's side and stopped.  He was astride his bicycle with his feet on the ground.  Suddenly the car came towards him and his bicycle was "almost being sucked under the car".  It all happened very quickly and he had to use his hands on the car to push himself away from it as his bicycle went under the wheel.  He shouted "Police – stop!" a number of times, and his colleagues also shouted.  The driver sped off.  The officer's bicycle was dragged underneath the car, until it was dislodged at the next junction.</p>

He followed the car when it went off  quickly, dragging PC Murphy's bicycle underneath.  He saw the passenger exit the vehicle while it was moving and tumble into the road.  The officer relayed the registration number by radio.  He caught up with the car when it was held up in traffic and he tried to open the driver's door to detain the driver.  Again, he said "Police – stop!", but the driver managed to drive off.  </p>

The driver of the car turned the wheel towards PC Murphy and then drove off at speed.  The witness believed that PC Murphy would have gone under the vehicle if he had not managed to push himself clear.  The vehicle was going very fast and the bicycle was dragged under it for about 50 metres.  He followed the vehicle while he could and it was his belief that the passenger was pushed out when it was moving, because he ended up on the road head first.</p>

He gave an account that he was on his way to meet a friend because he wanted to buy some perfumes from him for Mother's Day.  His friend got into the car.  He seemed worried and told him to drive off straight away.  As he did so, he saw men running towards the car.  He did not know that they were police officers.  They were not in uniform and they did not say that they were the police.  It seemed very aggressive.  He thought he was under attack and so he drove away.  Something got stuck under his car.  He denied driving dangerously or at speed.  Further on, his friend asked to be let out, so he slowed down for him to get out of the car. </p>

He did not drive at the officer or deliberately run over his bicycle, and he did not speed off.  The officer tried to obstruct his vehicle by pushing his bicycle in front of it.

            <p style="text-indent:0.5in">We are grateful to Mr Seller for his clear and succinct submissions this morning.  He submits that the evidence about the suspicion of drug dealing and the making of a drugs search had a grossly prejudicial effect on the applicant's case and added nothing to the prosecution case.  The evidence implied that the passenger had gone to the car to buy drugs and that the applicant was a dealer attempting to evade the police.  The jury should not have been told that the police were intending to conduct a drugs search.  The prosecution case could have been put simply on the basis that the police were investigating crime in the area.  The prejudicial effect could not be cured by judicial direction.  The evidence should not have gone before the jury.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:0.5in">In a Respondent's Notice the prosecution submits that the reason for the factual suspicion was important explanatory evidence to assist in the jury's understanding of the case.  It also lent support to the prosecution case as to why the applicant might have decided not to comply with the officers' instruction to stop and instead decided to drive dangerously in order to get away from the police.  It is submitted that the Recorder exercised her discretion correctly.</p>

            <p style="text-indent:0.5in">In our judgment there is no merit in the proposed ground of appeal.  It is unarguable that the conviction is unsafe.  First, the defence were correct not to suggest that the evidence to which they objected was irrelevant.  Second, it was not suggested that that evidence engaged the bad character code in the Criminal Justice Act 2003.  The evidence was material and had to do with the alleged facts of the offence charged (see section 98(a)).  Third, the sole basis upon which the Recorder was asked to exclude the evidence was section 78 of the 1984 Act.  Fourth, there is no suggestion that the Recorder misdirected herself as to the correct principles to be applied.  She set out her reasoning clearly and carefully.  In reality, the applicant's criticism goes solely to the exercise of the Recorder's discretion.  We see no basis upon which that judgment could, arguably, be impugned.  Fifth, in her directions to the jury, the Recorder told them, in effect, that the applicant was accused of, and being tried solely for, dangerous driving, and not any drugs offence.</p>
