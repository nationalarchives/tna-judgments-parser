Even if the resources were available, it would be wasteful to have such an investigation, involving much the same evidence, in every case. There would also be a risk of inconsistent decisions, a consideration that is particularly important as it follows from a decision that if one person requires protection, if correct, that a person in the same situation who has been returned may have risked or suffered ill treatment or worse.

The coalition came to power at the conclusion of the 1974 to 1991 civil war and dominated Ethiopian politics until 2019 when it dissolved. The present Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, acknowledged to Parliamentarians in June 2018 that the EPRDF engaged in the systematic use of torture against members and perceived members of the opposition prior to his accession in April 2018: “Our constitution doesn’t allow it, but we have been torturing, causing bodily damages and even putting inmates in dark prison cells ... These were terrorist acts committed by us and using force just to stay in power is a terrorist act too.” </span></p>

In October 2016 the then Prime Minister, Hailemariam Desalegn, declared a nationwide state of emergency and by February 2017 the government acknowledged that 20,000 people had been arrested under emergency powers in Oromia Region.

With the TPLF having descended into factionalism, for the first time since its creation the leadership of the EPRLF was handed to a non-Tigrayan, Abiy Ahmed, the then 42-year-old Oromo leader of the OPDO. Following his accession as Prime Minister in April 2018, Prime Minister Abiy tightened his grip on the party with the removal of several central committee members. The ODPO was renamed the Oromo Democratic Party (ODP) in September 2018. The EPRDF coalition was subsequently annulled, and its successor the pan-ethnic Prosperity Party was established on 1 December 2019. The new party was formed through the merger of three of the four governing coalition parties, including the ODP, with five regional allies also agreeing to be merged.

Though the coup attempt took place in Amhara Region, the political ramifications spread across Ethiopia with the political space that had been opened between the government and opposition beginning at this time to close, as the government openly took steps to repress the opposition, media, and dissent.</span></p>

Hachalu Hundessa was a popular Oromo singer who at the age of 17 had been imprisoned for 5 years in 2003 for participating in protests. Following the release of his first album he emerged as a powerful political voice and his songs were the soundtrack to the wave of anti-government protests that led to the downfall of Prime Minister Hailemariam in 2018. Hachalu Hundessa was shot dead on 29 June 2020 in Addis Ababa and over the following days more than 100 people were killed in protests held in the capital and in Oromia Region. In response to the protests the Ethiopian government renewed restrictions on individual rights, and its use of repressive tools in the ensuing crackdown, including arbitrarily arresting its citizens and shutting down the internet, echoed tactics employed by the previous EPRDF government. A later investigation undertaken by the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission identified over 9,000 arrests arising from the disturbances.</span></p>

During the last quarter of the 19th century, the Amhara-dominated Ethiopian Empire expanded to the south, tripling its territory. During such time much of what is now Oromia Region was conquered and forcibly incorporated into the Empire. Oromo suffered exclusion, with land expropriated and institutions suppressed. There were regular efforts to forcibly assimilate Oromo and the use of the indigenous language, Afaan Oromoo, was banned in Ethiopia, including in political life and schools, from 1941 until 1991, as part of an assimilationist policy that identified the speaking of Amharic as being ‘Ethiopian’. Many nationalist Oromo identify a long, difficult and often antagonistic relationship with the Ethiopian State, with their level of political and economic influence being incommensurate to their numerical size.</span></p>

In 1991, the OLF joined the TPLF-led transitional government, but its leadership became convinced that it would not be allowed to compete fairly against the OPDO in the 1992 elections. Relations with the EPRDF degenerated into open conflict and OLF ministers serving in the transitional government withdrew and left the country. Soon afterwards EPRDF military forces captured thousands of OLF fighters and drove the OLF out of the country. The party’s leadership was subsequently divided between Eritrea, Europe and the United States which led to repeated splintering and the establishment of rival parties.</span></p>

First and foremost, the party did not contest the federal and regional elections in 2021, thereby denying the electorate the opportunity to cast votes for the senior Oromo nationalist party. Further, the pressure contributed to the enlarging of existing divisions within the party. The OLF has long been a fractured organisation, not only in respect of its relations with its former armed wing, but also consequent to strong disagreements within the party as to how it should move forward, coupled with significant personality differences. Against the backdrop of an upsurge in arrests and detention of its members, the fractured nature of the OLF’s leadership led to a significant dispute arising between Dawud Ibsa and deputy chairman Ararso Biqila resulting in both asserting that they run the party.  </span></p>

From 1992 onwards the exiled OLF waged an armed struggle in Ethiopia through the OLA by means of guerrilla warfare. To many observers such military actions were largely ineffectual and provided no serious military threat to the Ethiopian government. However, the OLA’s military actions led to the Ethiopian authorities designating the OLF as a terrorist organisation in June 2011.</span></p>

Integration and disarmament proved in many cases to be unsuccessful. The OLA remained its own security force, with its own leadership and strongholds. Years of unrest weakened regional government control in areas of Oromia Region such as Welega and Guji. Upon the return of the OLF and OLA to Ethiopia in 2018, returnees stepped into the security vacuum in these areas, sometimes working with the police to enforce order. However, there were accusations that the regional government had reneged upon promises to employ OLA fighters as police officers and were singling them out for arrest and beatings. In turn, the regional government accused the OLA of keeping their weapons. By late 2018, members of the OLA had returned to the forests and were killing officials and attacking army convoys. In 2019 the federal government reported that the national air force was bombing OLA training camps.</span></p>

The OLA denies its involvement in such attacks. The authorities also accuse the OLA of engaging in assassination, with targeted killings of numerous local administrators. There have also been regular reports of deaths consequent to OLA ambushes. The decision to attack government officials and police officers in small towns and villages forms part of a strategy to make areas of Oromia Region ungovernable for the federal and regional governments. The OLA has claimed responsibility for some deaths on social media, though it has also engaged in correspondence with the Addis Standard magazine addressing allegations made against it and declaring that “our troops face stiff penalties for killing civilians; there is no tolerance for such acts.” </span></p>

In November 2019, the OLF registered with the election board (NEBE) as a political organisation, agreeing to work with other political parties in Oromia state. In January 2020, the OLF signed an agreement with the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC) and Oromo Nationalist Party (ONP) to form a coalition in the forthcoming elections (at the time of writing postponed indefinitely). However, some sources indicate that the OLF (and the OLA) may not be a single entity, but has fractured into a number of sub-groups and in some areas is not controlled by a single person or entity. OLF sources told the Home Office in September 2019 that they operated in Addis Ababa and the surrounding area and had opened 40 offices in 2019 across the country, although 30 subsequently closed.’</span></p>

At that time the chairman of the OLF, Dawud Ibsa, had been subjected to house arrest; several leading members of the party had been arrested, detained and in some cases held for several months without charge; and several thousand people had been arrested in June and July 2020 following violent disturbances in Oromia Region and Addis Ababa, many of whom were - or were suspected to be - members and supporters of the OLF. Many thousands were to remain in detention for long periods of time in poor detention conditions or were subjected to cyclical arrest, release and re-arrest. Re-education was conducted upon detainees held in military camps. Further, the OLF was subject to significant obstruction in respect of opening and running party offices, including the occupation of its office in Addis Ababa by police officers on 1 August 2020 and the resulting bar upon party officials and members from entering the premises.

No elaboration is given as to the meaning of ‘significant history’, but we note that the Tribunal accepted the evidence set out in a Country Information and Policy Unit (CIPU) report of April 2004 as to the arbitrary detention and ill-treatment of ‘thousands of OLF members and sympathisers’. In 2007, the evidential finding</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#FF0000"> </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">HA</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'"> was converted into formal guidance by the Tribunal in </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua'">MB (OLF and MTA – risk)</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua'">.

Others were kept in arbitrary detention for prolonged periods, often without hearing or cause shown, sometimes incommunicado. The Tribunal also considered a range of evidence identifying the use of torture by the authorities. We note that this accords with Prime Minister Abiy’s subsequent admission to Parliament that the EPRDF engaged, for many years, in the systemic use of torture against perceived opponents. This was the context in which the previous Tribunal, whose guidance we are invited to uphold, employed the term.</span></p>

These civilians are then subject to the same cycle of arrest/release/re-arrest as that identified by Dr Love over 15 years ago.

We note Mr. Southerden’s evidence on behalf of Amnesty International, consistent with other evidence placed before us, that “both formal arrest warrants and institutional as well as personal memory of individual officers plays a major role in determining who is perceived as possessing an anti-government agenda and therefore subject to suspicion.” This local, and informal, approach is the context in which we must place the numbers of those arrested. We therefore conclude that ‘significant’ should not be read as necessarily denoting a very high level of involvement or support. Rather, it relates to suspicion being established that a person is perceived by the authorities as possessing an anti-government agenda. This is a fact sensitive assessment. </span></p>

      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Re: [Appellant], Ethiopia &amp; Country Guidance on Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) Supporters and Activists.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">We write regarding your above-named client, who we understand has sought international protection in the UK. We understand that this application has been refused by the Secretary of State and on appeal at the First Tier Tribunal. We further understand that this case has now progressed to the Upper Tribunal where it is being considered for use as a vehicle for a new country guidance case on the issues last determined in the case of MB (OLF and MTA – risk) Ethiopia CG [2007] UKAIT 00030 (hereafter referred to as MB). We understand that it is the Secretary of State’s position, accepted by the First Tier Tribunal Judge, that there has been [sic] there are very strong grounds, supported by cogent evidence of a change in circumstances in Ethiopia, to justify a departure from the findings in MB. A panel of the UT will be considering whether the current country guidance in MB should continue to apply.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">You have asked for [sic] Amnesty International if we are able to respond to the following questions regarding your client’s case, in light of our organisation’s ongoing research and experience of human rights conditions in Ethiopia:</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Question 1: Do Oromo Liberation Front members and sympathisers (whether perceived or otherwise) continue to be at real risk of persecution in Ethiopia?</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Question 2: To what extent does the above depend on profile; (with reference to the appellant’s case for instance)?</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Question 3: Are you able to comment on the assertion by the Home Office at 2.4.26 of their July CPIN on Ethiopia that there are very strong grounds supported by cogent evidence to depart from the Upper Tribunal findings in the current country guidance case of MB (OLF and MTA – risk) Ethiopia CG [2007] UKAIT 00030 (29 March 2007) set out at 2.4.21 - 22 of the current CPIN on opposition to the Government?</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Question 4: The present position of members and supporters of the OLF vis-a-vis government security forces?</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Question 5: Is there today likely to be a presumption by the state that an Oromo person on return to Ethiopia is a member of, affiliated to or associated with the OLF?</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Our answers to these questions should be read alongside our publicly published information on Ethiopia, all of which is available from the Ethiopia database on our website.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/search/?country=38595"><span class="Hyperlink">https://www.amnesty.org/en/search/?country=38595</span></a></p><p class="EndnoteText" /></authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> In particular, however, we would ask that this letter be read alongside our recent in-depth report, ‘Beyond Law Enforcement: Human Rights Violations By Ethiopian Security Forces In Amhara And Oromia’, a copy of which we have provided as an annex to this letter.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Our answers to these questions have been prepared by Amnesty International UK’s Refugee and Migrant Rights Programme in conjunction with the individual Ethiopia research team based at AI’s International Secretariat. The Ethiopia research team consists of experienced research and campaigning staff who conduct continual research in the field and from AI’s regional hub office in Nairobi, Kenya. They conduct field research to gather information and testimony, as well as maintaining regular contact with a range of sources in Ethiopia, which includes Ethiopian human rights organisations, UN bodies and international non-governmental sources. They also receive information from detainees and their families, lawyers, journalists, asylum-seekers and refugees, diplomats, humanitarian agencies, and government officials. They monitor newspapers, websites and other media outlets. All research is carried out in accordance with the goals of the organisation and the principles of independence and impartiality.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Over the last ten years our organisation has provided responses to queries of this kind in excess of 400 individual cases, across a wide range of nationalities and at various stages of the international protection process in the UK, including at first instance, before the First-Tier and Upper Tribunal, the High Court, the Court of Appeal and in proceedings in the European Court of Human Rights. We can confirm that no financial income is derived from preparing letters of this kind regarding international protection cases.</span></p>

      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Having read these documents and emails to us, we understand that [the appellant] is a young man and an Ethiopian national of Oromo ethnicity. He states that he is the son of a farmer and OLF supporter. He states that in 2013 (when [the appellant] would have been aged around 13) police raided his family home on several occasions looking for his father, and that his father was eventually arrested in February 2014 due to his involvement with the OLF. He states that his father was held in Dallomana prison until Jan 2016 when he was taken to hospital, weak from beatings and torture. [The appellant] states that in 2015 a fellow pupil brought an OLF flag to his school and distributed it and displayed it amongst the pupils. The police arrived, rounded the students up and questioned them. [The appellant] states he was beaten and arrested and then held in Dallomana prison for 10 days before being made to sign a promise not to be involved with the OLF again and threatened he would be killed if he did so. He states that despite this he began secretly attending OLF meetings, distributing leaflets and in February 2016 took part in an OLF demonstration against police misconduct in the region. He states that he was arrested again and detained, this time for 28 days during which time he states he was beaten and questioned about his activities. He states he was released after payment of a bribe, by his uncle, and that it was then arranged for him to travel on the overland route out of the country.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Background – Human Rights in Ethiopia</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">This section refers to information published in our recent public report, ‘Beyond Law Enforcement: Human Rights Violations By Ethiopian Security Forces In Amhara and Oromia’, and should be read alongside that report.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Ethiopia has been ruled since 1991 by the Ethiopian People’s Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF); a coalition of ethnically-based parties representative of the main regions in Ethiopia’s ethnic-federal constitutional system, dominated by the Tigray People’s Liberation Front (TPLF). The EPRDF pursued a highly autocratic and repressive governing strategy, criminalising and in other ways targeting political opponents, real and perceived, and imposing strong controls on freedoms of expression, assembly and association. Arbitrary detention, unfair trials and trumped up charges were commonly used, and abuses in custody up to and including torture and extrajudicial executions were widespread. </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">The EPRDF also fought a prolonged war against the Oromo Liberation Front (and its armed wing the Oromo Liberation Army, OLA), an Oromo nationalist group that had fought against the previous government of Mengistu Hailemariam and which in 1991 was briefly part of a transitional government led by the EPRDF coalition. The OLF always had an uneasy relationship with the TPLF, and these tensions led to the OLF leaving the transitional government in 1992 to take up a low-level armed struggle against the government.  The OLF stated that its fundamental objective was to exercise the Oromo peoples’ right to self-determination. The EPRDF viewed them as violent separatists threatening the integrity of the nation.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Moving to the years 2014 and 2015, spurred by the government’s systemic human rights repression, as well as economic and political marginalisation, youth in the Oromia and Amhara regions launched a wave of what would become large scale and sustained street demonstrations, of a kind that had not previously been seen in the country under the EPRDF. The government used excessive, and often lethal, force to quell the protests, killing, beating and arresting protesters. The protests continued until February 2018, when the then Prime Minister Hailemariam Dessalegn was forced to resign. He was replaced by a new Prime Minister, Abiy Ahmed, the first Oromo to hold the post.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">In an attempt to appease the public protest, Prime Minister Abiy, announced reforms to address economic issues as well as structural and systematic human rights issues. Thousands of prisoners who were serving sentences on politically motivated charges were released. The state of war with neighbouring Eritrea was ended and relations were normalised. Bans on many websites and independent news outlets were lifted; and a number of opposition groups were removed from the official government terrorist list. This latter move included the Oromo Liberation Front (OLF), whose leaders were told it was safe to return to the country from their prolonged exile abroad.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">In response, many senior political opponents in the Ethiopian diaspora, including a number of OLF figures, return to the country after agreeing to pursue peaceful means to achieve their political goals. National parliamentary elections were scheduled for 2020 and in November 2019 Prime Minister Abiy, as chairman of the EPRDF, dissolved the coalition and merged most of its constituent parties into a new coalition party to contest the elections, named the Prosperity Party. The TPLF did not become part of this new coalition party.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">However, despite the ambitious reform agenda pursued by Prime Minister Abiy, there were a number of key areas that remained untouched. In particular, the state security apparatus, including the Ethiopian National Defence Force (ENDF), the regional police forces and government-controlled local militias, remained largely unreformed. While the government took some steps to ensure accountability for past human rights violations (principally the prosecution of some federal security officers accused of torture and ill-treatment of detainees) little was done to address the abusive practices of security forces and the leadership, institutional culture and legal framework that enabled them. The truth about the depth of past human rights violations committed since 1991 is yet to come out and reparations for victims remained elusive. The bulk of past atrocities in Ethiopia – including widespread acts of killing, torture and other ill-treatment, and excessive use of force against protesters – remained unaccounted for.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">At the same time, the period during which Prime Minister Abiy’s government was instituting its human rights reforms was interspersed with political and ethnic tensions that prompted military insurgencies and inter-communal violence in Amhara, Oromia, Harar, Dire Dawa, Benishangul and the Southern Nations Nationalities and Peoples (SNNP) regions. In particular, a splinter wing broke away from the Oromo Liberation Army, the military wing of the OLF, after rejecting the OLF’s adoption of exclusively peaceful means. The OLA splinter group staged armed attacks in Western and Southern parts of Oromia. In response to the armed violence in January 2019 the government launched a law-enforcement offensive, ostensibly against the OLA, arguing that violent ethnic separatists posed a fundamental threat to the liberalising reform programme that Prime Minister Abiy was trying to institute.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2"><p class="EndnoteText"> See e.g. https:www.economist.com/by-invitation/2020/09/17/abiy-ahmed-on-the-threats-to-ethiopias-democratic-transition</p><p class="EndnoteText" /></authorialNote></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Over the next year, regional and federal security forces oversaw a campaign of mass arbitrary arrests and detentions; the routine use of torture and other serious ill-treatment; and the use of extrajudicial executions and enforced disappearances in the Oromia region and elsewhere. In addition, security forces have arbitrarily banned certain flags and expressions and/or the use of mobile phones; imposed internet blackouts and physical curfews, movement restrictions and checkpoints; and in some cases have been implicated in forced evictions. The OLA were not, however, the main target for these tactics. Oromo civilians resident in areas of suspected OLA activity were arbitrarily targeted and accused of providing practical and moral support to the OLA. Individuals perceived as being associated with the OLF, (whether through membership, support, historic association through security agency records, or family ties) were particularly targeted, on the pretext of support for the OLA and terrorist violence, but a far wider group of people, either associated with other Oromo nationalist groups, such as the Oromo Federalist Congress (OFC), or in some cases having no association beyond being Oromo and living in a certain area, were also caught up in these arrests.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Moving into 2020, the year was designated as a national election year, with parliamentary elections due to be held in August. However, following the start of the global coronavirus pandemic the National Electoral Board of Ethiopia (NEBE) postponed the elections indefinitely, on the grounds that it was not safe to conduct ordinary campaigning and polling practices. This was inevitably a highly contentious decision and how the country will move forward from this point is still being heatedly debated. Our current understanding of the official position is that the elections will now be held in May or June 2021.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3"><p class="EndnoteText"> See e.g. <a href="https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-politics/ethiopia-proposes-holding-postponed-vote-in-may-or-june-2021-fana-idUSKBN27F14A"><span class="Hyperlink">https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-ethiopia-politics/ethiopia-proposes-holding-postponed-vote-in-may-or-june-2021-fana-idUSKBN27F14A</span></a><span> </span></p></authorialNote></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">In the meantime, in a move that escalated the tension between the Federal government and the Regional government in Tigray, the TPLF - a party which controls all the seats in the Tigray Regional State Parliament – held a regional election in September 2020. This move was deemed unconstitutional by the NEBE and the results were not recognised by the national government. In response the government withheld the national budget allocation for the region, which has been met with a vociferous response from the TPLF leadership and heightened tensions.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="4"><p class="EndnoteText"> See e.g. htpps://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-53807187 </p></authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> During the period when this letter was being prepared, the Ethiopian government announced that military action would be taken against the TPLF in Tigray. The government blamed the TPLF for attacking the Ethiopian National Defence Force’s Northern Command based in the regional capital Mekelle, after “months of continued provocations and incitement for violence by the TPLF”.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/11/ethiopia-authorities-must-ensure-human-rights-are-respected-in-tigray-military-operator"><span class="Hyperlink">https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/11/ethiopia-authorities-must-ensure-human-rights-are-respected-in-tigray-military-operator</span></a></p></authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> While not directly relevant to this case, this is an important and concerning development both in its own terms and in demonstrating the strength of the Ethiopian federal government’s response to the rival ethnically-based regional political groupings it faces.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">In Oromia, prior to the general election’s suspension the OLF held a commanding lead in the polls and were widely predicted to win political control of the region away from the Oromo Democratic Party (formerly known as the Oromo Peoples’ Democratic Organisation (OPDO)), which has governed the region as part of the EPRDF coalition since 1991. However, the postponement of the elections was combined with both targeted arrests and killings of leading OLF figures and the ongoing use of mass-scale arbitrary arrests and other repressive tactics targeted at OLF activists and supporters in the region.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">In the early hours of 29 February 2020, security officers stormed a guest house in the southern part of Addis Ababa where five senior members of the OLF and four supporters were staying. All nine were arrested. While eight were subsequently released, Abdi Regassa, a member of the OLF’s Executive Committee who had previously returned to the country from exile following the 2018 reforms, was held in incommunicado detention.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="6"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/03/ethiopia-police-must-account-for-missing-oromo-opposition-leader/"><span class="Hyperlink">https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/03/ethiopia-police-must-account-for-missing-oromo-opposition-leader/</span></a><span> </span></p></authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> On 7th March, three OLF members, including a member of the Central Committee and a political officer, were arrested by police immediately after visiting Abdi Regassa.

None of the new appointees are new faces to the security sector; all have been part of the system for a very long time holding other senior posts. The reason for the reshuffle appears to be more to do with loyalty to Prime Minister Abiy and commitment to the current military operations against the TPLF, mentioned above, done with any reform agenda.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">With this background in mind, we will now address each of your questions in turn.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Question 1: Do Oromo Liberation Front members and sympathisers (whether perceived or otherwise) continue to be at real risk of persecution in Ethiopia?</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">As is set out in our summary of the background above, Ethiopia has undergone, and is continuing to undergo, significant political developments in the last few years. The change of Prime Minister has brought both a new agenda for government and some important symbolic developments in a country that continues to suffer from ethnic division and factionalism; in particular the coming to power of the first Oromo prime minister. However, there is an inherent tension in a liberalising reform agenda being pursued by a new Prime Minister at the head of a governing coalition that is very similar to the previous one, and without fundamental reform to the security services. This is particularly the case in the context of the ongoing popularity of influential regional/ethnic separatist movements such as the OLF, tensions between the federal government and the Tigray regional government of the TPLF, and increasing incidents of inter-ethnic violence across the country, particularly targeting minorities.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Despite the encouraging signs of the first months of Prime Minister Abiy’s rule, which, along with many others, our organisation praised at the time, we are increasingly concerned at what appears to be a downward spiral for human rights in the country. As was noted above, most recently this has been indicated by the announcement of a military operation against the TPLF, but has now long been the case in the Oromia, and also the Amhara, regions. What may have begun as a police action to deal with a relatively small armed splinter group, the OLA, and violent attacks on ethnic minorities in the region, particularly Amharas, has now in our assessment gone well beyond law enforcement.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="21"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/2358/2020/en"><span class="Hyperlink">https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/2358/2020/en</span></a><span> </span></p></authorialNote></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">It is increasingly apparent that the security apparatus has used the rise of a relatively small OLA as a pretext for a widespread crackdown on supporters and perceived supporters of Oromo nationalism in general and the OLF in particular, who are viewed as a threat to the territorial integrity of the state and an obstacle to the current government and its agenda. This crackdown has come in the context of Federal and Regional elections that, prior to their suspension due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the OLF and other nationalist parties were expected to do very well in; potentially displacing the political leadership the security services had been loyal to since the early 1990s. As discussed above, those with OLF backgrounds have been targeted in the crackdown, but so have others unconnected to the OLF but affiliated with other Oromo nationalist organisations, including journalists and others working for nationalist-sympathising media outlets, such as the Oromo Media Network (OMN) and members of other nationalist groups such as the OFC. Others still have also been caught up through participation in protests or mere residence in areas targeted by the security services. Those arrested are increasingly and routinely labelled as ‘OLF-Shene’; Shene being a term for the armed factions of the OLA. It is therefore more instructive, in our view, to focus on the question of Oromo people perceived as opponents of the new government, who are then as a result either perceived or labelled as OLF activists, than solely on those people with documented histories of OLF involvement specifically.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">As part of this, we would emphasise the extreme arbitrariness of the Ethiopian security services’ conduct in Oromia and in its dealings with Oromo people perceived as political opponents of the government. While this is a longstanding issue, it is particularly pronounced at the present time, where mass-roundups, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions are regular occurrences, alongside indiscriminate violence in response to public demonstration and perceived dissent. In Oromia, the grounds on which a person can be accused or perceived of being a supporter of the OLF, and therefore a potential supporter of the OLA and a threat to the government, are broad, dependent on the whims of the officers involved and to an extent unpredictable. As discussed in our ‘Beyond Law Enforcement’ report, in recent months the reasons have included simply being Oromo and living in a certain location, or because a person’s mobile phone rang and interrupted a public meeting.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="22"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/2358/2020/en"><span class="Hyperlink">https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/2358/2020/en</span></a><span> </span></p></authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> While specific individuals are certainly targeted, based on suspicion of OLF involvement, the arbitrariness of the security services’ conduct has meant that in multiple instances, where security officials were not able to find the suspects they were looking for, they arrested or abducted family members including children. In one instance, the police physically assaulted an 8-year-old girl, because they couldn’t find her mother at home when they came to arrest her.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="23"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/2358/2020/en"><span class="Hyperlink">https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/2358/2020/en</span></a></p></authorialNote></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">As a general statement, our organisation’s assessment is that Oromo Liberation Front members and sympathisers (whether perceived or otherwise) do continue to be at risk in Ethiopia. Further details about the nature and extent of that risk will be discussed in our response to the questions below.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Question 2: To what extent does the above depend on profile; (with reference to the appellant’s case for instance)?</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">There are a number of ways in which a person’s profile is relevant to the level of risk they face.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Firstly, much of the targeting of individuals perceived as members or supporters of the OLF is conducted by local militia and police forces, informing and working alongside federal forces operating in the region. These local militia and police officers are stationed in local communities, ostensibly providing protection and security services to the community, but also providing intelligence gathering on perceived anti-government activists and their supporters for the authorities. As has been, and will be, highlighted throughout this letter, security force operatives conduct themselves with high levels of arbitrariness and benefit from a high degree of impunity from accountability, even following the Prime Minister’s reforms. In this context, both formal arrest records and institutional as well as personal memory of individual officers play a major role in determining who is perceived as possessing an anti-government agenda and therefore subject to suspicion.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">This makes a history of arrest for OLF or other Oromo nationalist activity an important risk factor in the current context. It also makes a family history of OLF or other Oromo nationalist activity a significant risk factor. This institutional and personal memory at the local level routinely extends to identifying whole families as supporters of the OLF, based on the political activities of one or two members, or holding the whole family responsible for the activities of one or two members.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">While men, and young men in particular, make up the majority of those targeted by the authorities or caught up in mass arrests, gender and age do not appear to offer any significant level of protection against suspicion and targeting by the authorities. Our researchers found that women are routinely targeted for arrest, often on accusations of providing support for the ‘OLF-Shene’. Likewise, older people and children have also been targeted, particularly those who have family connections to ‘OLF-Shene’ suspects.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Another factor relates to the person’s stature within the organisation, or the extent of their public profile. While this is hard to precisely delineate, given the arbitrary nature of the security forces’ conduct and the ever-changing circumstances in the country, there does appear to be some limited protection from arrest afforded to very senior and prominent members of the OLF, whose arrest would risk causing disproportionate adverse consequences for the government. For example, as discussed above the chairman of the OLF, Daud Ibssa, has not been imprisoned. However, it appears that in these circumstances alternative methods are used to inhibit their capacity to operate effectively, including house arrest, communication shutdowns and the arrest of middle-ranking individuals working under and alongside them, thus leaving them isolated. At the same time, rank and file members and supporters benefit from no such protection.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Beyond personal profile elements, there are two points regarding geography that we also consider to be relevant profile factors in the question of risk.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Firstly, we have noted the statement in the Home Office’s Country Policy and Information Note that,</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">‘the available evidence does not indicate that all OLF activists, members or supporters … </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">throughout Ethiopia</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> are at risk of treatment amounting to persecution by its nature and/or repetition. The assessment of risk for a person </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">will vary between different areas of Ethiopia</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> and within Oromia itself’ (emphasis added)</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="24"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/900975/CPIN_-_Ethiopia_-_Opposition_to_the_government.pdf"><span class="Hyperlink">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/900975/CPIN_-_Ethiopia_-_Opposition_to_the_government.pdf</span></a><span> </span></p></authorialNote></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">We are concerned that this is potentially misleading, insofar as it implies that the entirety of the country of Ethiopia is a relevant consideration in this case. The OLF, and those perceived as supporting it, are present essentially exclusively in Oromia and the capital Addis Ababa (which is in any case geographically encircled by Oromia). The realistic question, therefore, is whether there are areas of Oromia or Addis Ababa where the risks identified in MB no longer apply.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">On this second point, we note that the CPIN states that,</span></p>

      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">And goes on to argue that,</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">‘OLF members or supporters in Oromia, particularly in areas where armed conflict between the OLA and the armed forces continues, face a higher risk of treatment that amounts to persecution than those in Addis Ababa.’</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="26"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/900975/CPIN_-_Ethiopia_-_Opposition_to_the_government.pdf"><span class="Hyperlink">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/900975/CPIN_-_Ethiopia_-_Opposition_to_the_government.pdf</span></a><span> </span></p></authorialNote></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">This section of the CPIN concludes by asserting that a person who is a member or supporter of the OLF is not at risk of persecution for that reason alone, and that each case must be considered on its facts, including the ‘proposed place of return’ the person would be being sent to.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="27"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/900975/CPIN_-_Ethiopia_-_Opposition_to_the_government.pdf"><span class="Hyperlink">https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/900975/CPIN_-_Ethiopia_-_Opposition_to_the_government.pdf</span></a><span> </span></p></authorialNote></p>

In the last year, our organisation has documented hundreds of arrests of OLF members and perceived supporters in East and West Hararghe (eastern zones of Oromia), North, west and east Shewa (northern zones of Oromia, around Addis Ababa), and East and West Arsi (central zones of Oromia).</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="28"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/2538/2020/en/"><span class="Hyperlink">https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/afr25/2538/2020/en/</span></a></p></authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> Incidents like these are illustrative of the widespread nature of the crackdown on those perceived as OLF supporters throughout the Oromia region.</span></p>

      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">The final points we would make regarding the extent to which a person perceived as an OLF supporter’s profile would affect the level of risk they face relates to their recent and ongoing participation in activism for the Oromo nationalist cause.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">While, in our view, individuals being returned to Ethiopia from the UK with a known history of OLF support, whether that be an arrest history or otherwise, face a significant risk for that reason alone, individuals who go on to continue their activism with the OLF on return will inevitably face an even greater risk. Likewise, individuals who have engaged in significant recent activism on behalf of the OLF, or other Oromo nationalist groups, while in the UK may also face a greater risk. This would include participation at the large-scale, and at times disorderly, demonstrations that have taken place outside the Ethiopian embassy in London over the summer of 2020.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="30"><p class="EndnoteText"> See e.g. <a href="https://borkena.com/2020/08/25/radical-oromo-mob-took-down-ethiopian-flag-at-the-embassy-in-london/"><span class="Hyperlink">https://borkena.com/2020/08/25/radical-oromo-mob-took-down-ethiopian-flag-at-the-embassy-in-london/</span></a><span> </span></p></authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> These demonstrations were closely monitored by the Ethiopian authorities, who reportedly raised diplomatic complaints with the British government over what they perceived to be the British police’s failure to appropriately protect the Embassy and its staff.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="31"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://borkena.com/2020/08/25/radical-oromo-mob-took-down-ethiopian-flag-at-the-embassy-in-london/"><span class="Hyperlink">https://borkena.com/2020/08/25/radical-oromo-mob-took-down-ethiopian-flag-at-the-embassy-in-london/</span></a></p></authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> The events have also been widely reported in Ethiopian media and videos have been circulated online amongst both supporters and opponents of the OLF’s cause.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="32"><p class="EndnoteText"><a href="https://www.youtube/watch?v=VB1zG9yQxRw&amp;ab_channel=ZenaTube"><span class="Hyperlink">https://www.youtube/watch?v=VB1zG9yQxRw&amp;ab_channel=ZenaTube</span></a><span> </span></p></authorialNote></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">With reference to [the appellant], the appellant in this case, our organisation has not previously documented his case and we are therefore not able to comment on his background directly. We would note, however, that his claimed background, as summarised above, is in our experience very common amongst young supporters and activists for the OLF or the wider Oromo nationalist movement, including a family history of involvement, youth engagement and serious adverse experience with the Ethiopian security forces. If his background is accepted by the Tribunal, in our organisation’s view it contains a number of elements that in combination would indicate a significant risk of being perceived as a supporter of the OLF, including his age and gender, his family history of involvement with the OLF and his arrest history.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Question 3: Are you able to comment on the assertion by the Home Office at 2.4.26 of their July CPIN on Ethiopia that there are very strong grounds supported by cogent evidence to depart from the Upper Tribunal findings in the current country guidance case of MB (OLF and MTA – risk) Ethiopia CG [2007] UKAIT 00030 (29 March 2007) set out at 2.4.21 - 22 of the current CPIN on opposition to the Government?</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Having read the MB case, it is our understanding that it finds that OLF members and sympathisers and those specifically perceived by the authorities to be such members or sympathisers will in general be at real risk if they have been previously arrested or detained on suspicion of OLF involvement. So too will those who have a significant history, known to the authorities, of OLF membership or sympathy.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Based on our ongoing research into the recent events of 2019 and 2020 documented in our published reports, it is our organisation’s assessment that while much has changed in Ethiopia since MB was promulgated in 2007, the situation has not improved sufficiently to justify an assertion that the risk assessment made in MB is no longer valid. Indeed, in our assessment, the nature and the extent of the current risks may be broader than the above summary position given in MB would seem to imply, insofar as the need for a ‘significant’ history of membership or sympathy for the OLF does not reflect the extent of the mass and arbitrary arrests of Oromo people, including those with little realistic connection to the OLF and the increasing targeting of other non-OLF Oromo nationalist groups, and other abuses that are being perpetrated in the Oromia region.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">One caveat we would make to this assessment is that some former OLF and other exiled opposition group members are now active supporters of the new government such as by taking up government posts or through supporting the party in public electoral activities.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="33"><p class="EndnoteText"> E.g. Mr Taye Dendea, who previously served jail terms of three and seven years on charges that he belonged to the OLF is now working as a PR for the Oromia Prosperity Party. Mr Lencho Bati, formerly chairman of the exiled Oromo Democratic Front, is now an advisor to the Prime Minister. </p></authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> We do not consider such people to be at significant risk, absent other factors, as the underlying basis of the risk is to Oromo people perceived by the authorities to be opponents of the new government, in the context of arbitrary decision making over suspicion or ’innocence’ conducted by local militia and police officers acting with impunity and with political and institutional loyalty to the new government. A former OLF member or supporter who went out of their way to demonstrate that they had withdrawn themselves entirely from politics might also be able to benefit from some level of protection, but this would be less reliable and in the arbitrary context described above, would be very difficult to precisely define.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">For these reasons, and those given in our answers to questions 1,2 and 4, while we agree with the Home Office’s assessment that since Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed came to power in April 2018 there has been an important change in the political landscape, we are respectfully of the view that the Country Policy and Information Note overstates the case by arguing that these constitute sufficient grounds for departing from the risk criteria identified in MB.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Question 4: The present position of members and supporters of the OLF vis-a-vis government security forces?</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Firstly, and perhaps most importantly, as we have noted above, despite Prime Minister Abiy’s reform programme the security forces remain largely unreformed across any of the relevant metrics, including personnel, leadership, institutional culture, political independence and accountability. This has been amply demonstrated by their activities in Oromia and elsewhere over 2019 and now into 2020. Moreover, their actions, which include engaging in mass arbitrary arrests and the use of extreme violence up to and including extrajudicial executions and torture, have been given political cover and downplayed by Prime Minister Abiy and his leadership group as merely ‘robust measures’.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="34"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2020/09/17/abiy-ahmed-on-the-threats-to-ethiopias-democratic-transition"><span class="Hyperlink">https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2020/09/17/abiy-ahmed-on-the-threats-to-ethiopias-democratic-transition</span></a><span> </span></p></authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> Indeed, the reform programme has itself been invoked as justification for these actions, with the argument that a strong response is necessary to deal with those that the government views as opponents or obstacles to its agenda.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="35"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2020/09/17/abiy-ahmed-on-the-threats-to-ethiopias-democratic-transition"><span class="Hyperlink">https://www.economist.com/by-invitation/2020/09/17/abiy-ahmed-on-the-threats-to-ethiopias-democratic-transition</span></a><span> </span></p></authorialNote></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Secondly the reliance placed on the fact that a number of key OLF figures returned to Ethiopia in 2018 for evidence that it is now safe for OLF supporters to return is, in our view, undermined by many of those leaders’ subsequent arrest and detention. As we noted above, both Abdi Regassa and Daud Ibssa have been arrested and detained since returning. Other senior OLF figures detained since return include Michael Boran, Shigut Geleta, Lemi Benya, Kenessa Ayana and Colonel Gemechu Ayana.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="36"><p class="EndnoteText"><span> </span><a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/07/ethiopia-account-for-all-people-arrested-after-hachalu-hundesa-killing/"><span class="Hyperlink">https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2020/07/ethiopia-account-for-all-people-arrested-after-hachalu-hundesa-killing/</span></a><span> </span></p></authorialNote></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">The ongoing use of sweeping powers of detention against thousands of perceived OLF/OLA supporters may differ from previous periods of OLF suppression in terms of political context and external justification, but this does not change the reality of ongoing suppression of the Oromo nationalist movement and those Oromos perceived as engaging in dissent by security services loyal to the current government and acting with near total impunity.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Question 5: Is there today likely to be a presumption by the state that an Oromo person on return to Ethiopia is a member of, affiliated to or associated with the OLF?</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">It is not our organisation’s view that any Oromo person being returned to Ethiopia from the UK would be presumed by the state to be associated with the OLF. As has already been noted, there are Oromo people in senior positions in the Ethiopian government, including the Prime Minister himself; the region is currently governed by an ethnic Oromo party loyal to the national government; and it is policed largely by locally recruited police officers and militia members. As such, we do not consider that there is a universal presumption of Oromo ethnicity equating to opposition to the government generally or support for the OLF specifically.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">That said, we do consider that the circumstances of an Oromo person being forcibly returned from the UK to Ethiopia, whether or not the Ethiopian authorities were aware that they were being returned as a failed asylum seeker, would be likely to give rise to at least some initial suspicion of the individual by the authorities, which could in turn prompt some further enquiries and background checks. If these enquiries were to reveal a connection to the OLF or other Oromo opposition groups, then the considerations relating to risk described in our answers to the questions above would apply.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Conclusion</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">Since coming to power in 2018, Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has instituted a number of important reforms that opened up an opportunity for fundamental human rights change in Ethiopia, including the release of political prisoners and the repeal of a range of repressive laws. However, a number of areas remain largely or entirely unreformed, most pertinently the state security apparatus, which remains politically loyal to the governing party and which engages in arbitrary and extremely abusive practices, including mass arrests, incommunicado detention, torture and extrajudicial execution. At the same time, the government has been confronted by increasing ethnic tensions in the country, intercommunal violence and the growing influence of nationalist, self-determination and independence movements in various regions of Ethiopia. The government sees these movements both as obstacles to its agenda and as potential threats to the territorial integrity of the nation.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">The state security apparatus, under the command of the government and with its political backing, has engaged in serious human rights abuses across the country, but particularly in the Oromia region, which is home to an ambitious and popular nationalist movement for self-determination. This security apparatus has used the rise of a relatively small armed splinter faction, the OLA, as a pretext for a widespread crackdown on supporters and perceived supporters of Oromo nationalism in general and the OLF in particular. This crackdown has come in the context of Federal and Regional elections that, prior to their suspension due to the Coronavirus pandemic, the OLF were expected to do very well in; potentially displacing the political leadership the security services have been loyal to since the early 1990s.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">The crackdown has been characterised by extreme brutality, including public extrajudicial executions and other forms of extreme arbitrary and indiscriminate violence. Rather than focus its efforts on targeting and confronting the relatively small armed splinter faction from the OLA, which has undoubtedly committed grave human rights abuses itself, the security services have instead focused on civilians in Oromia and suspected OLF supporters in particular. Thousands have been arrested and detained for prolonged indefinite periods on broad and unparticularised grounds of suspected support for terrorism and the OLA. Thousands remain detained to this day.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">In this context, it is our organisation’s assessment that the overall risk assessment findings of the MB case remain appropriate, and may even be too narrow, even if the background justification for them has changed.</span></p>
