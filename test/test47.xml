              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">This decision relates to an application by the appellant for permission from the tribunal to make late appeals against a variety of amendments and notices relating to both income tax and VAT. We describe those appealable matters in relation to income tax as the “</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">income tax matters</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”, and the appealable matters in respect of VAT as the “</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">VAT matters</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”. The income tax matters, and the VAT matters are collectively described as the “</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">appealable matters</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”. Originally there were over 50 appealable matters , but by the time of the hearing, these had been whittled down to those detailed in Appendix 1.</span></p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The appealable matters arise out of enquiries commenced in respect of VAT, by HMRC in 2013, and in respect of income tax by HMRC in March 2017.</span></p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In a nutshell, the appellant’s position as regards the VAT matters is that notification of them was never sent by HMRC nor received by him. Even if he was on notice of those matters by dint of their inclusion in the bankruptcy petition of 11 June 2018 (the “</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman'">bankruptcy petition</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”) there was insufficient detail of the VAT matters in the bankruptcy petition to enable him to make an appeal, and HMRC did not provide him with the requisite detail notwithstanding repeated requests for it. Once he had sufficient detail, he made an appeal. This was on 28 September 2020. HMRC’s position as regards the VAT matters is that the relevant notices were both sent and received by the appellant or his agent. Even if that was not the case, there was sufficient detail in the bankruptcy petition to enable the appellant to make an appeal, and indeed that is what the appellant’s current representative did as regards some but not all of the appealable matters, on 28 September 2020. There is no evidence of the appellant’s former agent asking for detailed information over and above that set out in the bankruptcy petition between the date of that petition, and the date of the limited appeal on 28 September 2020.</span></p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">As regards the appellant’s position concerning the income tax matters, it is slightly different. The appellant accepts that the relevant notices were served by HMRC and received by himself or his agent, but that agent employed two individuals who, for reasons unknown to anyone, simply failed to action those notices. This was against their office policy, and the individuals have been dismissed. The appellant’s position regarding the information in the bankruptcy petition is the same as his position in respect of the VAT matters. HMRC’s position too is the same as regards the information in the bankruptcy petition, and the fact that the appellant could readily have brought an appeal immediately following the bankruptcy petition but did not do so, on a limited basis, until 28 September 2020. And the behaviour of the appellant’s agent’s employees was nothing more than failure to comply with office procedure. The failings of that agent should be imputed to the appellant.</span></p>

If it was very short (which would, in the absence of unusual circumstances, equate to the breach being “neither serious nor significant”), then the FTT “is unlikely to need to spend much time on the second and third stages” – though this should not be taken to mean that applications can be granted for very short delays without even moving on to a consideration of those stages. </span></p>

Furthermore, the appellant emailed HMRC on 26 June 2017 as regards VAT and was able to say “I am just finishing getting all the VAT invoices together…” This was in response to an email from HMRC indicating that they had “not received any response to my schedule 36 notices request for purchase invoices”.</span></p>

In his second witness statement, however, he corrected this, and indicated that during his preparation for the hearing on 15 March 2022, letters from HMRC to Howards relating to the income tax self-assessment enquiry were identified and brought to his attention.</span></p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">His primary position is that HMRC have not established that the appealable matters were validly notified to the appellant in the first place. All they have provided, as evidence, are copies of the appealable matters and covering letters. This does not satisfy the first limb of section 7 Interpretation Act 1978. We disagree. This is not a case where HMRC have simply produced a computer printout and asked us to infer from that that it must have been sent to an appellant. HMRC have provided copies of the appealable matters and covering letters, all of which the appellant had accepted in evidence have been correctly addressed. HMRC have not produced an officer to speak to the system that they adopt towards putting these letters into envelopes and ensuring that those envelopes are prepaid, but the presumption of regularity has not been displaced by the appellant in this case. There is no evidence of “return to sender”.We find that it is more likely than not that the copies of the documents which have been produced to us were put into prepaid envelopes and, having been correctly addressed, sent to the appellant. And, where copies were sent to Howards, they were sent to Howards.</p>

As regards the VAT matters, there appears to be a distinction between those matters which were sent by email, which the appellant accepts that he received, and those which were sent by post, of which appellant denies receipt. Mr Avient submits that this is a logical distinction. Ms Davies points out that the appellant’s evidence on this is confused; at one point he accepted that he had received the penalty notices, but not received the income tax or VAT assessments. But the appellant appeared to deny this in re-examination. We accept that there is evidence to show that the appellant had passed emails he had received from HMRC to Howards, and that he had passed a letter from HMRC to them. On the basis of this we are prepared to accept that had he received the VAT matters he would have sent them to Howards. And the fact that Howards received none is evidence that the appellant had not received them in the first place. We are, therefore, prepared to accept his evidence that he did not receive the VAT matters.</p>

We believe this to be a typo, and the date was 23 July 2018. We say this on the basis that the appellant’s case is that HMRC were continuously dilatory in responding to repeated requests for clarification of the matters set out in the bankruptcy petition between 2018 and 2020, and because of that inTax were instructed, in September 2020, to resolve the position. If the bankruptcy petition been received only in July 2020, this submission would fall away since it seems to us that HMRC could not have been over dilatory between July 2020 and September 2020. Furthermore, the letter itself refers to a letter of 2 July 2020 requesting a breakdown of credits, which could not have been sent had the bankruptcy petition only come to Howards’ attention 3 weeks later on 23 July 2020. We find as a fact that the bankruptcy petition came to Howards’ attention on 23 July 2018.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">So since that date, it had been clear to Howards that HMRC had assessed the appellant to tax and visited penalty notices on the appellant in respect of those matters identified in the bankruptcy petition. If therefore we take the date as starting on 23 July 2018 and ending on the date of the earliest appeal on 28 September 2020, the delay is still over 2 years. This is serious and significant, and we do not believe that the appellant would argue to the contrary.</p>

He accepts that the income tax matters had been notified to the appellant by dint of valid service on and receipt by Howards. But although the general rule is that failings by an agent should be attributed to a taxpayer as set out in <span style="font-style:italic">Katib</span>, that should not apply here because the individual employees at Howards choose to work outside the firm’s procedures meaning that Howards was as much a victim as was the appellant, and that, in these circumstances, the failings by Howards should not be attributed to the appellant.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Regrettably for the appellant, we do not agree that this is a good reason. The evidence shows, as submitted by Ms Davies, that these employees simply failed to comply with office procedure. They might have done so in a significant way, and the consequences of that failure, on the appellant, might be dramatic. But it is not such rogue behaviour as to take the attribution of Howards’ failings to the appellant outside the <span style="font-style:italic">Katib</span> principle. Simply failing to comply with office procedure, in this case escalating the matters up to a director, rather than dealing with them oneself, is simply a breach of office protocol for which, we accept, an employer might be dismissed. But it is not such a frolic of their own as to enable us to say that there was such a fundamental breach of Howards’ duty to the appellant as to, effectively, mean that they were not properly acting as agent. </p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is our view that in the same way that an agent’s failings are attributed to a taxpayer, the failings by that agent’s employees are attributed to that agent. Indeed in many cases where a large firm is appointed agent, and time limits are missed it is highly likely that the failure is due to a failure by an employee.  It would not seem right to us that if, for example, KPMG were appointed agent with its huge numbers of employees, a taxpayer could say that the attribution principle does not apply because one of the employees had not complied with office procedure..  Unless the behaviour of the employee is so exceptionally egregious or vindictive that management could not be expected to police it, and it falls far outside the ambit of  behaviour expected of an employee, failures by the employee should be attributed to the employer. And the employees’ failings in this case are not in that category. The employees might have been negligent or even irresponsible, but in our view that negligence or irresponsibility must be attributed to Howards. This might sound harsh, but in our view it is up to the appellant to take this up with Howards, rather than something which exonerates the appellant from the consequences of the behaviour of Howards’ former employees.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In any case, this behaviour applies only in respect of periods before Howards received a copy of the bankruptcy petition. The appellant’s position as regards delays since then is that they did not understand the matters set out in the petition as there was insufficient detail in it, and despite repeated requests for clarification and detail, HMRC did not supply it. One reason for the delay, therefore, was HMRC’s failure to supply that information, and case law suggests that this is a significant factor that can be taken into account when considering the reasons for delay.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This is clearly a compelling point. If the appellant can clearly show that it was not possible to determine the appealable decisions from the bankruptcy petition and that HMRC had not supplied information, despite repeated repeated requests for it, to clarify the position, then that could indeed, potentially, be a good reason for the failure to make a timely appeal after receipt of the bankruptcy petition.</p>

Given it is such an important point to the appellant, we would have thought that any communications between Howards and HMRC following receipt of the bankruptcy petition, would have been included in the bundle of documents provided to us. Not only was nothing supplied in the original bundle, but only two pieces of correspondence were included in the supplemental bundle which could provide such evidence. The first is Howards’ letter on 21 September 2020, the second is inTax’s letter of 16 November 2020.</p>

We are being asked to infer that it took place between July 2018 and September 2020, but this is an inference which we are not able to make. It may simply be a reflection of the letters of 2 July 2020 and 28 July 2020 and responses to those letters.</p>

Furthermore, as mentioned above, Mr Bailey has not produced any of the asserted correspondence, nor indeed was the letter of 21 September 2020 put to him, so that he could explain, in more detail, the nature of the correspondence referred to in it.</p>

The logic is that therefore even if the appellant had made a protective appeal in July or August 2018, it would not necessarily have been accepted by HMRC. But it would have made it a great deal easier for the appellant to argue that he had made a timely appeal since he had made it (even if there was then a dispute about its validity) very shortly after he received notice of the extent of the appealable decisions set out in the bankruptcy petition.</p>

But where the appealable matters were apparent from the bankruptcy petition, we do not think that the justification for the late appeal, namely that there was insufficient detail from the bankruptcy petition to enable the appellant to make an appeal, is valid.
