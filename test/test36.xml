The initial testing is undertaken on vehicles purchased by the Appellant by way of a “mystery shopping” exercise; both the purchases and the testing is funded by the Appellant.  The results of the tests (usually giving rise to substandard or unsatisfactory outcomes) are published and socialised. These results inform and influence customer buying behaviour which in turn drives manufacturers to improve the safety features.  Having improved safety in this way the manufactures proactively seek (and pay for) further testing, utilising the improved ratings in the market.</p>

However, HMRC considered that the initial testing funded by the Appellant represented a non-business activity to which residual input tax (incurred in connection with the Appellant’s activities generally and as a whole) should, in part, be attributed.  They raised the assessments by reference to the information available on the basis that there should be a 40% restriction on general overhead input tax recovery.</p>

In the period covered by the appeal NCAPs have been seeded in south-east Asia, Latin America, India and South Africa.  New jurisdictions for establishment of a programme are identified by the Appellant by reference to road fatality statistics.  The Appellant funds local NCAPs in relation to the initial purchase of vehicles to be tested.  </p>

                <p class="Taxbodytext2" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.38in">In the start up phase for an NCAP it is necessary to test vehicles without manufacturer support as the independence of the testing programme is critical in order to establish consumer credibility.   These initial tests are funded by the Appellant.</p>

              <content>
                <p class="Taxbodytext2" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.38in">The testing programme typically involves a number of crash tests on a particular model of car through which forward and side impact to the vehicle is monitored.  The tests use instrumented dummies to measure the crash forces that can lead to injury.  The testing facilities used by the Appellant are not located in the UK.</p>

              <content>
                <p class="Taxbodytext2" style="margin-left:0.39in;text-indent:0.38in">The early phase of testing frequently exposes that the vehicles manufactured in an economy with historically low car (or certainly new car) ownership, perform poorly.  It is often the case that in these emerging markets the vehicles manufactured do not meet the minimum safety standards set by the United Nations.  As a consequence it is rarely in the manufacturers’ interests to obtain the first baseline safety assessment.</p>

Manufacturers then proactively seek and make payment for the testing of these improved models.  In essence the manufacturers want to show the market that safety has been improved deriving commercial advantage from that improvement.  Such manufacturers will use the improved ratings in their own marketing of the vehicles.  By way of example the Renault Kwid when originally launched in India in 2016 received a zero-star rating, however, when the revised model was launched in 2018 it had 4 air bags, Renault paid for a safety test thereby credentialising the improvement in safety.</p>

In parallel the Indian Government improved the regulated safety environment mandating the minimum UN crash test standards.

In that case the taxpayer undertook both economic/business and non-economic activities from the cathedral building to which the bridge provided access.  The bridge provided access to the peninsula on which the cathedral was stood but users of the bridge may, or may not, access the cathedral and only some of those who accessed the cathedral would be the recipient of taxable supplies.  HMRC had denied input tax recovery for the works on the basis that they were attributable to the non-business activities of that taxpayer. The FTT determined that whilst there was no direct and immediate link to any particular taxable supply the costs represented a component of both the non-business and business activities carried on and a proportion of the costs were recoverable.

Manufactures work within the legal and regulatory framework in each jurisdiction and, presumably, aim to manufacture the most competitively priced vehicles at each price point.  It is not until consumers and/or regulators/legislators demand a higher safety standard at each relevant price point that manufacturers design vehicles to meet that higher standard.  Once improvements have been made the manufacturers then wish to proactively demonstrate that improvement by obtaining a higher test result which they can then use to credentialise the vehicle.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Through the purchase and testing of new entrant vehicles in each market jurisdiction the Appellant can establish a baseline of safety for vehicle production in that market.  This is an investment it makes with the underlying objective of driving better vehicle safety, but which forms the foundation from which to make taxable supplies of testing.   In this regard, the position is materially indistinguishable from that in <span style="font-style:italic">Sveda</span>.  The testing costs represent a necessary precursor to making taxable supplies and are directly.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The Associated Newspapers case concerned (in part) the recovery of input tax incurred by the taxpayer in connection with a promotion scheme pursuant to which the taxpayer bought in retail gift vouchers and provided them for free to readers meeting the conditions of the promotion scheme.  In a second limb to the dispute HMRC contended that if input tax was to be recovered in connection with the purchase of the voucher output tax was due when they were given away.  The Court of Appeal (upholding the Upper Tribunal) determined (as contended by the taxpayer) that the evidence had established that despite the fact that the vouchers were given away the input tax incurred on their purchase was a general overhead cost of and directly linked to the supply of newspapers.   Despite there being a causal link between the purchase of the voucher and it being given away there was nevertheless an economic link between the cost of the voucher and the distribution of the newspapers.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The Court further held that no output tax charge was due on the free provision of the voucher.  The Court rejected HMRC’s contention that to permit input tax recovery without an associated output tax charge breached the principle of fiscal neutrality on the basis that the input tax was recoverable on the basis that it was an overhead of the business of supplying newspapers and the free provision of the vouchers was “fiscally irrelevant” to the right of deduction.  As the vouchers were given away for a business purpose they did not otherwise fall within the charge to output tax where goods/services are put to private/non-business purposes.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Similarly, in the present case, the Tribunal considers that the provision of free testing is an inherent and integral part of the Appellant’s business activity giving rise and as such there is no basis on which to restrict input tax.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The above conclusion is not affected by the restriction in the Appellant’s articles of association precluding it from engaging in a trading activity.  That is a standard article for a charity and concerns its direct tax status.  Charities are no precluded from being engaged in a business activity for VAT purposes by reference to such a clause.  Had there been any force in that argument it would also have vitiated HMRC’s accepted position on the manufacturer funded testing.</p>
