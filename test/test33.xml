            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">I am concerned with two unrelated cases that involve a local authority accommodating and placing each of the mothers together with their young child in an unregulated residential family placement (“the placement”). In both cases the local authority applies to the court to sanction these placements through the exercise of its inherent jurisdiction or alternatively by directing the assessment of each child pursuant to s38(6) of the Children Act (1989) (the ‘Act’). Given the common issue to both cases, I have heard them sequentially.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">The first case concerns K who is almost eight weeks old. She has lived with her mother all of her life. She is the subject of applications by the local authority for public law orders. The court made her the subject of an interim care order when it approved the local authority’s interim care plan placing K and her mother is a residential unit where she and her mother would be assessed. Regrettably, following a serious incident in the placement, on 22 June 2022 it came to an abrupt end. The only available placement was an alternative residential placement where K and her mother reside to date. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">On 28 June 2022, the case returned to court and questions were raised about the suitability of the placement. On further investigation, it transpired that the placement is not a registered or regulated placement and the matter was subsequently allocated to me. The local authority concedes that it should have made the necessary enquiries prior to the mother and child being placed there. However, it argues that this was the only available placement which ensured that K was not separated from her mother. The local authority has continued its searches of regulated placements and there are no immediate options available.</p>
          </content>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph eId="para_4">
          <num style="font-style:normal;font-size:12pt;margin-left:0.64in;text-indent:-0.25in">4.</num>
          <content>
            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">Pending the identification of a regulated placement, the local authority has applied to invoke the court’s inherent jurisdiction by seeking the court’s approval and authorisation for the continuing placement of K and her mother. Latterly, the local authority had applied in the alternative for directions for assessment of K pursuant to s 38(6) of the Children Act (1989). As its case has crystalised, the local authority’s primary application is the latter of the two applications. The mother supports any mechanism through which her continuing care of K is assured and supports the local authority’s applications. The guardian and Cafcass resist the applications. It is submitted on behalf K that it is an inappropriate use of the court’s inherent jurisdiction or the statutory frame work to authorise an illegal placement where little is known about the suitability of the placement as a place of safety or as an assessment centre. It is further argued on behalf of K that this would be an inappropriate use of said provisions of the Act where the local authority has failed to demonstrate the unit’s capacity to appropriately undertake an assessment. Subsequently, the guardian has been able to visit the placement and following the provision of further information, her position has softened but continues to argue that it would be contrary to general policy that the court should sanction a placement in the face of the relevant statutory frame work that otherwise renders the placement illegal.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">The local authority now makes identical applications in the second case which concerns R who is eight weeks old. Following his birth, he and the mother have resided  in the said placement after the mother gave her agreement to be accommodated pursuant to s20 of the said Act. Subsequently, on 13 May 2022, the local authority applied for public law orders in respect of R who was made the subject of an Interim Care Order on 19 May 2022. </p>

I merely observe that cases such as this demonstrate the continuing need for a remedy which, despite its antiquity, has shown, is showing and must continue to show a remarkable adaptability to meet the ever emerging needs of an ever changing world. I add that the use of the jurisdiction in cases where the risk to a child is of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention – risk to life or risk of degrading or inhuman treatment – is surely unproblematic. So wardship is surely an appropriate remedy, even if the child has already left the jurisdiction, in cases where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad for the purposes of a forced marriage (as in Re KR and Re B) or so that she can be subjected to female genital mutilation or (as here) where the fear is that a child has been taken abroad to travel to a dangerous war-zone. There is no need for me to go any further, so I need not consider whether there are other kinds of situation where a child who is already abroad should be made a ward of court or whether wardship is an appropriate remedy where the risk to the child is of harm falling short of harm of the type that would engage Articles 2 or 3 of the Convention. </span></p>

To my mind the central focus of this aspect of the inherent jurisdiction is on the welfare and safety of children rather than on the potential commission of a criminal offence under section 11 of the Care Standards Act 2000 by others. Obviously, that central focus requires the court to give anxious and detailed consideration to the risks to the child in respect of a placement in which such an offence may be committed. However, the High Court is not required to determine whether an offence will be committed or whether the individual has an available defence. It is sufficient for the court to be aware of the potential that such an offence may be committed by another and to examine how that impacts on the best interests of the child. It is no part of the court’s function to “authorise” the commission of any criminal offence. Any order under the inherent jurisdiction does not do so. Rather, if the inherent jurisdiction is used, then the court “authorises” but does not “require” the placement by a local authority of a child in an unregistered children’s home despite the potential that a person may be prosecuted for and convicted of an offence under section 11 of the Care Standards Act 2000. If a prosecution is brought, which it can be, then it is a matter for the criminal courts to determine whether an offence has been committed and if so, as to the appropriate sentence to impose.</span></p>

The defences postulated are “necessity/duress of circumstances”. I agree with the submission of the Secretary of State that the inherent jurisdiction can be used but reject the proposed qualification as to the circumstances in which it can be used. The existence of a defence to a criminal charge misplaces the focus of the inherent jurisdiction which at all times is on the child. The inherent jurisdiction is available despite the potential that a person may be prosecuted for and convicted of an offence under section 11 of the Care Standards Act 2000: that possibility does not abrogate or restrict the inherent jurisdiction. The jurisdiction exists to protect children, not to decide issues of criminal liability.</span></p>

I also agree that where “there is absolutely no alternative, and where the child (or someone else) is likely to come to grave harm if the court does not act” that it is “a permissible exercise of the inherent jurisdiction to authorise a local authority to place a child in an unregistered children’s home in relation to which a criminal offence would be being committed” (para 145 above with emphasis added). In this context, as in the context of section 31 of the Children Act 1989 (see Lord Nicholls in In re H (Minors) (Sexual Abuse: Standard of Proof) </span><a href="http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/redirect.cgi?path=/uk/cases/UKHL/1995/16.html" title="Link to BAILII version"><span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#0000FF">[1996] AC 563</span></a><span style="font-style:italic">, 585), “likely” should be taken to mean a real possibility, that cannot sensibly be ignored having regard to the nature and gravity of the feared harm in the particular case. Accordingly, the courts, in the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction, must only authorise such a placement where there are “imperative considerations of necessity” and where there has been strict compliance with the matters contained in the Guidance issued by the President of the Family Division on 12 November 2019 in relation to placing a child in an unregistered children’s home (“the Guidance”) (see para 147 above) and with the addendum dated 1 December 2020 to the Guidance. Furthermore, if a placement is authorised in an unregistered children’s home then the court must monitor the progress of the application for registration in accordance with the Guidance and, if registration is not achieved, the court must rigorously review its continued approval of the child’s placement in an unregistered home.</span></p>

It is the Guidance to which reference should be made. At para 167 above I set out how the issues in the present case developed, such that certain factual findings were lacking.

The requirement extends to the local authority providing a copy of the order and the judgment of the court to either Ofsted or the CIW. In this way Ofsted or the CIW will be aware of the unregistered children’s home so that immediate steps can be taken to register. Thereafter, the aim of the Guidance is to work expeditiously towards registration, so as to comply, as soon as possible, with the requirement to register under section 11 of the Care Standards Act 2000 or section 5 of the Regulation and Inspection of Social Care (Wales) Act 2016. The Guidance requires the court to monitor the progress of the application for registration and, if registration is not achieved, to review its continued approval of the child’s placement in an unregistered unit. Paragraph 21 of the Guidance provides that if registration is refused or the applications for registration are withdrawn, the local authority should advise the court as a matter of urgency. It further provides that the court will take this into account when deciding whether the placement of the child in the unregistered children’s home continues to be in the child’s best interests. It is unnecessary to envisage all the sorts of factual situations that might arise which would still call for an order authorising a placement where the children’s home remains unregistered except to say that the test of necessity should be applied all the more strictly and that there will be a heightened level of anxious enquiry and scrutiny. In any event, the Guidance primarily envisages that the children’s home will become registered so that a criminal offence is no longer being committed by others. The Guidance must be followed so that, in practice, within a short period of time the children’s home is registered. This process of registration should continue to be energetically and pro-actively monitored by the courts.”</span></p>

It is to such placements that the President's Guidance, which was seen as central to the legal context by the Supreme Court, is addressed. The judgments in Re T endorse the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction to authorise deprivation of liberty with respect to a placement in an unregistered children's home, where imperative conditions of necessity justify doing so and there is no alternative available.</span></p>

The Supreme Court has held that the exercise of the jurisdiction of the High Court in these cases is lawful under the common law. The exercise of the jurisdiction is therefore 'prescribed by law' and an order made by the High Court authorising DOL is a 'lawful order' of the type required by Art 5(1)(d).

Section 23 and the regulations made thereunder are concerned with placements made by local authority with foster-parents and others: s 38 is not dealing with that issue at all. It is providing for the assessment of the child for the purpose of assisting the court in its assessment of the child’s best interests.

The child is in the care of the local authority under an interim care order pending the decision by the court whether or not to make a final care order. Under the interim care order the decision-making power as to the care, residence and general welfare of the child is vested in the local authority, not in the court. However, for the purpose of making its ultimate decision whether to grant a full care order, the court will need the help of social workers, doctors and others as to the child and his circumstances … Section 38(6) deals with the interaction between the powers of the local authority entitled to make decisions as to the child’s welfare in the interim and the needs of the court to have access to the relevant information and assessments so as to be able to make the ultimate decision. </span></p>

The cases where, despite that overall control, the court is to have power to intervene are set out, inter alia, in s 38(6) and (7). The purpose of s 38(6) is to enable the court to obtain the information necessary for its own decision, notwithstanding the control over the child which in all other respects rests with the local authority. I therefore approach the subsection on the basis that the court is to have such powers to override the views of the local authority as are necessary to enable the court to discharge properly its function of deciding whether or not to accede to the local authority’s application to take the child away from its parents by obtaining a care order. To allow the local authority to decide what evidence is to go before the court at the final hearing would be in many cases, including the present, to allow the local authority by administrative decision to pre-empt the court’s judicial decision.”</span></p>

The conditions under which such placement can be made are further regulated by regulations made by the Secretary of State. I do not accept this submission. Section 23 and the regulations made thereunder are concerned with placements made by local authority with foster-parents and others: s 38 is not dealing with that issue at all. It is providing for the assessment of the child for the purpose of assisting the court in its assessment of the child’s best interests. An order specifying where and with whom that assessment is to take place is not ‘a placement’ within s 23 at all.”</span></p>

It is fundamental that, apart from a “medical or psychiatric examination”, all the court can authorise or direct under section 38(6) is something that can properly be described as an “assessment” and, moreover, an assessment “of the child”. Hence, the need for the primary focus to be on the child, and hence, also, the familiar distinction between an “assessment” of the child (which is permissible) and a programme of therapy or treatment for the parent (which is not). </span></p>

I recognise, of course, that that principle will not always be easy to apply. The antithesis between assessment on the one hand and therapy and treatment on the other is at best an imperfect one. Essentially, however, as Thorpe LJ has explained, the court will be concerned to determine what is the primary purpose of the programme proposed and whether the element of therapy treatment can properly be regarded as merely ancillary to it.”</span></p>

In the first place, although, perhaps because they are the most protracted and expensive and most likely to cut across a local authority’s planning, and thus most likely to be controversial, we tend to think of section 38(6) assessments in terms of residential assessments in the kind of institutional settings of which the Cassell is a well-known example, section 38(6) is much wider and more general in its scope. It applies to any “examination” (medical or psychiatric) or any “assessment”, whether short or long, and in whatever setting. Secondly, subject only to the requirement that the assessment be “of the child”, section 38(6) is not expressed as imposing any restrictions at all on what can be directed by the court. The court can direct any “assessment of the child.” The only further restriction is that suggested by Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s reference in Re C to the purpose of section 38(6) as being “to enable the court to obtain the information necessary for its own decision … to enable it to reach a proper decision at the final hearing of the application for a full care order.” But those words, far from narrowing the scope of section 38(6) merely serve, as it seems to me, to bring out and emphasise the potential breadth of its ambit.</span></p>

Moreover, in carefully directing themselves that “The court requires evidence of how A settled in with aunt and grandmother before it will make a Special Guardianship Order”, the Justices were, in my judgment, acting properly in accordance with the approach set out in Re C. </span></p>

It involves reading into section 38(6) words of restriction which are simply not there – hardly surprisingly, perhaps, since the 1989 Act long predated the legislation ... And it involves limitations on the scope of section 38(6) which, in my judgment, would cut across the statutory purpose as explained by Lord Browne-Wilkinson in Re R and, indeed, might well prevent many illuminating and forensically useful assessments of the kind envisaged by their Lordships in Re G. </span></p>

The first is that the setting is unregulated and thus potentially unsafe. The response to this is that provided by Mr Jonathan-Jones: the setting is not unregulated; it is regulated by the court. The court, as I have said, will first have assured itself both that a section 38(6) assessment is appropriate on the facts of the particular case and, importantly, that the particular assessment envisaged is not merely appropriate but safe. And the court will no doubt take steps to ensure that the assessment is appropriately monitored or supervised as it proceeds – as it was in the present case, for, after all, the very purpose of what the Justices directed was that A should be observed in the family setting by both the guardian and the social worker.</span></p>

At first, R and his mother were accommodated for a short period pursuant to the mother’s agreement under s20 of the Act. No one has sought to raise any issues about this and I have not heard any submissions on this issue. I consider  this to fall outside the remit of this judgment. A<span style="font-style:italic">s</span> the position of each of the parties has crystalised, the provisions of  s38(6) of the Act have gained greater prevalence. For entirely correct reasons, it is common ground that the placement is a residential family centre that falls within the definition of the 2004 Act. As such it must be registered with Ofsted. The principal issue is whether the court can sanction the placement of the families in the face of noncompliance with the statutory requirements.</p>

The authorities that are cited above are but a limited number of examples of circumstances in which this jurisdiction has been utilised.  The Supreme Court’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re T</span> and subsequent cases such as <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A Mother v. Derby City Council</span> clearly illustrate the court’s jurisdiction being invoked to protect some of the most venerable children in our society. It is not surprising that at first the local authority in these two instant case sought to follow an analogous path as set out in the two aforementioned authorities.  However, this jurisdiction is not without limits and in this instance the combination of two important statutory provisions, namely s100(3) and s38(6) of the Act  make an insurmountable prohibition on the use of the court’s inherent jurisdiction. This prohibition is further fortified by PD12D. It follows that in the face of the available statutory means through which such a placement may be directed, the use of the court’s inherent jurisdiction is inappropriate. </p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.64in">At first blush these concerns are entirely logical and well placed in the circumstances that may be said that the two statutory regimes may be potentially in conflict. However, in my judgment such an approach is fundamentally flawed and unsustainable. Whilst not a commercial placement, this point was addressed head on in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">A (A Child), Re [2009</span><span style="font-style:italic">]</span> EWHC 865 (Fam). The terms of s38(6) provide for  one of the few examples where the court can interfere with the local authority’s exercise of its parental responsibility  under the terms of an Interim Care Order. Indeed these are squarely within the circumstances that Lord Browne-Wilkinson in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Re C</span>  saw as in <span style="font-style:italic">“in the interest of justice” </span>for the court to retain such a power. The purpose of making such a directions under the said provisions, is to enable the court to have available the necessary information to make a decision on what best serves the subject child’s welfare. Furthermore, although the said authority was concerned with the Welsh Regulations, the assessment of the courts powers as set out in paragraph 63 of the said judgment is clear and has equal application to the two cases before me. Therefore, as a matter of law and policy it is an essential part of the courts function and duties to be able to direct such assessments in settings that are judged to be appropriate for the relevant child and necessary to inform the outcome of the case.</p>

Latterly, the arguments as to whether the current placement falls within the ambit of these provisions have not been pursued with great zest. However, for completeness, given authorities that I have cited above, in my judgment this placement is clearly a residential placement whose function in assessing the children is part fulfilled  and in other parts are ancillary to the fulfilment of the assessment of each of these children. Therefore it falls well within the ambit of s38(6).There is no dispute between the parties that each of these families should be the subject of a residential assessment and without hesitation I endorse this accord which is founded in the premise of necessity to provide the court with important and essential information to be able to make decisions about the welfare of each of these children.</p>

The parties and the court must be given the appropriate information to understand the purpose and length of any proposed assessment.  If such a placement is to assess the relevant child, such a placement may be directed pursuant to s38(6) of the Act and the use of the court’s inherent jurisdiction is not appropriate regardless of the placement’s registration status. The provisions of s38(6) are one of the limited circumstances in which the court may interfere with the local authority’s exercise of parental responsibility for a child who is the subject of an interim care order. Its provisions are widely construed and are not limited to residential settings. They include medical or psychiatric assessment of the child as well as other elements of assessment that are ancillary to the primary assessment of the child.</p>
