          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This is an appeal brought with the permission of Swift J against his order of Friday, 10 June 2022, refusing interim relief, in particular to prevent the removal of the individual claimants from the United Kingdom ("UK") to Rwanda, pursuant to the well-known scheme which has been agreed between the Governments of the two countries.  The reason for the urgency in the case is that a flight is due to take place on the evening of tomorrow, 14 June, with the first group of individuals who are to be removed to Rwanda.  At one time there were 37 people to be removed on that flight but, at the hearing this morning we were informed that there are 11.  They include the Fifth Appellant but no longer include the Fourth.  They were the Ninth and Tenth Claimants in the High Court proceedings.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">We are grateful to all concerned, including the legal teams and court staff, for their hard work, in particular over the weekend, which has enabled this hearing to take place today speedily and efficiently.  In particular we are grateful to Mr Raza Husain QC, who made oral submissions for the Appellants, Ms Laura Dubinsky QC, who made submissions for the Intervener, the UNHCR, and Mr Rory Dunlop QC, who made submissions for the Respondent.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Because of the urgency in this case, it has not been possible to obtain an approved transcript of the judgment below.  The Court and the parties have, however, been provided with a note of his judgment by the judge, for which we are grateful.  The parties have had the opportunity to draw our attention to any errors or deficiencies that there may have been in that note but none has been suggested that is material.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before we address the specific issues which arise on this appeal, we should emphasise certain fundamentals about our system of justice.  While the underlying issues concerning removal of some asylum claimants to Rwanda are the subject of much public interest and ethical and political controversy, the courts cannot enter those debates.  The merits of the underlying policy are not a matter for the courts: the Government is accountable to Parliament for the merits of its policies.  The courts have the important, but limited, function of deciding only whether governmental action is lawful or not.  Furthermore, the question of the lawfulness of the scheme is not before us today and will be considered by the High Court in July.  </p>

        <paragraph eId="para_6">

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Moreover, as will become apparent, the role of this Court is not the same as the role of the High Court.  We do not sit to hear the case again or to substitute our own views for that of the judge.  As is common ground, our role, as an appellate court, is a more limited one, especially as the decision which the judge took to refuse interim relief was one in which he was exercising a discretion.  In particular, we shall have to consider whether the judge erred in principle and, even if he did not, whether his decision was one which was not reasonably open to him on the material before him.</p>
          </content>

        <paragraph eId="para_7">
          <num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;text-decoration-line:none;font-size:12pt;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.5in">7.</num>
          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The First Appellant, which was the Fifth Claimant below, the Public and Commercial Services Union ("PCSU"), is the largest trade union representing civil servants and represents around 80 per cent of Border Force Officials who are charged with implementing the scheme.  The Second and Third Appellants, who were the Sixth and Seventh Claimants below, are both charities.  Detention Action provides support to people in immigration detention and campaigns for detention reform; it is interested in this case because the scheme envisages that detention powers will be used to hold persons pending their removal to Rwanda.  Care 4 Calais provides frontline humanitarian support to refugees. </p>

There is a Memorandum of Understanding ("MOU") made between the United Kingdom and the Republic of Rwanda.  That agreement was made on 13 April 2022 and published on 14 April 2022.  The document records arrangements made for the transfer of persons, and responsibilities accepted by the United Kingdom and the Republic of Rwanda, respectively.  The MOU also sets out the arrangements for a Monitoring Committee which will monitor implementation of and compliance with the arrangements, and report.  The MOU is supplemented by two Notes Verbales: one addressing the asylum process in Rwanda; the other concerning the practical support to be provided to persons awaiting decisions on asylum claims, and to be provided to them after those decisions have been taken (both if the claim is accepted, and if it is refused). </span></p>

Schedule 3 contains provisions about the removal of persons claiming asylum to 'countries known to protect refugees and respect human rights'.  Absent Schedule 3, the operative provision is section 77 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 ("the 2002 Act").  That prevents the removal from the United Kingdom of a person who has an asylum claim pending.  Schedule 3 to the 2004 Act contains four distinct schemes that provide exceptions to the default provision in section 77 of the 2002 Act.  Persons who have made asylum claims that have yet to be determined may be removed under any of these exceptions.  The premise of these exceptions is that the person concerned will then be able to pursue an asylum claim in the country to which he has been removed.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.98in;margin-right:1.02in">Part Two of Schedule 3 to the 2004 Act prescribes a list of countries (all EU or EEA states) and provides that each is to be treated as a country in which a person would not be at risk of ill-treatment on any Refugee Convention ground; would not be sent to another country in breach of the Refugee Convention; and would not be sent to another country in breach of ECHR rights.  Asylum claimants can be removed to such countries so long the Secretary of State certifies the person concerned is not a national of the country concerned.  Part Two is not an issue in these proceedings; Rwanda is not on the list of states.  Parts Three and Four of Schedule 3 permit the Secretary of State to make orders specifying states.  If an order is made, the state concerned is to be treated as being one in which a person would not be a risk of ill-treatment on any Refugee Convention ground; and would not be sent to another country in breach of the Refugee Convention.  Neither Part 3 nor Part 4 is material for present purposes; no such order has been made in respect of Rwanda.</p>

By paragraph 17, the Secretary of State has the power to certify that she proposes to remove a person to a specified state; that the person is not a national of that state; and that it is her opinion that the specified state is a place where the person would not be at risk of ill-treatment on any Refugee Convention ground or be sent to any other country in breach of the Convention.  If the Secretary of State has so certified, paragraph 18 of Schedule 3 disapplies section 77 of the 2002 Act so that the person concerned may be removed from the United Kingdom notwithstanding an extant asylum claim.  The paragraph 17 power is the power that has been exercised in respect of each of the individual Claimants and is the power that is the legal premise for the Secretary of State's policy to remove certain asylum seekers from the United Kingdom to Rwanda.</p>

Importantly, the judge considered that the legality of the individual removal decisions was the operative matters for these proceedings, not the general decision of the Secretary of State to remove asylum claimants to Rwanda (see paragraphs 5 to 13 of his judgment, in particular the conclusion at paragraph 9). </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">The judge considered that there was a serious issue to be tried on grounds 1, 2, 3 and 5. Accordingly, he went on to consider whether the balance of convenience for an interim period, unlikely to extend far beyond July 2022, favoured or did not favour the grant of interim relief and held that it favoured neither the granting of the generic order sought against all removals without consent to Rwanda nor an order preventing the removal of the individual claimants.  The judge recognised that removal to Rwanda would be "arduous" and "distressing" for the individual claimants and that material matters of personal prejudice to each claimant would arise on removal.  In parentheses, we should observe that the note of the judgment taken by those acting for the Appellants recorded that the judge used the word "onerous" but, as Mr Husain rightly acknowledged, there is no material difference between the words "arduous" and "onerous" in this context.  However, the judge held that any prejudice to the claimants was outweighed by the prejudice which an order preventing removals would cause to the public interest in the Secretary of State being able to implement immigration control decisions, even for a short interim period. </p>

The judge set out his reasoning on this point by close reference to the relevant statutory provisions at paragraphs 10 to 13 of his judgment with the conclusion that the premise for the operation of the policy on removal to Rwanda was, first, that the person falls within one or other of the categories specified at paragraph 345A of the Immigration Rules, most likely subparagraph (iii)(b), and, second, that being so, Rwanda is a safe country that agrees to a person's entry for the purposes of paragraph 345C of the Rules. </p>

The two questions were whether the Claimants' grounds of challenge gave rise to one or more serious triable issues and, if they did, that the grant of relief will depend on the "balance of convenience", which he chose to describe more precisely as "which course of action pending the final hearing of the claim for judicial review gives rise to the least risk of prejudice if it turns out to be the wrong course of action."  In assessing what the judge called "the balance of prejudice" at paragraph 15, he said that he was bound to take account of the interests of the Fourth and Fifth Appellants and the general public interest that a public authority be permitted to apply a policy or continue to act to exercise its statutory powers when acting in the public interest. </p>

Mr Husain submits that the judge made a fundamental legal error in holding that a generally applicable assessment or decision, which judicial review ground 1 targets, cannot be challenged by way of judicial review when not "operative" in an individual's case.  If correct, then it would follow that policies would not be amenable to judicial review at all.

First, any issue taken as to the standing of the First to Third Appellants is not an issue at this hearing.  Second, the evidence on irremediable harm in this case applies "across the board" to every decision made pursuant to the scheme and is, in Mr Husain's submission, enough to show a real risk of Article 3 harm.  Potential further prejudice to groups not before the Court, who may be gay or disabled, makes the case even more compelling.  Third, the type of general interim relief order sought is one commonly made in charter flight cases and Mr Husain relies on a number of examples of such orders which the Court has made in other unrelated cases.</p>

This, he says, favours the grant of general interim relief in favour of all individuals who have not consented to their removal to Rwanda.  At the hearing before us Mr Husain made it clear that his submission is confined to all the 11 people who are due to be removed on tomorrow's flight and does not include anyone who may be removed to Rwanda in the next few weeks before the substantive hearing in the High Court.  Nevertheless, as Mr Dunlop observed on behalf of the Respondent, it would be unrealistic to think that, if this Court grants generic interim relief in relation to the flight tomorrow, other flights could take place before the High Court hearing.  </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Addressing the first ground of appeal, Ms Dubinsky reiterates the submissions made before the judge that the UNHCR warns that there is a real risk of indirect <span style="font-style:italic">refoulement</span> if asylum seekers are removed from the UK to Rwanda.  The UNHCR has concerns about the fairness and capacity of the refugee status determination process which cannot be rectified at speed.  Ms Dubinsky also submits that persons relocated to Rwanda may be at risk of detention and treatment not in accordance with international standards should they protest against their conditions after arrival.</p>

Further, the intentions expressed in the documents do not remove the real risk of what, the UNHCR submits, are three distinct forms of <span style="font-style:italic">refoulement</span>: pre-emptory <span style="font-style:italic">refoulement</span>, constructive <span style="font-style:italic">refoulement </span>or, as she put it at the hearing before us <span style="font-style:italic">de facto refoulement</span>, and <span style="font-style:italic">de jure</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">refoulement</span>. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">In relation to the first ground of appeal, Mr Dunlop advances five "answers" to the alleged errors in the judge's conclusions about the first stage of the judge's assessment on the serious issues to be tried.  First, he submits that this ground does not identify any error of principle.  It is in essence a submission that the judge should have given greater weight to the likelihood of the claim succeeding as it was "compelling".  Any difference between the judge's assessment that there was a serious issue and the contentions about a compelling case are not material.  In any event, this Court should not, Mr Dunlop argues, substitute its views on the strengths of the grounds of the claim. </p>

For example, later material from the UNHCR can be taken into account by officials making case-by-case decisions and the Secretary of State is well-placed to assess the likelihood of Rwanda complying with the Notes Verbales.

Moreover, there is no tension between the conclusions on the interim risk of <span style="font-style:italic">refoulement</span> and ground 1 of the claim.

The judge was correct to point out that the premise that an error in the general assessment of Rwanda would vitiate all decisions was wrong for the reasons given at paragraph 28.

The risk arises from the inevitable fact that a court cannot deal with the final merits of litigation early on and yet it may be necessary to grant a remedy in the meantime while the parties prepare their cases.  It may turn out at the end of the day that the court has granted or refused a remedy which a party was or was not entitled to.</p>

I do not consider that these alleged failings and the judge's treatment of the evidence are such as would entitle an appeal court to intervene.

In view of the urgency it has not been possible for the usual steps to be taken, for example, the filing of summary grounds of resistance.  The judge ordered there to be a rolled-up hearing before the end of July, by which time the Respondent will have had the opportunity to file detailed evidence.  It is not for us to anticipate what the High Court will finally decide after the substantive hearing after it has been able to assess all of the evidence in the round.  Although Mr Husain submitted in his reply before us that public law grounds are inherently grounds of law, it is often the case that they turn on detailed assessment of evidence.  In the present case, we consider that will be true, for example in relation to the capacity of Rwanda to cope with asylum claims; the provision of interpreters and legal advice and so on.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">The starting point for the judge’s assessment was that the interim period would be relatively short, about six or seven weeks, until around the end of July.  He was right to take that view.  We do not accept the submission that the judge was obliged to take into account the possibility of appeals and further delay after the judgment of the High Court has been given after the substantive hearing.  The hypothesis for the Appellants' case must be that they will succeed at the substantive hearing.  On that basis, as the judge noted, the individual claimant would, on his own case, be entitled to be returned to the UK.  If there were then an appeal, as the judge observed, it would be a matter for the appellate court to determine what the next steps should be, for example whether any interim relief should be granted pending an appeal.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Given therefore that the interim period would be relatively short, the judge was entitled to take the view that it was unlikely that the individual claimants before him would be improperly returned to another state by the Rwandan authorities in that timeframe.

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Furthermore, in that context, the judge was entitled to give weight to the MOU and Notes Verbales.  They may not be legally enforceable, even as a matter of international law, but they are formal agreements between sovereign states.  The UK will expect Rwanda to comply with them and the Rwandan authorities will know that their conduct will be under scrutiny in the particular context of people who have been removed there by the UK pursuant to the arrangements between the two countries.  The judge did not need to be sure, as has been submitted, that the MOU would be implemented.  This was something to which he was entitled to give weight.

He considered their views but was not bound to follow them.  The fact is that, in the context of the relatively short interim period which the judge was considering, the evidence for the UNHCR did not lead to the conclusion that it was likely that an individual claimant would be improperly returned to another state without proper consideration of their asylum claim in Rwanda in the brief interim period.  There simply would not be time for all of those steps to be taken, especially in the circumstances we have already ready described above, in which the MOU and Notes Verbales are in place.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.39in">In those circumstances, since the only individual claimant now before us cannot obtain interim relief, it is strictly unnecessary to consider Ground 3.  In any event, we agree with the judge that applications for interim relief in this context must be considered on an individual basis and not a generic basis.  Otherwise, the Respondent could be prevented from implementing her policy of removal even in a case in which there is no legal defect in the individual decision-making process at all.  </p>
