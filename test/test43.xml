              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">An apparent issue was the grounds of appeal for each of the appellants.

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In the second appellant’s case despite numerous attempts by HMRC, it appeared that it had not been possible to locate a full copy of the grounds of appeal as originally lodged. The amended grounds of appeal were identical to the second grounds of appeal for the first appellant. In correspondence it seemed that it had been Mr Kamal’s intention to replace those with amended grounds, as in the case of the first appellant, but, for whatever reason, that did not happen. Mr Kamal lodged amended grounds of appeal for the third appellant.</p>

                  <p style="margin-left:1.08in">The best approach from a judge is to base factual findings on inferences drawn from documentary evidence and known or probable facts.  “This does not mean that oral testimony serves no useful purpose …   Buts its value lies largely … in the opportunity which cross-examination affords to subject the documentary record to critical scrutiny and to gauge the personality, motivations and working practices of a witness, rather than in testimony of what the witness recalls of particular conversations and events.  Above all, it is important to avoid the fallacy of supposing that, because a witness has confidence in his or her recollection and is honest, evidence based on that recollection provides any reliable guide to the truth”.</p>

Thus the court should hesitate about making a final decision without a trial, even where there is no obvious conflict of fact at the time of the application, where reasonable grounds exist for believing that a fuller investigation into the facts of the case would add to or alter the evidence available to a trial judge and so affect the outcome of the case: Doncaster Pharmaceuticals Group Ltd v Bolton Pharmaceutical Co 100 Ltd [2007] FSR 63;</span></p>

The reason is quite simple: if the respondent's case is bad in law, he will in truth have no real prospect of succeeding on his claim or successfully defending the claim against him, as the case may be. Similarly, if the applicant's case is bad in law, the sooner that is determined, the better. If it is possible to show by evidence that although material in the form of documents or oral evidence that would put the documents in another light is not currently before the court, such material is likely to exist and can be expected to be available at trial, it would be wrong to give summary judgment because there would be a real, as opposed to a fanciful, prospect of success. However, it is not enough simply to argue that the case should be allowed to go to trial because something may turn up which would have a bearing on the question of construction: ICI Chemicals &amp; Polymers Ltd v TTE Training Ltd [2007] EWCA Civ 725."</span></p>
