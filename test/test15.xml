              <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="text-indent:0.5in">This appeal concerns the interpretation and application of the “mixed partnership” rules contained in sections 850C to 850E of the Income Tax (Trading and Other Income) Act 2005 (“ITTOIA”). A mixed partnership arises where a partnership includes at least one individual partner and one non-individual partner, such as a limited company or other corporate entity.  </p>

            <content>
              <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="text-indent:0.5in">The partnership rules include section 850C. One effect of this provision is to enable the Commissioners for Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”) to increase the profit share of an individual partner who has the power to enjoy the profit share of the corporate partner, if other conditions are satisfied. In these circumstances, HMRC is required to reallocate so much of the profit share of the corporate partner to the individual partner’s power to enjoy to the extent this is just and reasonable.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>The purpose of the rule is to prevent individual partners making arrangements which seek to accumulate profits in a corporate partner at a lower tax rate – for example, benefitting from the rate of corporation tax which is lower than the higher or additional rate of income tax.</p>

              <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="text-indent:0.5in">In this case, Mr Walewski (or the “Appellant”) and Walewski Limited (“W Ltd”) were both partners in two LLP partnerships: Alken Asset Management LLP (“AAM”) and Alken Finance LLP (“AF”). The Appellant was an individual partner and W Ltd was a non-individual or corporate partner. W Ltd was a UK company of which the Appellant was a sole director and employee. Partners of the LLPs in this case are also referred to as members.</p>

              <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="text-indent:0.5in">The Appellant appealed the amendments in the closure notices to the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”). He contended that the additional profits of the two partnerships, amounting to £19,460,705, should not be re-allocated to him because they were earned by W Ltd as a corporate partner and not by him in his capacity as an individual partner in AAM or AF. The majority of these profits were allocated to W Ltd from AAM. The remaining, much smaller amount (£1,372,510), was allocated to W Ltd from AF.</p>

            <content>
              <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="text-indent:0.5in">The FTT dismissed the Appellant’s appeal in a decision released on 30 January 2020.  An amended decision was released on 21 April 2020 (the “Decision”). The FTT found that the profit share from the partnerships was not earned by W Ltd but was allocated to W Ltd because of the Appellant’s ability to enjoy those profits via an offshore trust to which W Ltd paid its profits and of which the Appellant’s children were beneficiaries. It found that the whole of W Ltd’s profit share was attributable to the Appellant’s power to enjoy its profits and that it was just and reasonable to reallocate all of W Ltd’s profits to the Appellant.</p>

            <content>
              <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="text-indent:0.5in">The Appellant sought to appeal the Decision to the Upper Tribunal on two grounds. On 21 April 2020, the FTT granted the Appellant permission to appeal on the first ground of appeal. On 22 May 2020 the Upper Tribunal granted the Appellant permission to appeal on the second ground.</p>

            <content>
              <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="text-indent:0.5in">The first ground of appeal (“Ground 1”) is that, to the extent W Ltd’s profit share was attributable to the period of time when the Appellant was not a partner of AAM (which was between August and November 2014), the profits could not have been reallocated to him. It was submitted that the FTT erred in finding that section 850C ITTOIA could apply to such a time period.</p>

            <content>
              <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="text-indent:0.5in">The second ground of appeal (“Ground 2”) is premised on the FTT’s findings at [170] to [172] of the Decision that the Appellant’s work for W Ltd, AAM and AF was fungible, he was playing only a single role for the benefit of all three entities, and there was “no commercial, physical or temporal separation of [the Appellant’s] activities”. The Appellant submits that the inevitable consequence of these findings is that the FTT erred in allocating all of W Ltd’s profits to the Appellant for the relevant period. There should have been an equal division of W Ltd’s profits (excluding the amounts which could not be reallocated in any case).</p>

            <content>
              <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="text-indent:0.5in">We consider these grounds of appeal in turn below, in Sections D and E. Before we do so, however, it is necessary to set out the relevant statutory provisions (which we do in Section B) and explain how those provisions were applied by HMRC and found to apply by the FTT (which we do in Section C). In a number of respects, the Appellant accepted the approach of HMRC as considered by the FTT (or at least did not seek to appeal the FTT’s decision in these respects), but it is nevertheless necessary to understand the overall approach in order properly to understand Ground 1 and Ground 2.</p>

The Decision sets out detailed findings of fact and conclusions based on those findings. In this section, we set out the background facts (as found by the FTT) in Section C(2), before proceeding to set out (in Section C(3)) – in a slightly clearer form than the statute – the conditions that needed to be met in order for section 850C(4) ITTOIA to bite. Thereafter, we set out – very briefly – the FTT’s conclusions as to the assessments and the application of section 850C(4). We do so briefly because the FTT’s Decision is challenged only on the basis of Ground 1 and Ground 2, and these are the only matters before us. We consider the Decision more generally only in order to provide the context for the consideration of Grounds 1 and 2.</p>

Section 850C envisages cases where individual partners divert their share of profits arising from an LLP to a partner that is a company, and this is relevant because an individual cannot divert that which he does not have to divert in the first place. In other words, to the extent that W Ltd’s profit share relates to the period when the Appellant was not a member of AAM, the profits were those of the then member (i.e. excluding the Appellant) and thus they could not have been diverted by the Appellant to W Ltd. The FTT should either have held (a) that the legislation simply did not apply to such profits, or alternatively (b) that such profits could not be reallocated pursuant to section 850C(4).”</span></p>

Section 850A applies for a “period of account”. It is therefore consistent for section 850C to apply for that same period of account, in this case from 6 April 2014 until the dissolution of the partnership on 29 November 2014.</p>

This, as it seems to us, is an impermissible attempt to argue primary points of discretion, and absent a contention that the FTT erred as a matter of law, the FTT’s Decision must stand. Having rejected the error of law contended for by the Appellant – namely that the FTT had misconstrued section 850C in the manner we have described – we consider that the Appellant has not articulated, in Ground 1, any further basis for contending that the FTT had erred as a matter of law.</p>

              <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="text-indent:0.5in">On behalf of the Appellant it was submitted that, given that the FTT found the Appellant was playing a single role for the benefit of all three entities, it had accepted that the Appellant was providing half of his time or half of his services through W Ltd to the partnerships and their clients. W Ltd had, therefore, earned that half of its profit share from the partnerships as a corporate partner. The increase in the Appellant’s profit share should take account of the time and services the Appellant provided through W Ltd to the partnerships and their clients.</p>

              <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="text-indent:0.5in">We confess that we have some difficulty in seeing the error of law alleged by the Appellant in Ground 2. It is trite that the terms of a decision or judgment should not be read as if a statute, and – particularly where an appeal is confined to points of law – an appellate court must be particularly careful when considering the manner in which the court below has expressed itself. Here, quite clearly, the FTT was holding that the manner in which Mr Walewski provided his services was utterly fluid and essentially unknowable. The fact is that W Ltd was nothing more than a corporate <span style="font-style:italic">alter ego</span> to Mr Walewski and it seems to us that the conclusion reached by the FTT is entirely consistent with that finding. </p>

              <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="text-indent:0.5in">In short, we are satisfied that Ground 2 is nothing more than a challenge either to the factual findings of the FTT as to whether the statutory requirements were satisfied or to its determination as to what was “just and reasonable” on the facts it had found. Neither, as it seems to us, can amount to an error of law, whether as articulated in Ground 2 or otherwise.</p>

              <p class="Bodytexttax1" style="text-indent:0.5in">The FTT properly and carefully followed each stage in the series of statutory requirements imposed by section 850C and, where in dispute, made findings that these statutory requirements were satisfied. Its findings on each requirement, including on the extent of W Ltd’s excess profits, were rational and available to it to make on the evidence it received. We are satisfied that the findings were neither perverse nor irrational. There is no sustainable challenge that can be made to any of the factual findings or inferences that could be drawn from them.  </p>
