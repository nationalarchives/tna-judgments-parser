            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This judgment follows a finding of fact hearing in public family law proceedings brought by a London Local Authority in respect of LB, a boy born in November 2020. LB’s mother, the first respondent, KB, has moderate to severe learning disability having suffered hypoxia at birth. She is non-verbal, she lacks capacity to make decisions about engaging in sexual relations or to consent to sexual intercourse, and she is fully dependent on others for her care. Her pregnancy with LB was the result of her rape by GH in late February or early March 2020. At that time KB was being cared for within her family which comprised her mother, AB, her sister CD, and her brother EF. GH had married AB in a religious ceremony in or about 2013. They had lived together until in or around 2017 when GH moved out into his own accommodation. Nevertheless, they stayed married and he continued to visit AB at her home and to help out with cleaning, shopping and ironing. GH has admitted the rape and although the details of the offence are unclear, GH says that he committed the rape when at AB’s home. The anonymity of the Local Authority and all individuals concerned, including GH, is preserved to protect the identity of KB, who is a highly vulnerable woman, and LB, her child. The circumstances of the case are such that naming GH, the Local Authority or any members of KB’s family would be likely to lead to the identification of KB and LB.</p>

          <intro>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">AB described GH to police as one of KB’s paid carers. KB’s pregnancy was not detected until over 22 weeks gestation. Therefore, serious questions arise as to the arrangements for protecting and caring for KB. The Local Authority’s position is that AB and CD not only failed to protect KB but that they, and to an extent EF,  exploited her for their own interests. The Local Authority’s allegations are set out in the Scott Schedule at Appendix One to this judgment. The Local Authority alleges, in short, that:</p>

She has two younger siblings, CD, her sister, who is a healthcare professional, and EF, her brother, a teacher. They are both in their 20’s, unmarried and without children. The arrangements in February 2020 were that KB had a two bedroom flat (“the flat”) where she stayed overnight with CD. The flat was rented in KB’s name. She would visit a Day Centre three times a week. A carer, JK, would help to get her ready in the mornings. JK was a woman who had the same African heritage and spoke the same African language as the family. AB would drive KB to the Day Centre. After the Day Centre, KB would return to AB’s home before being taken to the flat once CD had come home from work. Sometimes KB would stay overnight at AB’s home. There had been longer periods, when CD was committed to a placement or study away from home, when KB stayed at the family home. When not at the Day Centre she would spend her weekdays with AB. At weekends she would spend time with CD. EF lived at AB’s home. He was not involved in the intimate care of KB, which would be done by AB, CD and/or JK.</p>

Dr Clarke was not present at that attendance but notes that “there was no request to facilitate termination of pregnancy at any time from the family or social care.” She first saw KB, in the company of AB,  on 27 August 2020 by which time KB was over 25 weeks pregnant.

There are other bundles including a bundle comprising documents found by the police on AB’s laptop. The volume of documentation is largely accounted for by the extensive police investigations including multiple interviews and interrogations of numerous mobile phone devices. I heard oral evidence from Dr Clarke, Consultant Obstetrician, a Senior Clinical Specialist Nurse, a Key Worker form the Day Centre, a GP from KB’s GP Practice, PC Gillam who was the officer in charge of the criminal investigation, Mr Canning, from the Office of the Public Guardian, JK, who was paid to care for KB, the allocated social worker, and from GH, AB, CD, and EF. GH attended remotely from prison throughout the hearing and screens in court were used when needed to protect members of KB’s family from seeing him whilst he gave evidence. When he was not giving evidence his camera was turned off. He required an interpreter. Unfortunately, partly because of difficulties with interpreters and the prison link, the evidence could not be concluded in the expected time and so an additional date for concluding the evidence had to be found. CD therefore gave her evidence some weeks later. Written submissions were then received and time had to be extended for their receipt due to the commitments of certain Counsel. </p>

In the absence of certain findings being made, the possibility of LB being cared for within the family would remain. AB, CD and EF have all put themselves forward as permanent carers for LB either by themselves or jointly with each other. </p>

He did not have a legal representative at hand and it cannot have been easy for him to prepare for the hearing given his incarceration and the volume of documents in the case. Nevertheless, his evidence was unfocused, inconsistent with much of the documentation and some of his out of court statements, and often incredible. His goal when giving evidence appeared to be to spread blame for events in this case to everyone except himself. I refer to some particular parts of his evidence which I reject in the remainder of this judgment. GH’s main case was that he was never employed as a carer or in receipt of any payments for caring for KB, that AB was a fraudster and that she had set him up in relation to sexual intercourse with KB - which he told the court happened during the day when AB left him alone with KB at the family home -  and that the whole family had abused the benefits system for their own financial advantage.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">AB was represented and able to attend court throughout the hearing, but I take into account the difficulty for her of answering detailed questions about a large volume of material and the stress involved in having to talk about her vulnerable daughter’s rape. Naturally, this was distressing for her and breaks were taken to allow her to recover her composure when that was required. Generally, however, she was composed and able to answer the questions from and on behalf of the other parties. She was angry about GH’s actions and his allegations against the family. She maintained that she had properly employed JK and GH as carers for KB but that GH was never involved in any personal care and that she had never allowed GH to spend any time alone with KB. She remained mystified as to how the rape could have occurred. Her sole interest had only ever been in KB’s best interests and she tried to remain positive at all times so as not to distress KB. She had founded the Church in which she remained heavily involved. She felt that Direct Payments should have been made to provide for 24 hour care for KB. She managed the Direct Payments properly with the help of an accountant. She wanted to be able to look after LB within the family. In many ways AB is an impressive woman who has provided care for KB within the family for over thirty years, as well as bringing up CD and EF largely alone, and who has founded and run the Church. However, whilst unfailingly courteous, she was frequently evasive in her evidence. She resisted scrutiny of her financial affairs and her dealings with GH and sought to justify conduct which could not be justified. Just as she had tried to hide her relationship with GH from authorities in the past, so she tried to conceal her dealings with him by failing to answer questions put to her at the hearing.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although the Local Authority did pay for some modest legal fees for CD and EF to receive advice, they were not legally represented at the hearing and had the difficult task of preparing their cases in a sensitive and document-heavy case largely without legal assistance. I pay tribute to the way they conducted themselves during the hearing, remaining dignified and courteous throughout. They understandably shared their mother’s hostility towards GH. I take into account that they too had the difficult task of answering questions related to their sister’s rape. Nevertheless, EF was often evasive when answering questions in cross-examination. He was reluctant to give direct answers and sometimes his evidence had to be extracted from him by repeated questioning. CD was more forthcoming and, I found, more open and honest during her evidence. Both CD and EF tended to be very defensive of their mother, trying too much to excuse her conduct. For example, AB had clearly not been open with the police and social services about her relationship with GH – she had not told the police that they were married and she had referred to him as KB’s uncle in discussions with a social worker – but CD and EF sought to excuse this by questioning the police officers’ attitude and saying that the term used by AB was an affectionate name for a senior male in a social group. That may be so, but it did not explain their mother’s failure to declare that he was her husband. Perhaps because CD was the last witness to give evidence and there was a long break before she gave her evidence on the last date of the hearing, she was more open than her mother and brother had been having had more time to reflect on the evidence previously given. She admitted that the proceedings had demonstrated that the family members had not known each other as well as they had assumed, that there had been compromises and that they needed now to ensure that things were done properly in relation to KB’s care. It appeared to me that CD accepted that AB had kept information from her and EF, for example about her relationship with GH. This was something to which EF had also alluded during his evidence, at least in relation to GH’s treatment of his mother. Whilst CD remained overly defensive of her mother, she answered questions directly, she became more open, and I found her generally to be a credible witness whose evidence was mostly consistent with the documentary and other evidence in the case.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Throughout the hearing I was struck by the genuine love and affection that CD and EF had for their sister, KB. EF has been less involved than CD in KB’s care, but his affection and willingness to support her was still strong. CD has built a career as a healthcare professional and whilst forging that career she has not had as much time as she would otherwise have enjoyed to be with and care for KB. However, she demonstrated a deep understanding of KB and a deep bond with her. AB too is obviously a loving mother but she has allowed her own sense of entitlement to lead her to dishonest and self-serving practices as I set out in my evaluation of the evidence below.</p>

The behaviour and evidence of AB, CD and EF has not always been conventional and I have had the particular advantage of seeing and hearing their oral evidence. There has been a lack of candour on the part of them and GH such that it has been difficult to discern the truth of what has happened in this case. I remind myself that the burden of proof lies with the party making an allegation and that the standard of proof is the civil standard of the balance of probabilities. Whilst, for convenience, I set out my evaluation of the evidence under sub-titles below, I have evaluated the evidence as a whole as a broad canvas. </p>

She can manage some basic tasks herself but needs prompting and requires assistance with many other basic activities of daily living. AB receives carer’s allowance. From when KB was about 19 years old, the Local Authority implemented a care plan which provided for 28.74 hours of care per week from personal assistants. This was to provide respite care for AB, it being expected that she would continue to provide care for KB herself. KB was also attending a Day Centre on three days a week. For some years AB received Direct Payments pursuant to a Direct Payments Agreement with the Local Authority. The agreement would be renewed annually but the material terms remained unchanged. In cross-examination AB was shown a copy of one such agreement which, she agreed, bore her signature. She told the court that she did not recognise the document or the terms.

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">JK would, as she told the court, pay some of the money she received from AB as recorded in her payslips, back to AB. The mechanism sometimes used was for JK to make payments to the Church account. This is but one example of financial transactions that give rise to serious concern that AB has used the Church account inappropriately. The amounts she paid back varied and there was no regular pattern of paybacks. I accept JK’s explanation that AB told her that these payments back to her represented remuneration to AB for the care she had provided to KB because JK was not working the number of hours represented on the payslips. JK accepted that her own pay was usually £250 per month, even though the payslips in her name were for over £400 per month. JK struck me as very trusting and naïve and I do not believe that she thought she was doing anything wrong. To her, AB was an authority figure and she did what she was told. Some of these payments back to AB are shown in bank statements, corroborating JK’s account. This arrangement was clearly contrary to the Direct Payments Agreement. It was, and I am satisfied that AB knew that it was, a means of diverting the direct payments to benefit her, AB. The Church account was porous in that payments were made to and from it via personal accounts for AB and other family members. I have no doubt that the monies paid by JK to the Church account were ultimately used for the benefit of AB. There are likely to have been other payments by JK to AB out of her initial payments from the DP account, that were made in cash or through other accounts, but I do not have a comprehensive set of statements to establish the extent of the payments. I reject AB’s evidence that the repayments were arranged due to JK working fewer hours than agreed. If that had been the case then the monthly payment would be reduced or adjusted accordingly, rather than a re-payment being demanded. Further, there would have been a credit within the Direct Payments accounts with excess funds available – but there is no evidence of such credits or excess funds. Her evidence conflicted with that of JK. I am sure that one of the motivations AB had for diverting Direct Payments was that she was providing a great deal of care to KB herself. AB may well have considered that she was entitled to payment for caring for KB in excess of the benefits she received, but the agreement was that the direct payments were for employed carers, not for her. By ensuring that some of the money purportedly paid to JK as a carer was diverted back to benefit her, AB acted dishonestly. She was, I am satisfied, aware of these arrangements because she effectively directed them, and, objectively viewed, they were dishonest. It follows that AB has not been honest with the court about these arrangements. I am sure that she has hidden the true position from the court in order to hide what she knows to have been wrongdoing.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">GH denies ever having received payments for caring for KB and so does not make any allegation that he made payments back to AB from the money received from her in the same way as JK. I am sure, notwithstanding his denials, that he did receive payments from AB for caring for KB. There is unambiguous evidence in the bank statements provided to the court of payments being made to him which correspond to the amounts recorded in the payslips. The hours of work for which AB paid GH, as recorded on the payslips and represented by the payments made to his account, were far in excess of the hours he spent doing minor chores for the benefit of AB and KB, such as shopping, ironing, and some domestic cleaning. From 2017 onwards he would visit the family home at weekends, so he was not providing anything more than occasional services, if any, on weekdays. All witnesses told the court that he was not involved in any personal care of KB. All he did was to help with some chores. Yet he was paid through the Direct Payments scheme for 60 hours’ work a month. Statements from one of GH’s bank accounts, in the name of KAS, shows that he withdrew £1,270 from cash points from that account in October 2019 alone [A77]. He clearly conducted many dealings in cash. He told the court that he did shopping for KB. There is no audit trail showing where the money came from to pay for the shopping. There are payments between accounts controlled by AB and accounts controlled by GH, including their joint account. I only have some statements from some accounts but the clear picture is of money passing to and from GH and AB on a frequent basis. It is highly likely, in my judgment, that money from the direct payments, intended to pay for KB’s care, was used by AB and GH for other purposes. </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">AB has consistently failed to disclose her true relationship with GH. She has said in these proceedings that they were married in a religious ceremony at the church at which she, and later, GH, were ministers in 2013 and there is no dispute about that. However, she wrote a “to whom it may concern letter” stating that she had known GP since he had attended a church service, since when “I began to know him more.” In two other “to whom it may concern” letters dated 14 and 18 February 2020 she writes as a pastor to confirm that GH had been in receipt of support from the Church as a Charitable Organisation for his “living expenses”. Again, there is no mention that they were married. She did not disclose their relationship to the Local Authority when she began to use Direct Payments to pay him for caring for KB. I have noted that the Direct Payments agreement required her to do so. She did not tell the police in interview the true nature of their relationship, giving the impression that he was a family friend and carer, not that they were married. She referred to him as “uncle” to KB’s social worker in August 2020 [F429]. CD and EF sought to explain to the court that “uncle” was a term of endearment to any senior male, but whilst I accept that AB was not intending to suggest that GH was KB’s uncle by relation, the use of the term obscured the true relationship between AB and GH which she neglected to mention. I am satisfied that the reason why AB failed to disclose her true relationship with GH to the social worker, to the Local Authority and to the police, is that she wanted to give the false impression that he was an unrelated, paid carer. In fact, she used the Direct Payments to pay money to him which she and GH then used for purposes other than for providing paid care for KB. As with the arrangements in relation to paybacks from JK,  AB was dishonest in her financial dealings regarding the use of Direct Payments purportedly for KB’s care by GH.</p>

Likewise, GH has sought to hide his financial benefit from the misuse of the Direct Payments in order to distance himself from what appears to be fraudulent activity.</p>

AB was very much in charge of those arrangements and there is no evidence that she discussed them with her children or involved them in the transactions. There are payments into the Church account by CD and EF, which they explained to be donations to the Church. They were not regular and I accept that they were genuine. There were payments out to CD and EF from the Church account but they explained their purposes - for example to cover expenses for a particular event - they were occasional and, again, I accept them to be genuine. The evidence does not persuade me that CD or EF were parties to any dishonest arrangements involving the Direct Payments. </p>

Documentary evidence shows that KB was recorded as a secretary of the Church with what purports to be her signature appearing on some Church documents as secretary. An application was completed to open a bank account in an African country with her name and signature appearing. There is also a typed letter in her name suggesting that EF would be living at KB’s home to assist in her care, again purportedly written by KB. She was incapable of understanding the meaning of the documents she was apparently signing or which purported to be in her name. What appears as her signature was, in each case, very probably written by someone else.</p>

During the course of the hearing I was concerned that the flat was never for KB’s use but was put in her name in order to provide accommodation for CD. However, I accept that KB did live there, albeit she spent a lot of time at the family home, particularly when CD was not around to look after her due to CD’s university or training commitments. AB, CD and EF thought it natural for agreements in relation to the flat to be in KB’s name. I accept that they simply did not think about whether, for example, a warranty should be in KB’s name, because, as they saw it, the flat was hers and so was the washing machine within it. As to the letter about EF living at the flat, purportedly written by KB, I accept that this letter was never sent to anyone. It was AB who wrote the letter, as she accepted. It would have misled a recipient into thinking that KB had written it, but it did not in fact mislead anyone or procure any financial advantage. It does however underline that AB can be casual with the truth.</p>

This is an example of AB misusing KB’s name. AB told the court that the application was not submitted. There is no other evidence on whether or not it was submitted. However, KB’s signature was on the document and she was, apparently, secretary of the charity for a period of time. AB is responsible for those matters. In my judgment it was expedient for AB to use KB as the secretary. It saved time and effort. However, it was plainly wrong to use KB’s name in this way.</p>

The family had instructed a solicitor to deal with this matter. The solicitor had signed section 9 of the LPA form as a witness to the signature of KB (whose name appears not as a signature but in capital letters both in section 9 and section 15). The certificate provider was a general medical practitioner who signed on 12 July 2018 certifying that the donor understood the purpose of the LPA and the scope of authority conferred under it and that they had discussed the LPA with the donor. Clearly they could not have discussed the LPA with KB without realising that she did not have the capacity to understand its purpose and scope. Further, the solicitor should have advised the family that KB did not have capacity to make the LPA. The GP has not been traced. She may have believed she was signing some other form of document. It is possible that she signed without reading. It has certainly not been established that her signature is a forgery.</p>

I note that, on making investigations, Mr Canning received no response from the solicitor involved in making the LPA nor from the GP who acted as the certificate provider (who, I should make clear, was not the GP who gave evidence at Court and is no longer a GP at his practice). The making of this LPA was clearly in error: it was invalid, and it has subsequently been removed from the register. However, I accept that the family were given erroneous advice that an LPA was the appropriate mechanism for managing KB’s property and affairs and that they followed that advice in good faith.</p>

She was KB’s carer for a lot of the time and had been throughout her childhood. KB appears to have been well cared for in terms of her physical health and wellbeing, her relationships within the family, and her emotional wellbeing. Had AB had any belief that GH might sexually abuse or rape KB there is no doubt that she would have taken steps to prevent him having any access to her. AB did not have any such belief.

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">KB cannot speak to the events in late February or early March 2020 when she was raped by GH – she does not have the capacity to do so. There is no evidence that she has ever alluded to the events. I have referred to GH’s accounts to the police in interview and to the Crown Court through his probation report. To this court he gave a new and different account. He said that AB had tricked him by leaving him alone with KB during the daytime having, as he said he believed, encouraged or coached KB to take off her clothes and go to him. AB had then returned after 20 minutes, earlier than expected, and found KB and GH having sexual intercourse. His evidence left me entirely unclear as to the motive AB would have for “tricking” him in this way. Moreover, it would be a curious plan by AB given that there was no history of KB being intimate with GH and, on GH’s account, AB was only gone for 20 minutes. How could she possibly have known that on return she would find KB and GH having sexual intercourse even if she had encouraged KB to go to GH naked? GH had not previously alleged that AB had played such a role, it would be wholly contrary to AB’s protectiveness and love of KB to do what GH alleged, and it is almost inconceivable that KB would be capable of following such an instruction. GH’s allegations were wholly incredible and very hurtful to KB’s family. By making such allegations GH showed, once more, his failure to take any responsibility for his actions. I reject without hesitation any suggestion that AB played any role in “setting up” a sexual encounter between KB and GH or that KB approached GH in a sexualised manner. Nothing in her previous or subsequent conduct has shown any sexualised behaviour or such disinhibition. </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">However, I am sure that what GH told me was truthful to this limited extent – he raped KB when AB was out of the house. At the time when the rape occurred GH would have had no opportunity to rape KB anywhere except inside the family home. In my judgement, it is most unlikely that the rape took place when someone else was in the family home. GH is unlikely to have taken the risk of being discovered raping KB with someone else in the house. On the evidence I have received, KB is unlikely to have been silent in the circumstances which would have been foreign to her and therefore likely to distress her. The layout of the house is such that it would have been unlikely, if not impossible, for sexual intercourse to have taken place unnoticed by anyone else who was at home at the time. Considering all these matters alongside GH’s own evidence, I conclude that it is highly probable that GH raped KB in the family home when no-one else was present. </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.01in">Other than the admission that the rape took place when GH was alone with KB in the family home, GH’s evidence about the rape lacks any credibility and I reject it. The Local Authority has not alleged that AB, CD or EF, were complicit in or present at the time of the rape or that they knew in the immediate aftermath what had occurred. The evidence establishes that on the balance of probabilities GH raped KB when left alone with her in the family home. That is his own evidence and it accords with the other evidence in the case. Accordingly, I do not accept AB’s evidence that she never left KB alone with GH. She has maintained that stance throughout these proceedings: it is what she told the authorities and it was what she has told CD and EF. However, I find it not to be credible. AB had no reason to protect KB from GH in that way and it would been natural for her sometimes to go out from the house to run errands or to do some work associated with her Church. She was a very busy woman and could not take KB everywhere with her. Leaving KB with another family member would be an entirely natural thing for her to do. At the relevant time, AB regarded GH as a member of the family. I conclude that AB has misled the court, her children, and others about leaving KB alone with GH because she wants to avoid being accused of being negligent in relation to her daughter’s care. She is afraid of being accused of allowing GH to rape KB by leaving them alone together and so she has denied ever having done so. I find that she did leave them alone, that it was natural to do so, and that she had no reason not to do so. There is no evidence that GH had acted inappropriately with KB previously, no evidence that he had been guilty of sexual assault or other sexually inappropriate behaviour with others previously, and he had spent a great deal of time with KB at the family home over several years without giving cause of concern that she needed protecting from him.</p>

In the light of his admission they can be discounted as perpetrators but, in any event, GH’s evidence about lodgers was inconsistent with other evidence and I do not accept it. He appeared to allege that there were lodgers in the family home in February or March 2020, at the time of the rape, but there is no evidence to corroborate that allegation. I accept the family’s evidence that two men had stayed at the family home for a short period some months earlier. </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">The arrangements for the care of KB changed when the Coronavirus pandemic began and lockdown restrictions were introduced. The Day Centre closed and KB lived with AB in the family home full time. JK stopped visiting; CD lived in the flat, EF was busy with his studies and going to the gym, and AB assumed all the care responsibilities for KB. Such were KB’s disabilities that she would need assistance with personal care including at the time of her periods. The rape must have taken place in late February or very early March 2020 given the subsequent dating of the pregnancy. AB consulted KB’s GP about missed periods for the first time by an e-consult (online form) on 30 July 2020. By then KB must have missed at least four and possibly five periods. AB wrote on the form completed on 30 July 2020, that the first day of KB’s last menstrual period had been on 22 May 2020. This cannot have been correct.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">On the same day, Thursday 30 July, a telephone consultation took place. AB told the GP that there had been “several months” of amenorrhoea, and that KB “used to have slightly irregular periods, but was every month before this … not sexually active and never has been but noticed breasts are swollen and stomach is swollen.” I take this to be reliable evidence that KB’s periods had been regular for some time prior to March 2020. The GP’s advice was to do a pregnancy test and to call back if positive. The test was done, and repeated, and both were positive but AB did not call the GP back. Instead she, and CD and EF (who knew of the positive test on 30 July but were not party to the advice given to AB by the GP) waited until the arranged appointment on Monday 3 August. At that appointment it was recorded “AB seemed initially cheerful in the consultation – stated she would have to look after the baby and that she was glad KB was not suffering from any sickness … [she] seemed to be expecting KB to continue the pregnancy.” The GP pointed out that as KB was unable to consent to sexual intercourse “we would be concerned about rape” which “seems to have come as a shock to AB.” In relation to KB’s periods, it is recorded by the GP that “she knows sometimes periods can be irregular and that is why she did not think about it much more since then and only after noticing the stomach swelling and breast swelling she thought something is not right.” </p>

No-one ever expected KB to be pregnant and that lack of expectation will have affected their views as to why she had missed her periods and put on weight. The senior GP at the practice also gave evidence saying that he believed it would be “possible to miss [that KB was pregnant] at this stage in the pregnancy.” He thought that given KB’s normal weight it would be possible even at 24 weeks pregnancy not to notice that KB was pregnant from her physical appearance.</p>

She did not seem alarmed or concerned for KB but, rather, appeared to be happy or at least remarkably resigned to the fact that she was going to have a baby. The Local Authority contends that AB’s attitude indicates that she had known about, and become reconciled to, the pregnancy for some time before alerting healthcare professionals. AB’s response to questioning about this during the hearing, supported by CD and EF, was that she had spent much of KB’s life being determinedly positive so as to avoid distress to KB. Also, her Christian faith and general personality gave her strength to present a cheerful demeanour even in difficult circumstances. She would put on a “mask” to present to the world. There may also have been an element of denial and an inability to confront the implications of the pregnancy including that KB had been raped.</p>

Neither am I persuaded that CD participated in KB’s personal care in February to July 2020 and would have known from dealing with KB’s personal care that she had missed her periods from March 2020 onwards.

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">By the end of May 2020 AB will have known that KB had missed her periods for three months having recently had regular periods. KB may have had some irregularity in her menstrual cycle previously but AB told KB’s GP in August 2020 that more recently KB’s periods had been regular up to the point where she stopped having them. I accept AB’s evidence that it did not cross her mind that KB had missed her periods because she was pregnant. She had no basis for believing that KB had engaged in sexual intercourse. I have found that GH raped KB when AB was absent and that AB was not aware of what had happened at the time or in the aftermath. It was unthinkable to her that KB might be pregnant. I accept her evidence that she initially thought that KB had just missed her periods because from time to time that can happen and because KB’s periods had been irregular in the past. Nevertheless, by the end of May it was evident that KB had a health issue having not had a period for three months. Furthermore, on the basis of AB’s oral evidence, it appears that by the end of June 2020 she noticed that KB was putting on weight. I accept AB’s evidence that she ultimately thought that KB might have fibroids rather than that she might be pregnant, but AB was able to contact the GP’s surgery, including using their on-line referral system, and she should have done so by the end of June 2020 given the several missed periods and unexplained weight gain. I emphasise that I accept that it did not cross AB’s mind that KB might be pregnant until very close to or at the time when the pregnancy was confirmed. CD told me, and I accept, that AB did not discuss the missed period with her. She did discuss KB’s weight gain which AB thought might be due to fibroids and CD thought might be due to a bowel problem. I do not criticise CD for failing to ensure medical advice or attention was secured for KB before the end of July 2020.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">At no stage after it was discovered that KB was pregnant, did AB, CD or EF raise the possibility of termination of the pregnancy. There was no urgency by them upon conducting the positive pregnancy tests at home on 30 July to alert the GP. They waited until the appointment on 3 August to inform the GP of the positive tests. However, the contemporaneous medical records show that following the appointment on 3 August 2020, neither was there any urgency on the part of healthcare professionals to address the issue of termination. KB was taken to the Maternity Assessment Unit on 3 August and a scan confirmed the pregnancy which was dated at 22 weeks and 3 days. The first appointment with an obstetrician appears to have been with Dr Clarke on 27 August 2020 when KB was 25 weeks pregnant. Dr Clarke says that she “confirmed with AB that termination of pregnancy was not something that she or the family were considering and AB explained that she would prefer KB to be delivered by elective caesarean section rather than have a trial of labour.” Dr Clarke’s next involvement was on 27 September 2020 when KB was at over 29 weeks of pregnancy and Dr Clarke’s view was that a caesarean section would be in KB’s best interests and proposed to carry out a sterilisation procedure at the time of the elective caesarean section. Applications were made to the Court of Protection in relation to best interest decisions regarding the management of the pregnancy, delivery and sterilisation (not ultimately pursued) on 30 October 2020. </p>

AB’s noted reaction can be explained by denial, desire to protect KB from distress, her faith, naivety, or a number of other psychological factors at play, but it was incumbent on healthcare professionals to note the urgency of the decision whether to terminate the pregnancy, to discuss that with AB and the family, and to consider whether an application to court was necessary. I note, as submitted by Ms Keehan in her helpful written submissions, that it is not at all certain that had a best interests decision been made in early August 2020, that it would have resulted in termination of the pregnancy. However, this was clearly something that should have been discussed with the family whatever indications they have about their initial views.</p>

By misusing direct payments in this way, AB prevented KB from having more paid care and assistance which would have been of benefit to her. AB thereby placed her own financial needs above the care needs of her daughter.</p>

However, GH was not truly employed as a carer for KB but was named as a paid carer in order to divert direct payments to the benefit of AB and GH. It is not proven that had police or other checks being performed by AB that GH would not have had unfettered access to and availability/opportunity to abuse KB, because GH was a member of the family and would have had such access in that capacity. Therefore there is no link between the dishonest misuse of the direct payments and the rape or any failure to protect KB from being raped by GH. I do not consider that AB was negligent or at fault for leaving KB alone with GH on the occasion of the rape, as I have found she did. I criticise her for failing to admit that she left them alone, but not for leaving them alone. There was nothing in GH’s history or his previous dealings with KB to give rise to a foreseeable risk that he would act as he did.</p>

In closing submissions the Local Authority accepted that there is limited evidence to make out this allegation against EF or GH. In my judgment it ought to have made a similar concession in relation to CD. As for AB, firstly I have found that she did not know of the pregnancy before 30 July 2020 (neither did CD or EF). Secondly, although the family delayed from 30 July 2020 to 3 August 2020 in informing the GP or the positive pregnancy test, I am satisfied that they did so when in shock and mindful of an appointment having been made. In any event, only AB had been party to the advice to contact the GP if the test was positive. The delay of four days did not materially affect the decision to continue the pregnancy. I am not satisfied that the evidence proves that AB or CD took any steps to prevent or delay medical professionals knowing about the pregnancy once they knew about it nor that they avoided, prevented or delayed discussions about termination. Indeed in my judgment, the greater responsibility for the failure expeditiously to consider termination lies with the healthcare professionals. Further, no financial or other motive for concealing the pregnancy or continuing it has been satisfactorily established.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:0.13in">In relation to the eighth, summary allegation, I find that AB has dishonestly misused the system of direct payments which were intended exclusively for the benefit of KB but which AB misused to divert monies to herself and GH for their financial benefit. However, such dishonest misuse did not afford GH access to KB, which he used to rape her,  which he would not otherwise have had as AB’s husband. GH’s rape of KB was opportunistic. It occurred when they were alone in AB’s home. There is no evidence that he has raped her on any other occasion. AB, CD and EF are not responsible for GH having raped KB by intentionally or negligently permitting him or allowing him the opportunity to do so. They had no grounds to believe that leaving KB alone with GH would expose her to the risk of being sexually assaulted by him. AB ought to have sought medical attention for KB by late June 2020 and had she done so the pregnancy is likely to have been detected about one month earlier than was in fact the case. However, AB did not know and it is not proved that she ought to have known that KB was showing signs of pregnancy. What might have been obvious signs of pregnancy in a sexually active woman, were not obvious signs of pregnancy in a woman whom it was reasonably assumed had never had sexual intercourse. KB and LB were put at risk of pre-birth complications and the risk of harm during delivery, and LB is at risk of future significant  emotional harm when he learns of the circumstances of his conception. However, those risks were not the foreseeable consequences of any deliberate or negligent acts or omissions by AB, CD or EF.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Although not alleged I have heard sufficient evidence to persuade me that on the balance of probabilities after the pregnancy was identified, AB knew or ought to have known that GH was a possible perpetrator and that by evasion and lack of positive co-operation she failed to share relevant information with the police that could have led to the earlier identification of GH as the prime suspect. AB did not tell the police what her true relationship with GH was, that GH spent time with KB and, as I have found, that she would sometimes leave him alone with KB. I am sure that she hid these facts because she was afraid that the truth would be shameful to her and the family and might expose her dishonest financial dealings. Although AB, CD and EF have chosen not to be forthcoming, it is difficult to be sure what AB told CD and EF about leaving KB alone with GH, but on balance I accept their evidence that she inaccurately told them that she had not left GH and KB alone. </p>

I shall invite the parties to agree directions for consideration of the welfare decisions that now have to be made in respect of the future arrangements for LB. To date the family has not made detailed proposals for those arrangements. I hope that they will have learned through the finding of fact process that broad generalisations will not be sufficient. Evasiveness will not help their cause. If, for example, CD continues to put herself forward as a permanent carer for LB then she will need to engage fully with the Local Authority to work out what the detailed arrangements would be. By offering herself as a Special Guardian for LB she would be taking on a very significant commitment which requires very careful prior consideration.</p>
