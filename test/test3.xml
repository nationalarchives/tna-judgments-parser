The second defender is in liquidation. Mrs Grant claims that the insurer would be liable to indemnify the second defender in respect of its vicarious liability for the wrongful acts of their employee, Mr Marcius, and that the right to be indemnified was transferred to and vested in her under the Third Party (Rights against Insurers) Act 2010 (“the 2010 Act”).</p>

That claim succeeded before the Lord Ordinary and the insurer’s reclaiming motion (appeal) was refused by the First Division of the Inner House of the Court of Session. The insurer now appeals to this court.</p>

Once outside, Mr Grant became involved in an altercation with the door stewards and hit out at Mr Hauley, who responded by punching or attempting to punch him. Mr Morley telephoned the police requesting their assistance. Mr Marcius took hold of Mr Grant around his shoulder or neck and he was wrestled to the ground. He applied a neck hold on Mr Grant and the other door stewards assisted in restraining him. The neck hold was applied for up to three minutes, and Mr Marcius was seen to lean on Mr Grant with all of his weight and put as much pressure on his windpipe as possible. Mr Grant continued to resist by kicking out for a short period of time, but he was then seen to turn blue and began to choke and cough. On the arrival of the police at the scene, Mr Grant was motionless and was pronounced dead shortly afterwards. The cause of death was mechanical asphyxia, caused by the application of the neck hold by Mr Marcius.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Marcius stood trial at the High Court in Aberdeen for the murder of Mr Grant. Evidence was led at trial to the effect that Mr Marcius had undergone training in minimising conflict, avoiding violence and on acceptable methods of restraint; that the neck hold applied to Mr Grant was not taught as an acceptable method of restraint; that such a neck hold is considered so dangerous that it is not demonstrated in a classroom setting; and that in applying the neck hold, Mr Marcius ignored his training. The jury did not accept that Mr Marcius had asphyxiated Mr Grant or caused his death and he was only convicted of assaulting Mr Grant, by seizing him on the neck, forcing him to the ground, placing him in a neck hold and restricting his breathing. The trial judge, Lady Wolffe, accepted that Mr Marcius’ actions were badly executed, not badly motivated. A non-custodial sentence was imposed consisting of a Community Payback Order with an unpaid work requirement of 250 hours.</p>

Cover was provided under eight different sections: Public/Products Liability; Inefficacy and Contractual Liability; Products Inefficacy; Wrongful Arrest; Loss of Keys; Financial Loss; Employers Liability, and Fidelity Guarantee.

Exclusion 14 is not intended to deal with the case where a door steward attempts to restrain a customer or would-be customer but in doing so negligently, or even recklessly, goes beyond a reasonable level of force. The use of the word ‘deliberate’ in the exclusion indicates that the employee’s act should be intended to cause the type of harm suffered by the victim. Even if that harm results from a deliberate act of the employee, such as punch or choke hold, unless the harm suffered was of the general nature intended by the employee, it cannot be said that the liability for that harm arose out of the ‘deliberate’ act of the employee.”</p>

The policy is to be interpreted objectively by asking what a reasonable person, with all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties when they entered into the contract, would have understood the language of the contract to mean. This involves a consideration of the words used in their documentary, factual and commercial context. This approach applies equally to exclusion clauses. The doctrine of interpretation contra proferentem is only relevant in a case of genuine ambiguity or real doubt as to the meaning of the words used - see <span style="font-style:italic">Impact Funding Solutions Ltd v Barrington Support Services Ltd</span> [2016] UKSC 57; [2017] AC 73, paras 6-7 per Lord Hodge.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The scope of an insuring clause in a public liability policy covering “accidental” injury was considered in the Court of Appeal decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Hawley v Luminar Leisure Ltd</span> [2006] EWCA Civ 18; [2006] PIQR P17, a case involving similar facts. It concerned a nightclub doorman who had punched the claimant, causing him to fall, fracture his skull and suffer permanent serious brain damage. The doorman was convicted of causing grievous bodily harm. The issue under the public liability policy of the doorman’s employer was whether the liability arose from “accidental bodily injury to any person”. The court held that it did because whether the injury was “accidental” was to be considered from the perspective of the assured - ie the employer rather than the doorman. It follows that, leaving aside the clause 14 exclusion, the policy in this case would cover deliberate acts by an employee which were “accidental” from the perspective of his or her employer.</p>

          <intro>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Another relevant aspect of context is that the policy is provided in respect of the second defender’s business of “Manned Guarding and Door Security Contractors”. There is a clear risk that door stewards will use a degree of force in carrying out their duties and that vicarious liability for their tortious acts may result. That is a public liability which is inherently likely to arise in connection with such a business. As observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Hawley</span> at para 108: “one of the most fundamental concepts underlying the policy was that the insured would be covered for damages which it had to pay owing to its vicarious liability for its employees’ torts. Thus, it can be said with real force that one would not expect the underwriters to be able to invoke [the employer’s] vicarious liability for its doormen as a ground for avoiding, as opposed to<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>accepting, liability under the policy.” This was a contextual matter stressed by all three members of the First Division - Lord Carloway at para 19; Lord Brodie at para 51 and Lord Drummond Young at para 62.

If, on the other hand, the man falls over and suffers more serious injury, as in <span style="font-style:italic">Hawley</span>, the exclusion would be inapplicable. Equally, if he only succeeds in inflicting a lesser injury, such as bruising, the exclusion would be inapplicable. There is no commercial or other logic in excluding precision injuries in this way. Why should the parties choose to make coverage depend on the happenstance of whether a targeted injury does or does not result? This is largely a matter of chance. There are, moreover, real difficulties in identifying and establishing the requisite intention for these purposes. In many cases there will not be an intention to cause a specific injury. A more rational and workable distinction might be between an intention to cause really serious injury or a lesser injury, but there is no support in the policy for drawing distinctions of this kind, and, in any event, it begs definitional questions.</p>

Doing so, however, still leads to difficulties and arbitrary results. For example, in relation to shock causing bodily injury, is the requisite intention to cause shock causing the specific injury which results, even though that injury may well be unforeseeable? In relation to death, while one can well understand why the act of murder should be excluded, if the relevant intent was to cause really serious injury rather than to kill then the exclusion would not apply, even though under English law it would still be murder. Equally, one can well understand why attempted murder should be excluded, but since that requires an intention to kill but no resulting death, the exclusion would not apply.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Milligan also relied on the decision of the Supreme Court of South Australia in <span style="font-style:italic">Clayton v Mutual Community General Insurance Pty Ltd</span> (1995) 64 SASR 353. In that case a house insurance policy included an exclusion of “loss or damage caused by the deliberate or intentional acts committed by you”. The claimant’s husband committed suicide by deliberately igniting petrol fumes in a motor car, in the carport which formed part of the insured premises. The fire destroyed the car, damaged the carport and spread to the house itself causing extensive damage. The trial judge held that cover was excluded because the igniting of the fumes resulting in fire was a deliberate and intentional<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>act and it caused the loss. This decision was reversed on appeal. The court held that the exclusion only applied if there was intention to cause damage to the insured premises, which there was not. Mr Milligan relied in particular on King CJ’s statement at para 13 that:</p>

Quite apart from the fact that the <span style="font-style:italic">Clayton</span> case involved a different type of policy and different policy wording, however, Mr Milligan reads far too much into this paragraph. In the context of a house insurance policy, it is entirely understandable that the intent should relate to damage to the insured premises rather than the act which gave rise to that damage or damage to any other property. Equally, in the context of a policy covering public liability for “injury”, it is understandable that the intention should relate to injury rather than the act which gave rise to that injury, as the insurer accepts. Moreover, there was no suggestion in the <span style="font-style:italic">Clayton</span> case that a distinction should be drawn between different types or extent of damage to the insured premises.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Milligan further submitted that it makes commercial sense and accords with “social justice” for the insurance coverage of an employer of door stewards under a public liability policy to match the scope of the employer’s vicarious liability for his employee’s acts, which will generally include deliberate wrongdoing, unless committed for personal reasons. It was not, however, suggested that there was any regulatory requirement for there to be such insurance cover and whether or not that was the coverage obtained by the second defender in this case must depend on the wording in fact agreed rather than pre-supposition.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Finally, Mr Milligan had a fallback argument that the relevant “deliberate act” was the neck hold committed with the intention to cause serious injury. It was said that <span style="font-family:TimesNewRomanPSMT">“liability arising out of deliberate acts” addresses acts which the employee performs where the liability bears a relationship of proportionality to the employee’s </span>intention. Where the injury is death, the exclusion will only be triggered where the intention is one to cause serious injury. It was not, however, explained how this interpretation derives from the wording of the policy. The policy draws no distinction between injuries of differing seriousness nor does it require or refer to proportionality. Whilst one can understand an interpretation embracing an act causing “injury” or an act causing the “injury”, there is simply no foundation in the policy wording for it to embrace an act causing “serious injury”, an expression found nowhere in the policy.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Kenneth McBrearty QC for the insurer submitted that “deliberate”, which qualifies “acts”, and “wilful”, which qualifies “neglect or default” should be interpreted as synonymous. He suggested that “neglect or default” referred to omissions and that the intention was to qualify both acts and omissions in the same way. The language used simply reflected the fact that in normal usage “deliberate” is the more natural adjective to describe a positive act, while “wilful” is more apt to describe an omission. He then relied on authorities in which “wilful” has been held to include recklessness to support a case that the same meaning should be given to “deliberate” in the context of clause 14. Both should therefore be interpreted as meaning an intention to cause injury, or recklessness as to whether injury will be caused.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In support of his submission that “wilful” may include recklessness, Mr McBrearty relied on the Court of Appeal’s decision in <span style="font-style:italic">CP (a child) v Royal London Mutual Insurance Co Ltd</span> [2006] 1 CLC 576. That case concerned a fire which had been started by an 11 year old boy who had set fire to paper in a den he had built in the derelict part of a mill building. The fire caused extensive damage to the building and the issue was whether the claim under an insurance policy for accidental damage to property was excluded by an exemption from liability for claims and liabilities arising from “wilful, malicious or criminal acts”. In considering the meaning of “wilful” in the context of this clause in the policy, Tuckey LJ stated as follows at para 16:</p>
          </intro>
          <subparagraph>
            <content>
              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">“Obviously if the act is deliberate and intended to cause damage of the kind in question it will be within the exclusion. It will be wilful, as the judge held, and might also be malicious or criminal. But for an act to be wilful I do not think it is necessary to go as far as this. It will be enough to show that the insured was reckless as to the consequences of his act. Recklessness has been variously defined but if someone does something knowing that it is risky or not caring whether it is risky or not he is acting recklessly. Put more precisely for present purposes if the insured is aware that what he is about to do risks damage of the kind which gives rise to the claim or does not care whether there is such a risk or not, he will act recklessly if he goes ahead and does it. I think such conduct was intended to be included in the exclusion and I would equate a reckless act with a wilful act for this purpose. This approach focuses upon the state of the insured’s mind when he does the act rather than its intended consequences. Defined in this way the exclusion does not require the insured to intend to cause damage of the kind in question.”</p>

In my opinion that question must be answered in the negative unless he knows that he is committing, and intends to commit, a breach of his duty, or is recklessly careless in the sense of not caring whether his act or omission is or is not a breach of duty.”</p>

This is the most plausible explanation of the use of the adjective “wilful”. An “act” is not the counterpart to a breach of duty and so there is no basis for Mr McBrearty’s supposedly “logical” submission that “deliberate” and “wilful” must have the same meaning.</p>

As is well known, and the cases we have been referred to illustrate, recklessness may be defined in various different ways and the policy provides no clue as to what it should be taken to mean in relation to “deliberate acts”.</p>

The consequence of accepting the insurer’s argument that “acts” in clause 14 refers to the act of causing injury, rather than the specific injury resulting, is that an exemption of reckless acts would lead to a very wide and commercially unlikely exclusion, given the nature of the second defender’s business.</p>

He emphasised in particular the manifestly dangerous nature of the neck hold; the length of time for which it was applied; the weight and pressure exerted and its apparent effect on Mr Grant. The difficulty for the insurer, however, is that there was no finding by the courts below of intention to injure, or even of recklessness. It is not for the Supreme Court to find facts.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The conviction for assault does not establish any intention beyond an intention to perform the act of assault, namely the neck hold. This is clearly explained in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Lord</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">Advocate’s Reference (No 2 of 1992)</span> 1993 JC 43. In that case a man was charged with assault with intent to rob when he entered a shop holding out an imitation gun and said words to the effect: “Get the money out of the till and lay on the floor”. He claimed that this was a joke and the issue on appeal to the High Court of Justiciary was whether this evidence was relevant to the necessary intent for his actions to amount to an assault. It was held that it was not and that the necessary intent was established by the fact that the act of assault was deliberate. Lord Cowie stated at p 51B-D as follows:</p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">“The point is a short one and it depends upon what is meant by the words ‘evil intent’ insofar as they form an essential element in the crime of assault. In my opinion the meaning of the words in the context of this offence is not to be obtained from a wide review of the circumstances surrounding the incident but is to be derived directly from the quality of the act, in the first place, and, in the second place, whether that act was committed deliberately as opposed to carelessly, recklessly or negligently. It is the quality of the act itself, assuming that there was no justification for it, which must be considered in deciding whether it was evil … Having established that the act is an evil one, all that is then required to constitute the crime of assault is that that act was done deliberately and not carelessly, recklessly or negligently.”</p>

The pointing of a gun at a shop assistant accompanied by words such as those used by the pannel would undoubtedly constitute the <span style="font-style:italic">actus reus</span> of the crime of assault and if these things are done deliberately and intentionally, as they were done here, the <span style="font-style:italic">mens rea</span> is also, in my opinion, established.”</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Lady Wolffe’s sentencing remarks similarly provide no support for the insurer’s case on intention to injure. To the contrary she found that: “It was said on your behalf that what you did was badly executed, not badly motivated … I accept what was said on your behalf in this regard.” This was consistent with the evidence that Mr Marcius gave at his police interview, also referred to by Lady Wolffe, that “you believed you were acting in defence of your fellow door stewards and to minimise the danger you felt Mr Grant posed to others.”</p>
