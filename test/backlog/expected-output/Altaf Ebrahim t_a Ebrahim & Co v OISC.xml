It carries on business from offices in Wembley. The notepaper states that it provides “Legal Services”. (Until early in 2001 Mr Ebrahim was sole proprietor, and the description on the notepaper was “Asian Legal Services”.) Since neither partner is a solicitor, and the legal services provided plainly include immigration work, it was necessary for the firm to apply to the Immigration Services Commissioner for registration under section 84 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 (“the Act”).</span></p>

Nearly a year later, by a letter of 16 April 2002 signed by a caseworker, Annabelle Lim, on his behalf the Commissioner stated that he “cannot be satisfied that [the Appellant] and its advisers are competent and fit to provide immigration advice and/or immigration services and refuses this application.”</span></p>

We heard the appeal on 2 December 2002. Ms Atcha represented the firm; she called Mr Ebrahim as a witness and gave evidence herself. The Commissioner was represented by Ms Jennifer Richards of counsel. In the absence of Ms Lim on maternity leave Mr Clive Copus, a caseworker who has recently taken over the file, gave evidence for the Commissioner.</span></p>

The bundle of documents compiled by the Treasury Solicitor for the Respondent, disclosed to the Appellant and lodged with the Tribunal, included a number of legally privileged memoranda. One of these, an e-mail containing advice from Mr Roland Phillips of the Treasury Solicitor’s office, was included in the Chairman’s bundle but not in the bundles copied to the two lay members. Ms Atcha submitted that she should be allowed to adduce it in evidence. In our view legally privileged documents disclosed in error should not be admitted in evidence. We therefore refused the application.</span></p>

He conducts interviews and gives advice, leaving advocacy work to others. He sees about 20 clients a day, including at weekends. The firm has two or three hearings each week before Immigration Adjudicators. They have not been criticised by any adjudicator nor by the Immigration Appeal Tribunal in 10 years of doing the work. They get involved in 5 or 6 judicial review applications per year. </span></p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:12pt"> Mr Bachcha entered the UK on a false passport on 1 March 1998. He was detained as an illegal entrant from 25 August 2000 onwards and during the period October 2000 to May 2001 was a prisoner at HMP Leicester, convicted of certain immigration offences.. He claimed asylum on 22 September 2000 but the claim was certified  by the Secretary of State under paragraph 9(6)(a) of Schedule 4 to the Act. Ebrahim &amp; Co were contacted by relatives of Mr Bachcha and asked to act for him. </span></p>

Ms Richards criticised this as inadequate and tending to show that the firm was not fit and competent. We disagree. Clearly the telephone is far from ideal as a sole means of communication between immigration adviser and client; but Mr Bachcha was in Leicester Prison and the funds which his relatives could make available may have been limited.</span></p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:12pt">On 13 March 2001 Mr Bachcha’s case came before an adjudicator, Mr O’Malley, sitting at Birmingham. Mr Bachcha was present and was represented by Mr Alex Nzeyi, a law student who did a substantial amount of work for Ebrahim &amp; Co including some advocacy. We return to the subject of Mr Nzeyi’s employment later in this judgment.</span></p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The adjudicator’s written decision, in the usual way, begins by listing the advocates and describes Mr Nzeyi as a “Solicitor”. Ms Richards relied on this as evidence of knowingly misleading the adjudicator, though it is right to say that this was not in the forefront of her submissions. We do not have the attendance slip nor any evidence from the adjudicator. It is, however, within the experience of all three members of the Tribunal that advocates are frequently given the wrong professional description in the decisions of tribunals, especially where a wide range of people have a right to appear. On the evidence available to us we consider that this allegation of misleading behaviour is not made out.</span></p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Mr Nzeyi’s task was not an enviable one.  The client, in his asylum interview, had alleged that “thugs” had tried to kill him by shooting him in the leg. But in the same interview he had admitted that his main reason for leaving India, of which he was a citizen, had been the problem of unemployment. He had not said anything at that stage about relatives in the UK (which would have laid the foundation for an argument, such as it was, under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights); but such relatives existed and had instructed first another firm, then Ebrahim &amp; Co. The previous firm was exercising a lien over the papers until £300 was paid towards their fees, although it is not clear what, if any, additional material the papers would have provided.</span></p>

In any event what passed between him and Mr Bachcha is covered by privilege which can only be waived by the client. We have to do the best we can from the documents, in particular the adjudicator’s decision. </span></p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:12pt">Mr Nzeyi decided not to call the client, nor to ask for an adjournment, but to ask for time to put in written submissions. The Tribunal takes the view that this was a legitimate judgment call. Calling the client would almost certainly have resulted in his swift demolition in cross examination. Adjournments are not readily granted by adjudicators, to whom many such applications are made simply in order to postpone the day of reckoning. On the other hand, where an adjournment has not been sought time may well be given to put in written submissions, as happened here. Thus far we do not criticise the firm’s performance in this case.</span></p>

The Article 8 claim was no doubt a weak one, but it could and should have been made, especially since the adjudicator had granted the opportunity for written submissions. As Ms Richards pointed out, it was not necessary to obtain the files from Mohammed &amp; Co in order to be able to state what the interference with Mr Bachcha’s family life would be; and even if it had been, we doubt whether the adjudicator would have felt able simply to ignore written submissions which arrived, say, on the 15</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:12pt">th</span><span style="font-size:12pt"> day after the hearing with a suitable explanatory letter. We are far  from saying that such submissions would have made any difference: indeed Mr Bachcha’s case may well have been hopeless.</span></p>

The previous day Ebrahim &amp; Co faxed a letter to the Home Office taking the Article 8 point. Not surprisingly the response was unfavourable, but the date of removal was delayed until 22 May. On 21 May Ebrahim &amp; Co lodged an application for judicial review in the name of Mr Bachcha at the Administrative Court. It had to be in his name, as they are not solicitors, but his address was given as “c/o 66A Ealing Road, Wembley, Middlesex” [the Appellant firm’s address]. In the space for a signature to attest to the Statement of Truth Mr Bachcha’s name and initials are given in block capitals. </span></p>

            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:12pt">This was unsatisfactory for a number of reasons. Firstly, in a High Court application immigration advisers who are not solicitors cannot act. The Statement of Truth in a  claim for judicial review made by a litigant in person must be signed by that person, not by an agent on his behalf. Secondly, a professional person, whether a solicitor or an immigration adviser, is under a duty not to initiate court proceedings which are plainly hopeless. We think that the judicial review application was in that category. The Article 8 point would, as we have already observed, been late in the day and weak had it first been made before the adjudicator or in written submissions to him after the hearing. Made for the first time in a judicial review application the day before the proposed removal of the client from the UK, it was doomed to failure. We consider that the handling of the case in this way demonstrates incompetence, in that the point should either have been raised earlier or not at all. It is not necessary to decide whether it also constitutes evidence of advising a client to abuse asylum procedures, and without knowing whether the initiative for the judicial review came from the client or the firm that would not be an easy matter to determine.</span></p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-size:12pt">The substantive complaint about the employment of Mr Nzeyi is as follows. Mr Nzeyi was a law student at Thames Valley University who successfully graduated, we were told, this year. He is not a British citizen. The Immigration Rules allow a person who obtains leave to enter the UK as a student to undertake work provided that it is “part time or vacation work undertaken with the consent of the Secretary of State for Employment”. Mr Nzeyi obtained permission to work for Ebrahim &amp; Co on 30 March 1999. The rules laid down by the relevant Department, then the Department for Education and Employment, state that during term time students to whom the Rules apply may not work more than 20 hours per week: this information is available in the publications “Leaflet for Students” and “Questions and Answers for Employers”. But Mr Nzeyi, as he has readily admitted in correspondence, worked an average of  35 hours per week for the Appellant firm, and longer in vacations.</span></p>

At first Mr Ebrahim tried to explain it away by drawing a distinction between work as such and a student’s work experience, arguing that the latter does not count. But eventually he accepted that Mr Nzeyi did indeed work more than the limit of 20 hours per week.</span></p>

As against that, the lay members of the Tribunal, each of whom has extensive experience in the field, regard it as highly significant that despite their considerable turnover of immigration work there is no evidence of other complaints (other than one or possibly two withdrawn ones), let alone adverse findings, against the Appellant firm.</span></p>

Secondly, we note that under paragraph 3 of Schedule 6 to the Act the Commissioner may require registered persons to apply for continuation of their registration, and that different intervals may be fixed in relation to different registered persons. </span></p>

We hope and expect that Ebrahim &amp; Co will observe the standards properly to be expected of registered persons. Nothing in this judgment should be regarded as giving them grounds for complacency.</span></p>
