      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">UNFAIR DISMISSAL</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">For the purposes of the law of unfair dismissal, section 95(1)(a) </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Employment Rights Act 1996</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> provides that the concept of dismissal includes a case in which the contract of employment is terminated by the employer.</span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">In the present case, by a letter of 16 April 2019, the employee resigned by giving nine months’ notice to take effect on 16 January 2020. On 19 December 2019 the employer invoked a clause in the contract enabling it, following the employee having resigned, to “terminate the [employee’s] employment forthwith” by paying to him the salary, excluding bonuses, to which he would have been entitled in the remainder of the period of notice that had been given by him. As a result, the contract ended on 19 December 2019, instead of on 16 January 2020. </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The employment tribunal considered itself bound by the majority decision of the EAT in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Marshall (Cambridge) Limited v Hamblin</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> [1994] ICR 962, to conclude that the invocation, following a resignation, of a clause permitting the employer to terminate the contract upon making a prescribed payment calculated by reference to the unexpired period of the employee’s notice does not, as a matter of law, amount to a dismissal. On appeal the employee accepted that </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Marshall v Hamblin</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> stood for that proposition of law, and that if it must be followed, then the appeal must be dismissed. But it was argued that the EAT ought not to follow it, in particular, because it was manifestly wrong. </span></p>
      <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Held</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">: The circumstances in which the EAT will depart from its own previous decisions are tightly circumscribed. One of them is where a previous decision is “manifestly wrong”, which means that it can be seen to be obviously wrong, without the need for extensive or complicated argument: </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">British Gas Trading v Lock</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> [2016] ICR 503 </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">at [77] to [80]. Despite the reasoning in the decision itself being problematic, the proposition of law said to emerge from </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000">Marshall v Hamblin</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#000000"> could not be said to be obviously wrong, without needing any detailed consideration or analysis of the arguments or potentially relevant authorities. That being so, it could not be said to be manifestly wrong, so as to enable the EAT to depart from it. The appeal must therefore be dismissed.</span></p>

We do not accept Miss Boswell's argument based on section 49(3) of the 1978 Act.  In our view, the words "waiving his right to notice" mean waiving a right to insist that notice should be given in accordance with a contract of employment.  In this case the applicant had given notice.  This fact is agreed.  In the circumstances, the question of waiving a right to notice just does not arise.  One cannot waive a right to notice in a case where notice has already been given.</span></p>

On 30 November 1990 Mr Pickett purported to terminate the applicant's contract of employment - and did so.  In the Notice of Appearance the respondents have said that they used their discretion in making a payment in lieu of notice in accordance with the terms and conditions of employment.  An employer, in our view, cannot make a payment in lieu of an unexpired period of notice already given by an employee.  The meaning of "in lieu of" is perfectly plain.  In this case there was no question of the respondents giving notice to the applicant:  it was the applicant who had given notice to the respondents.</span></p>

In most cases, where there is no element of commission, no doubt an employer can satisfy his obligation to pay an employee during a notice period by making a payment in lieu of notice.  A  payment in lieu of notice, as the Court of Appeal have recently emphasised, is a payment of liquidated damages for breach of a contract of employment.  In a case where the prospect of earning commission during the notice period may be a substantial one, a payment in lieu of notice will not absolve an employer from his obligations.  We agree with Miss Boswell that an employee cannot insist on remaining in employment after giving notice.  In circumstances such as this, a mutual agreement is called for.  Such a mutual agreement, as pointed out in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">McAlwane v Boughton Estates Ltd</span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> [1973] 2 A11 ER 299, a case referred to us by Miss Boswell, will not alter the original character of the termination of contract of employment; it will merely alter the notice period.  In this case, there was no attempt to reach any agreement as to the liability to pay commission during the notice period.</span></p>

This is by far the most common type of payment in lieu and the present case falls into this category. The employer is in breach of contract by dismissing the employee without proper notice. However, the summary dismissal is effective to put an end to the employment relationship, whether or not it unilaterally discharges the contract of employment. Since the employment relationship has ended no further services are to be rendered by the employee under the contract. It follows that the payment in lieu is not a payment of wages in the ordinary sense since it is not a payment for work done under the contract of employment.</span></p>

With respect we do not consider that this is a correct analysis of the situation. Until such time as the employee's notice expires, the contract of employment continues. The employer is entitled to utilise a term of that contract to bring the employment to an end at an earlier date than the date of the expiry of the employee's notice. The waiver of the employer is in relation to the period of notice (provided he pays the appropriate sum in lieu). In spite of some considerable hesitation we have come to the conclusion that in a contract of employment which gives the employer option to make a payment in lieu, there is no right in the employee to work out his notice.</span></p>

At one stage we were attracted to the argument that an employer in such cases is under a duty to allow the employee to earn his commission. A waiver of notice and a payment in lieu prevents the employee earning such commission and the employer would thereby be in breach of contract. With some hesitation we have reached the conclusion that two factors negate that approach. The first is that there is no right to commission at all under the contract. All payments are made at the discretion of the Company under the terms of the contract. We considered whether, although there was no right to payment of commission, was there a breach by the employer of preventing the employee from placing himself in a position where the Company's discretion could be exercised towards him? In the final analysis we considered this goes beyond the accepted approach that an employer may not prevent an employee from </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;color:#000000">earning</span><span style="font-weight:bold;color:#000000"> a commission.</span></p>

It is deliberately not defined by reference to an exhaustive list or in some other way because one cannot predict what circumstances will arise in the future and which may justify departure from an earlier decision.  In this way courts and tribunals retain the flexibility required to do justice in the case before them.  On the other hand it is also important to recall that certainty in the law is also a fundamental value: indeed it lies at the root of the concept of legal certainty which is well-established in EU law and on which reliance has been placed by Mr Cavanagh in the course of his submissions albeit in a different context.”</span></p>

Furthermore it would in the meantime merely create uncertainty for everyone who has to apply the relevant legislation, including the Employment Tribunal, which is bound by decisions of this Appeal Tribunal.

The fact that the employer has acted in a manner that is permitted by, and compliant with, the contract is irrelevant. It does not affect the fact that it is still the conduct of the employer which actually brings the employment to an end on that earlier date.

As to that I note that, in coming to their conclusion at [15], they referred to the employer having paid wages, but not commission, “until the expiry of the notice”. Those words read alone might suggest that they understood the case to be one in which the employment still ended on the date given in the employee’s notice. But, as EJ Dyal discussed, reading the decision as a whole, the majority appear to have regarded the case as one in which, factually, the employer used a term of the contract to bring the employment to an end on a date earlier than the date on which the employee’s notice would otherwise have expired. On that reading, the phrase “until the expiry of the notice” was a loose compression that perhaps meant, more precisely, something like: “ in the amount that would have been due in the period remaining until the expiry of the notice.” In all events, as I have noted, Mr Jackson did not pursue on appeal the argument that the case was viewed by the majority as factually one in which the original termination date did not change.</span></p>

The nub of his case, in short, is that it is plainly and obviously wrong to suggest that this combination of features makes any difference. The position, in such a case, remains that it is the unilateral conduct of the employer that has caused the employment to end on the earlier date, and so that must be a termination by the employer, regardless of the fact that it is parasitic upon a resignation, and was carried out in a manner permitted by the contract.</span></p>

The employer did not accede to a request by the employee to release him early. The majority’s discussion under the heading “commission” also seems to me have cast no light on whether there was a termination by the employer in that case; nor did the proposition that the EAT was not bound by the employer’s concession of wrongful dismissal; nor did the proposition (though true, as such) that it is not the case that any (that is to say, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">every</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">) termination during a period of the employee’s notice will amount to a dismissal. </span></p>

Mr Jackson is right, I think, that the cases discussed there all concerned a scenario in which an employer dismissed on notice, the employee then evinced a wish to leave sooner, the employer agreed in principle to that happening, and, one way or another, that was then brought about. The same can be said of another case on which Mr Jackson relied for illustrative purposes, </span><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Palfrey v Transco plc</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> [2004] IRLR 916, although there the dismissal was found to have been “brought forward” by a fresh employer’s notice, with the adverse consequence for the employee that his tribunal claim was out of time.</span></p>
