            <content>
              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The appeal in TC/2021/00667 relates to an assessment in the sum of £184,280.73 issued by Officer Selant on 4 September 2020.  The appeal in TC/2021/00879 relates to an assessment in the sum of £136,250.27 issued by Officer Selant on 5 September 2020.  The total amount subject to hardship considerations is therefore £320,531.50.</p>
            </content>

            <content>
              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The general rule in the Finance Act 1994 is that an appellant who wishes to bring an appeal against an assessment issued under section 12 Finance Act 1994 (“FA94”) must pay or deposit the amount of the assessment with HMRC. If not, HMRC have the power to issue a certificate stating either that they have received adequate security from the appellant or that on the grounds of potential hardship a lesser level of, or no, security suffices. If no such certificate is issued by HMRC an appellant can apply to the Tribunal to decide whether HMRC should not have refused to grant such a certificate and that a reasonable level of security, if any, has been given.</p>

            <content>
              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In this appeal the appellant has simply told HMRC that payment of the duty to HMRC would cause it hardship.  HMRC were not persuaded by the information provided by the appellant and have not accepted the appellant’s position.  The appellant now appeals to the Tribunal.</p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">With the consent of the parties, the hearing was conducted by video link using the Tribunal’s video hearing system.  A face-to-face hearing was not held because of the difficulty of ensuring the safety of all participants.  The documents to which I was referred comprised a Bundle consisting of 518 pages.  I also had an Authorities Bundle extending to 78 pages.  The appellant had also lodged a Profit and Loss account and a letter from a Licensed Insolvency Practitioner. </p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Since no Skeleton Arguments had been lodged an unheralded argument arose as to the distinction between the wording in section 84(3) Value Added Tax Act 1994 (“VATA”) and section 16(3) FA94.  </p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">There was an equally unheralded argument advanced on section 3 Human Rights Act 1998 (“HRA”).  In those circumstances, having due regard to Rule 2 of the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Tax Chamber) Rules 2009 (as amended) ("the Rules") I asked both counsel if they would wish to lodge written submissions on those matters.  </p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">I therefore issued Directions of consent.  When issuing those Directions I pointed out to the parties that both had relied on the First-tier Tribunal (“FTT”) decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Elbrook (Cash &amp; Carry) Limited</span> whereas I would also always look at the decision in the Upper Tribunal which is cited at 2017 UKUT 181 (TCC). I pointed out that I agreed with Judge Poole in <span style="font-style:italic">NT ADA Limited v HMRC</span> [2019] UKFTT 0333 (TC) (“NT”) where he set out a review of the relevant case law in relation to VAT and hardship.</p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Lastly, I pointed out to the parties that the two Review Conclusion Letters indicate that the Post Clearance Demand Notes (“PCDNs”) include in their totals both Customs Duty and Import VAT.  In fact the Customs Duty charged is in the sums of £107,206.32 and £18,805.21 and the Import VAT is in the sums of £77,074.41 and £117,445.06.</p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On 12 August 2020, HMRC issued a decision letter to the effect that a PCDN in the sum of £184,280.73 comprising Customs Duty of £107,206.32 and Import VAT of £77,074.41 would be issued. The basis for the decision was that following two separate assurance visits on 5 November 2019 and 22 November 2019 it had been established that 155 items covering 60 import entries have been undervalued. A customs debt was therefore deemed to have arisen. On 4 September 2020 the PCDN was issued.</p>

The officer had identified 86 imports between 10 October 2017 and 7 November 2017 which did not meet the conditions for Onward Supply Relief. Of those entries 52 were further identified as being classified to incorrect commodity codes. A customs debt was therefore deemed to have arisen. On 4 September 2020 the PCDN was issued.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Firstly, Mr Birkbeck was correct in arguing that there was a distinct lack of transparency in the evidence from Mr Chi. His evidence on the deposits can best be described as opaque. In his witness statement it was stated, again, that there were two deposits of £100,000 and £160,000, the latter of which had been repaid. When he was taken to the bank statements, the deposits in the sums stated could not be identified. He then conceded that the “deposit” would not be “an exact amount”. Then he conceded that it would have included “other things” which remained unspecified. </p>

It should not involve a lengthy investigation of assets and liabilities, and an ability to pay in the future, see <span style="font-style:italic">Seymour Limousines Ltd</span> (above) at [58].

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0.39in">Whether resources are immediately or readily available to pay the tax without hardship is a value judgment.  The test is not simply of capacity to pay, but capacity to pay without financial hardship.  Thus, the mere existence of cash or other readily realisable resources will not necessarily suffice, if the employment of those resources in paying the disputed cash would have consequences that would cause financial hardship.  The requirement that the resources be immediately or readily available is a reflection of the structure of s 84(3B), which looks to the existing financial position of the appellant, and does not require enquiry as to possible future action or any potential resources that might become available in the future (see <span style="font-style:italic">Buyco Limited and Sellco Limited v Revenue and Customs Commissioners</span> [2006] UKVAT V19752, at [8].”</p>

We accept that HMRC has refused the appellant’s hardship applications on grounds that referred only to not paying or depositing the (full) amount, and that their decision did not expressly refer to the provision of security for all or part of the amount as contemplated for excise duty purposes. However, we do not think that that affects our jurisdiction to determine the matter under s 16(3)(b) FA 1994, and Mr Brown did not argue otherwise. The appellant also did not offer any security at all, so must be treated as having asked that no security should be required. We find that it is not the case that it would have been reasonable in the circumstances for the Commissioners to accept no security, and therefore the appellant has not satisfied the test in s 16(3)(b).”</p>

However, he argued that those words do not occur in section 16 FA94.  Rather, the purpose of Parliament was to give the Tribunal jurisdiction to review HMRC’s decision only.  Section 16 has to be read as a whole and it can be seen by the following provision at section 16(4) in relation to ancillary matters, that that is the clear intention.</p>

In deciding whether the Respondent’s decision was unreasonable, the FTT is not bound by the factual determinations that the Respondent made. Nor is the FTT limited to a consideration of evidence that was before the Respondent’s decision maker. It was, therefore, open to the Appellant to produce evidence that was not before the Respondent when it made its review decision and invite the FTT to reach factual conclusions different from those that the Respondent reached in its review. Moreover, the Appellant was entitled to argue that, in the light of those different factual conclusions, the Respondent’s decision was unreasonable.
