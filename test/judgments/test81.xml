His covering email spoke about his concerns, but stated “I have not reported it to social services, but I have put it on file with my solicitor as that is the right thing to do…”  Mother responded at 16:42 on 24 October 2022, stating “Firstly, yes I have and can raise my voice at our son when he is misbehaving and as for ‘slapping him’ yes I have on occasion lightly smacked him. There is a big difference between a light smack and what you are implying”. Later the same day she sent another email speaking about the “lies and fabrication from our son…” and the fact it was a huge concern for her that “he can lie at that level about things that have absolutely never happened”. The Child continued to spend time with Father.</span></p>

In 2019 Mother’s refusal included Mother explaining that she was already taking the Child abroad for 10 days, so it would be a bit too much for him to go abroad again. Mother only agreed to Father taking the Child abroad on 2 occasions at most (Father says 1), one of which she insisted Father was accompanied by his sister. On Christmas Day 2022 the paternal grandparents attended to collect the Child. They asked Mother for the Child’s passport, on the basis Father was intending to take the Child abroad, no notice having been given. The Mother refused.</span></p>

With his application he filed a C1A alleging emotional and psychological abuse of him, and physical, emotional and psychological abuse of the Child. Mother responded with her own C1A on 14 March 2023, alleging emotional and financial abuse of her, and emotional and psychological abuse of the Child. A description of what happened included allegations by Mother that she had been advised by the Child’s school, counsellor and legal advice to temporarily suspend contact, given the extent of emotional harm and distress the Child was showing and the application (to the Court) and that there had “been a significant number of weekends (too frequent to particularise here) where the (Father) simply passed up the opportunity to have (the Child) himself and has asked the Paternal family to step in and assist”.</span></p>

Interim contact was agreed to commence on 23 December 2023, supported by the same psychotherapist Father had previously challenged. The directions included the parties having a further opportunity to serve witness statements by 4pm on 13 February 2024. Strict directions were given for preparation of the case for the final hearing.</span></p>

The statements were not served until the end of February 2024, with neither party bringing an application to rely on them out of time. An “unagreed” bundle was filed, which did not include Mother’s final statement. It contained contact notes without permission, despite the requirement to seek the permission of the court under PD27A. The pagination of the hard copy bundle did not match the digital page numbering of the digital bundle. The bundle did not comply with the limit of 350 pages. The hard copy bundle was stuffed into a single lever arch file, which was overly heavy and in which the pages could not be turned properly as a result. A second bundle of “correspondence” was filed, again  without permission. There was no hearing time estimate, and no reading list was provided to assist the judge. There was video evidence which the Court was asked to watch, but no arrangements had been made for this. There was also no transcript of the video evidence.</span></p>

The Court was informed screens had been in place at every hearing, despite there being no record of this or any direction in the previous Orders.

She accepted they were not relevant to welfare and were not being pursued at the hearing. Father raising no objection, a screen was allowed.</span></p>

The start was put back until just before 11:45am to allow the documentation to be considered. By that time Father had confirmed the only breach he was pursuing was the interruption of contact from 1 January 2023 onwards, Mother was not pursuing allegations of historic controlling behaviour and it was accepted that Mother’s statement was inaccurate in respect of Father’s criminal convictions and in describing the contact as supervised. A tight timetable was put forward, and the Court observed it left little time for any decision. It also failed to provide for the possibility that the Court may have some questions pursuant to its inquisitorial role.</span></p>

She also agreed additional time at half-terms (+2 days), Easter (4 consecutive nights) and an alternating 23 December at 10am to 12:30 Christmas Day/12:30 Christmas Day to 10 am on 28 December pattern at Christmas plus 2 consecutive additional days.

The Court was asked to find that Mother had breached the 2016 Order without reasonable excuse, but the Father did not seek any form of punishment of Mother as a result. In terms of division of time, Father sought a long-term goal of equal time with each parent and requested full 2 overnight weekend stays on reintroduction of the 2016 Order.</span></p>

It would appear they had each become dissatisfied with the 2016 Order over the years. They allowed this dissatisfaction to fester until it bubbled over at the start of 2023. Despite this, both parents seemed to come a long way in their oral evidence and the Court does not wish to undermine that progress in the content of this decision. The Court respects the compromises made by the parents and accepts the agreed aspects of the proposed Order. The Court is also mindful of the fact it should not become involved in the party’s petty disputes. The Court also has to give a reasoned decision. This decision is therefore limited to the matters the Court regards as fundamental to the overall decision it makes on the disputed issues.</span></p>

She had clearly formed a view on the facts. She struggled to answer questions asked of her. When asked about the Child’s view she would respond with her own.

She maintained it was wrong for Father to bring the figurine to the contact in July 2023, but could not say what the toy was. She was also unable to say why Father would want to upset the Child. She confirmed she had not spoken to Father about it, but said she felt Father had sufficient time to go to somewhere like Toys’R’Us to find a toy to excite the Child and his actions were deliberate. Her view was linked to Father being misleading over describing the Child as violent and lashing out. She sought to draw a distinction between this and Mother’s reports the Child was prone to outbursts and reacted disproportionately.</span></p>

The Father had already bought tickets for all the family, including the Child, to the Winter Wonderland and did not want him to miss this.

            <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">The Court takes account of the fact the Court suspended the Order when the case finally came before it in June 2023, but by then the damage had already been done. The Court also notes the view of the ISW that Mother had reasonable cause. However, the Court has sight of all of the evidence in this matter and the benefit of hearing both parents in evidence, which the ISW did not have. Reasonableness has an objective element. The Court does not accept it was reasonable for Mother to suspend contact when she did.</span></p>

            <p style="margin-left:0.25in"><span style="font-family:Tahoma">Wishes and feelings – Both parents report that the Child has told them different things about his name. Father says the Child wants the surname change, while the Mother says he does not. Father does not say the Child has told him he wants equal time with both parents, yet Father still pursues this as a long-term goal. The independent evidence before the Court is that the Child does not wish to have his name changed, or for there to be an increase in time with Father towards equal shared care. For a child caught between the parents an Order which gives the child the veto or power of determination, as suggested by Father, potentially places the child in a much worse position than before. There is also the problem of the parents then accepting that the child is genuinely stating what they want, if they feel able to do so despite wanting to make either or both parents happy. </span></p>

They have not been prioritised in the past, with failings by both parents. However, there is no such thing as a perfect parent. The issue is whether the parents have been able to appreciate how their behaviour has to change, before the Child suffers irreparable harm.</span></p>

The Child is on the first steps to reinstatement of the relationship with Father. It is important that is not taken too far too fast. Should he then be told to spend up to half of his time living with Father this may have a de-stabilising effect on him, as he may not have a clear picture of where he lives and is based. A change of surname is something that could also have a de-stabilising effect on him. He has spent the first 9 years of his life becoming accustomed to using his current name. Any change is unlikely to match those of his half-siblings, due to his unique parentage.</span></p>

The difficulty is that they both share parental responsibility and need to be able to work together. It is something the parties are to seek to improve. However, when considering the issue of name change the Court notes this is a Father who has shown commitment to the Child, has had good quality contact, in the main, and who shares parental responsibility with Mother.</span></p>

Arrangements need to be flexible in future, because they will need to change with time. This is because, as the Child grows up, there will be more demands on his time and what may be suitable for a 9 year-old may not be suitable for a 14 year-old. If the parents are unable to work together and to be flexible, prioritising the Child’s welfare in their decisions the Child will be caught in a straitjacket and the parents will keep returning to court.</span></p>

The Court is satisfied the Child’s wishes and feelings should be respected on this issue. The application to change the child’s surname is refused.</span></p>

There is a necessary corollary that the extended time in holidays would not be able to take place until this period had ended.</span></p>

Those issues revolve around the relationship between the parents. There is a reason why shared care does not automatically equate to an equal division of time, because it is not always appropriate. There is also acknowledged research supporting the emphasis on quality over quantity. The Court is not satisfied it is in the Child’s welfare interests to set out a progression plan which could be implemented in a years’ time to move towards 50:50. On current evidence 50:50 is Father’s aspiration and nothing more.</span></p>
