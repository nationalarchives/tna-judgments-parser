            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-weight:bold;font-family:Arial">This judgment is being handed down [in private] on 3 March 2023. It consists of 36 pages. The Judge has given permission for the judgment (and any of the facts and matters contained in it) to be published on condition that in any report, no person other than the advocates or the solicitors instructing them (and other persons identified by name in the judgment itself) may be identified by name, current address or location [including school or work place]. In particular the anonymity of the child and the adult members of their family must be strictly preserved. All persons, including representatives of the media, must ensure that these conditions are strictly complied with. Failure to do so will be a contempt of court. For the avoidance of doubt, the strict prohibition on publishing the names and current addresses of the parties and the child will continue to apply where that information has been obtained by using the contents of this judgment to discover information already in the public domain.</span></p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The matter proceeded as a remote hearing over 2 days via Teams although the mother declined to appear visually and chose to be telephoned in. She confirmed that this was her preference – she was alone at home with her younger child and she personally did not consider it appropriate for the cameras to be on in her home whilst that child was subject to a child protection plan. Mother stated that she had absolutely no other support network to assist her.</span></p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">It was clear that the mother had not made any attempt to prepare for the hearing. Indeed she has failed to engage properly throughout, showing scant regard for court orders and even penal notices. She had filed no final statement (indeed had filed no formal statements whatsoever, just some brief emails) and had no papers available to her and no assistance in caring for her other child. This hearing had been listed by my order of 3 October 2022 when the mother was present and listed by Teams at her request, with her camera turned off. My order of 10 January at the Pre Hearing Review specifically ordered the mother to file a witness statement by 24 January 2023 and provided guidance on how to do so. She had eventually prepared some “questions” for the experts in the form of an email, which were submitted and dealt with in writing.</span></p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The mother also had her young child present (…… months old). The court was informed that the child’s social worker had offered to provide support for the mother and the child so that she could concentrate on the court hearing. She failed to engage with this offer and indeed denied that it had been made.</span></p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">It is also important to note that the mother has not had the benefit of legal representation throughout this matter. Despite this she has been afforded every opportunity to engage and has been supported to represent herself. I am satisfied that if she had had legal representation the outcome would have been the same although she would have understood the process and likely outcome better had she received appropriate advice about the merits of her case from a solicitor or barrister.</span></p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The circumstances of the final hearing were accordingly not ideal. Despite this, the court and advocates for the father and the child made every effort to ensure that the mother’s position was properly put forward and the mother was given the opportunity to cross examine all parties. I gave opportunities for the mother to have breaks whenever needed and to prepare a statement to read as her evidence. I also arranged for the father and guardian’s closing submissions to be put in writing so that the mother could clearly see the nature of their case and prepare her response. The court is satisfied that all feasible and appropriate steps were taken to make the hearing fair and notes that the mother thanked the court for its assistance in presenting her case.</span></p>

Consequently, I would have concerns the mother may struggle to recognise and respond to her child’s emotional needs and have difficulties prioritizing those needs above her own.

It is evident from the assessment of Dr Alwin that mother still holds highly negative views of the father which have not altered and the ability of her to promote the relationship with the father is significantly limited. The child’s presentation is in line with this formulation as his mother is of the primary emotional importance to him and he is in my opinion well aware of mother’s feelings towards father and well aware of his sister’s feelings towards his father and may not be able to hold on to any positives he may feel or remember”. </span><span style="font-family:Arial">(page 285)</span></p>

This is amply evidenced by her original disappearance, denial of paternity, failure to attend many court hearings or engage in DNA testing which led to my making a declaration of parentage, failure to comply with orders and penal notices, failure to file statements, failure to travel for contact, failure to provide proof of any changes she claims, lack of acceptance of the truth of her allegations against the father being dismissed and maintaining and repeating them, accusing the psychologists of being liars and failing to engage with a plethora of support which has been offered throughout this case. </span></p>
