However, he was still “at high risk of displaying further harmful sexual behaviours if left in a risky situation”. Her objective has been to reduce those risks to “medium”.

Another girl was the victim of sexual assault, including anal rape at the same time, this all happened at the victim’s home. There was then sexual touching and oral rape of another boy in the same home. Later another boy was engaged in a consensual relationship of sexual touch and oral sex.

The victim is likely to be of a similar age to him, no more than 3 years difference, but vulnerable individuals would be at greater risk regardless of age. The nature of such harmful sexual behaviour is likely to be due to a need to increase his self-worth, to remove negative mood states or sexual satisfaction. In regard to severity of harm, the psychological harm and physical harm to the victim would be expected to be high. The imminence of his risk is likely when ZX is experiencing heightened low self-worth, alongside experiencing a negative mood state or is seeking sexual release. This imminence is likely to escalate if he is struggling to manage his negative mood state.

It establishes the presumption of capacity (sub-s 2) and the obligation to ensure that a person is not to be regarded as lacking capacity to make a decision until “all practicable steps to help him to do so have been taken without success” (sub-s 3).  P making an unwise decision does not mean he lacks capacity (sub-s 4) (at least not without more). Finally, any act done, or decision made on P’s behalf where he lacks capacity must be made or done in his best interests (sub-s 5). Sub-section 6 states the principle of least restriction.</span></p>

Let us assume P does not understand his need for care, but is able to choose between two properties which provide him with that care but are in different places.

If P’s disinhibition with members of the public is a reason to conclude he lacks capacity over contact, how could he have capacity to consent to sexual relations if that same disinhibition may lead to him ignoring their right to refuse/withdraw their consent to sexual relations? The answer is that there needs to be a justification for distinguishing between the two closely related decisions. If there is no justification, but P is found to have capacity in respect of sexual relations but not in respect of contact, then the Court is in danger of falling into a silo, as it were.

In that case a young married woman was found to lack capacity in relation to contact with others, because she was apparently wholly incapable of assessing the risk they posed to her. However, she was found to have capacity to consent to sexual relations. Earlier in the proceedings Peter Jackson, J. had found that she satisfied the pre-JB test for capacity in that area (i.e. (1)(3),(4) and (5) of the JB factors)- it is highly likely she would have satisfied (2) as well if assessed at the time). </span></p>

LC lacked the capacity to make decisions about contact with men because of “</span><span style="font-family:Garamond;color:#000000">an obsessional interest which was sexual in motivation in relation to men. This it requires to be said, in unambiguous terms, is a feature of her Autism” [3]. This led to what Hayden, J, somewhat euphemistically referred to as her behaviour being “‘socially inappropriate’…….when she is out in the community”. As a result, LC lacked capacity in relation to contact. However, she did not lack capacity to consent to sexual relations. Care planning for her was extremely challenging for the LA as is clearly outlined in that case.</span></p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">It seems to me the state of the law is clear. When making assessments of a person’s mental capacity concerning decisions across a range of domains, the Court (and any assessor, for that matter) must strike a balance between treating each domain as a distinct area of assessment without taking into account other domains ( the “silo” error) on the one hand, but on the other, approaching the assessment in such a general manner, taking into account too many diffuse issues, leading the assessor to lose sight of what is being assessed. Being stuck in a silo represents overly strict rigidity. The opposite however leads to flexibility that verges on arbitrariness. The former leads to extremely difficult management issues for P’s carers and care planners. The latter leads to a large number of people with difficulties in decision making in one area being found to lack capacity in others when they may not need to. The burden is on the assessor to strike a properly reasoned balance.</span></p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Garamond">I would take this argument further when dealing with capacity to engage in sexual relations. By placing capacity to engage in sexual activity away from most other decision making domains by removing the possibility of a decision being made on behalf of P, Parliament has created its own statutory silo. By placing the threshold so low, as the caselaw does, the assessor is directed to ensure factors that would be relevant to one decision making area (such as contact, for instance) may not be relevant to sexual relations. This appears to be what Hayden, J. is referring to in the LC case.</span></p>

Universally I would say, ZX does not weigh the medium, long term, not within those precise seconds, he doesn’t weigh the consequences of his actions across all domains, therefore based on evidence in the bundle, based on likelihood of unlikely to understand and use and weigh, sexual relations in the moment, where heightened level, make capacitous decisions and reasons there, is illogical</span></p>

However, I am satisfied that I understand his conclusion and how he reached it. ZX has thought a lot about sexual activity during his life. This may be due to early trauma, or perhaps ongoing trauma throughout his childhood. There is compelling evidence in the papers that he has been engaged in sexual activity throughout much of his life, often a victim but also a perpetrator of significant sexual abuse on other people and animals. There appears to be something of a sadistic excitement associated with coercive sex recorded at times. The risk of sexually offending, probably with a vulnerable person, either a female or male a little younger than him is still significant. </span></p>

However, Dr Ince is concerned that because of mental disorders, particularly ADHD, he is impulsive, and that impulsivity is something that removes from him the ability to use and weigh the information he understands in the moment. In other words, during sexual activity, if the partner does not give, or withdraws consent to carry on, ZX might be unable, because of his mental disorder, to make a decision about whether to carry on or not. </span></p>

I see in ZX a young man who is cunning and opportunistic but is also capable of planning sexual contact with other people within the context of such liaisons being forbidden. Hence the reference made about his waiting until adults are out of the way before initiating sexual contacts.</span></p>

In other words, the Court has no evidence of what ZX does or would do when confronted with the absence or withdrawal of consent during sexual activity.  </span></p>

First, there is a good deal of evidence from ZX himself and his brother that he has engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with other people over the years. Secondly, Ms France-Hayhurst would invite the Court not to allow ZX to engage in activity that provides an evidence base, at the expense of ZX’s liberty and the devastating experiences of his victims.</span></p>

I am extremely concerned about doing so. It seems to me this is an hormonal 18 year old man with a considerable sexual appetite. If I conclude he lacks the capacity to engage in sexual activity, he will be subjected to an extremely restrictive regime where his only sexual “outlet” will be masturbation whilst watching selected on-line pornography; censored, I would imagine, to avoid images of violent rape, children and animals.</span></p>

I must not tailor my formulation of the capacity assessment to ensure a particular outcome. Normally, that means trying to protect a vulnerable person who would otherwise be exploited or harmed unless protective measures can be put in place. Here, the same applies except it is ZX’s potential as a perpetrator in a serious sexual offence, and the consequences that flow for him, rather than his potential victim is what he is being protected against. </span></p>
