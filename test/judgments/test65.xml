The claims are made in 6 separate actions in respect of business interruption (“BI”) losses allegedly suffered by a number of different policyholders. Following directions given at a case management conference in December 2022, the claim by London International Exhibition Centre PLC against 6 insurers is the lead action. The claimant in that action owns and operates a very large and well-known exhibition and venue space in east London, and this is commonly known as the Excel Centre, and I will use the name “Excel” to refer to that claimant and the lead action. The insurers in that action are the Royal &amp; Sun Alliance Insurance PLC (“RSA”), which led the relevant policy, and a following market comprising 5 other well-known insurers. </p>

Apart from PizzaExpress, all of the other claimants in the various proceedings operate from a single premises, albeit that in Excel’s case the premises are very large. Apart from Excel and PizzaExpress, all the claimants are small or relatively small businesses. In the “Hairlab” proceedings, there is a hairdresser and two gyms: Hairlab Ltd, Muscleworks Ltd and Bodylines Ltd. The “Mayfair” proceedings, brought by Mayfair Banqueting Ltd, concern a London nightclub. The “Kaizen” proceedings are brought by 2 small restaurants and a café: Kaizen Cuisine Ltd (t/a Kaizen Cuisine), My Time Fine Fair Ltd (t/a My Time) and Umberto’s Restaurant Ltd (t/a Umberto’s). The “Why Not Bar” proceedings are brought by Why Not Bar and Lounge Limited, a bar and nightclub. There are various different insurer defendants to those proceedings as is apparent from the heading to this judgment. </p>

Under the relevant legal framework in the various nations of the United Kingdom, Covid-19 became a notifiable disease (i.e. that needed to be reported to the relevant authorities) on dates in February and March 2020. Some policies contain a definition of a “notifiable disease”: see section B below, and Appendix 1 hereto, where the material clauses of the policies are set out.</p>

The precise formulation of the issues in each action is set out in Section H of this judgment. The central (albeit not exclusive) question across the test cases is the same. That is whether ‘at the premises’ or “ATP” disease cover entails the same approach to proximate causation as the disease covers considered by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">Financial Conduct Authority v Arch Insurance (UK) Ltd </span>[2021] UKSC 1, [2021] AC 649 on appeal from the decision of the Divisional Court (Flaux LJ and Butcher J) [2020] EWHC 2448 (Comm) (“the <span style="font-style:italic">FCA test case</span>”).

The policies considered by the Supreme Court in the <span style="font-style:italic">FCA test case</span> (whose material terms are set out in Appendix 2 hereto) provided cover in respect of occurrences which were not confined to the premises of the policyholder, but extended to a radius around the premises or to events in the vicinity of the premises. A central question is whether this makes a material difference to the causation analysis. This issue is addressed in Section D below.</p>

In contrast, those BI claims that have reached judgment have been concerned with either ‘radius’ disease cover or some other insured peril, such as prevention of access. </p>

The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. Another person can then contract the virus when infectious particles that pass through the air are inhaled at short range (this is often called short-range aerosol or short-range airborne transmission) or if infectious particles come into direct contact with the eyes, nose, or mouth (droplet transmission). The virus can also spread in poorly ventilated and/or crowded indoor settings, where people tend to spend longer periods of time. This is because aerosols can remain suspended in the air or travel farther than conversational distance (this is often called long-range aerosol or long-range airborne transmission). People may also become infected when touching their eyes, nose or mouth after touching surfaces or objects that have been contaminated by the virus.</p>

The Divisional Court decided that because BI losses were caused by restrictions introduced in response to the pandemic in the UK as a whole rather than in any particular localised area, coverage could only be available if, on their proper construction, disease clauses provided cover against the effects of the pandemic in the whole of the UK. It decided that all disease clauses apart from QBE 2 and QBE 3 did provide cover. It held that the QBE 2 and QBE 3 clauses only provided cover in respect of disease within a radius of 1 or 25 miles of the premises, and those clauses did not indemnify a policyholder against BI losses consequent upon regulations introduced to deal with the national pandemic. The “but for” test for causation defeated the claims under those policies.</p>

Consequently, an analysis of causation was essential. On the basis of its consideration of causation, as a matter of construction of the policies in question, infectious diseases occurring within the relevant radius were a concurrent cause of the closures and restrictions, and the consequent BI losses, along with all the other infectious diseases elsewhere in the UK. The minority of the Supreme Court (Lord Hodge DPSC and Lord Briggs JSC) agreed with the causation analysis of the majority, but would also have upheld coverage on a wider basis similar to the reasoning of the Divisional Court.</p>

Instead, the clause should be read as meaning that there is cover:</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, in paragraphs [103] – [104], the Divisional Court referred to the “implications of the fact that the cover relates to occurrences of a Notifiable Disease”. The court referred to the legislative scheme for notifying diseases, and to the broad range of diseases which were notifiable as well as the coverage under RSA 3 (which is replicated in the cases which I am considering) for diseases to be added to the list:</p>
            <block name="embeddedStructure">

                    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.5in">“[103] The relevant scheme for notification, as mentioned above, is contained in the 1984 Act and the 2010 Regulations. Under the 2010 Regulations, registered medical practitioners have a duty to notify proper officers of the relevant local authority, amongst other things, of grounds for suspecting that a patient has a notifiable disease. Under the same Regulations, the relevant local authority must disclose the fact of a notification of a notifiable disease to, amongst others, PHE [Public Health England], and to the proper officer of the local authority in whose area the patient usually resides, if different. At the time of the conclusion of the contracts of insurance in question, there were some 31 diseases specified in schedule 1 to the 2010 Regulations as notifiable, including cholera, plague, typhus, yellow fever and SARS. Under RSA 3, furthermore, the cover in Extension vii is not limited to Notifiable Diseases which have been included on schedule 1 at the outset of the insurance, but extends to others which may be added thereto, as Covid-19 has been.”</p>

              <embeddedStructure>
                <level>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.5in">“[104] While there is clearly a spectrum of diseases within the category of Notifiable Diseases, it includes diseases which are capable of widespread dissemination, such as SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), which is a viral respiratory illness caused by the SARS-associated coronavirus for which there is no vaccine. It is in the nature of human infectious and contagious diseases that they may spread in highly complicated, often difficult to predict, and what might be described as “fluid”, patterns. Furthermore, the list of diseases includes some which might attract a response from authorities which are not merely local authorities, and which is not a purely local response. The requirement under the Regulations of notifications to PHE, and to other local authorities facilitates such wider responses. Moreover, in terms of Extension vii, the fact that it is envisaged that the occurrence of a notifiable disease up to 25 miles away might be followed by interruption of business at the insured’s premises demonstrates, in our view, that the parties must have contemplated that there might be relevant actions of public authorities which affect a wide area. They must also have contemplated that the authorities might take action in relation to the outbreak of a notifiable disease as a whole, and not to particular parts of an outbreak, and would be most unlikely to take action which had any regard to whether cases fell within or outside a line 25 miles away from any particular insured premises.”</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In relation to those clauses which provided coverage, the Divisional Court also applied a causation analysis which led to the same conclusion, albeit that it regarded this as “less satisfactory”:</p>
            <block name="embeddedStructure">
              <embeddedStructure>
                <level>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.5in">“[112] Alternatively, although we regard this as being less satisfactory, each of the individual occurrences was a separate but effective cause. On this analysis they were all effective because the authorities acted on a national level, on the basis of the information about all the occurrences of Covid-19, and it is artificial to say that only some of those which had occurred by any given date were effective causes of the action taken at that date; and still more artificial to say that because the action was taken in response to all the cases, it could not be regarded as taken in response to any particular cases. As Mr Edelman QC submitted, there is material in the agreed facts which provides a sufficient basis for this analysis. He pointed to the information which the government was acting upon, and a number of SAGE minutes, which show that the government response was the reaction to information about all the cases in the country, and that the response was decided to be national because the outbreak was so widespread. As Mr Edelman QC pointed out, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Mr Hancock, on 28 April 2020 stated that thought had been given to imposing measures first on London and the Midlands, but it had been decided that “we are really in this together”, and that “the shape of the curve … has been very similar across the whole country”. Given this, it appears to us that it is not unrealistic to say that all the cases were equal causes of the imposition of national measures.”</p>

The basis for this conclusion is the analysis of the court below, which in our opinion is correct, that each of the individual cases of illness resulting from COVID-19 which had occurred by the date of any Government action was a separate and equally effective cause of that action (and of the response of the public to it). Our conclusion does not depend on the particular terminology used in the clause to describe the required causal connection between the loss and the insured peril and applies equally whether the term used is "following" or some other formula such as "arising from" or "as a result of". It is a conclusion about the legal effect of the insurance contracts as they apply to the facts of this case.”</p>

The court agreed that it was important that the relevant clause did not confine cover to business interruption resulting <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">only</span> from cases of notifiable disease within the 25-mile radius, as opposed to cases elsewhere. This was “an important point when considering questions of causation”: [72]. In relation to the second “fundamental” matter, the Supreme Court said:</p>

But again, the significance of those matters, in our view, is in relation to questions of causation. They cannot justify extending the geographical scope of the cover beyond the area clearly specified in the policy.

At paragraphs [171] – [176], the court considered various authorities, including insurance cases, concerning concurrent causes. In paragraphs [175] – [176], the court referred to causes which operate in combination to bring about a loss. As set out in paragraph [176], quoted above, the court said that a concurrent cause analysis could be applied to multiple causes which act in combination to bring about a loss.

The court agreed at paragraph [181] that in the vast majority of cases prior event X would not be regarded as the cause of subsequent event Y, if Y would have occurred anyway. However, that analysis did not always apply, for reasons which the court explained in some detail. At paragraph [190] – [191], the court said that:</p>

It must always depend on the context in which the question is asked. Where the context is a claim under an insurance policy, judgements of fault or responsibility are not relevant. All that matters is what risks the insurers have agreed to cover. We have already indicated that this is a question of contractual interpretation which must accordingly be answered by identifying (objectively) the intended effect of the policy as applied to the relevant factual situation.</p>

It seems incontrovertible that in the examples we have given there is a causal connection between the event and the loss. Whether that causal connection is sufficient to trigger the insurer's obligation to indemnify the policyholder depends on what has been agreed between them.”</p>

It described the two competing arguments, namely the FCA’s concurrent cause analysis (which had been accepted by the Divisional Court in relation to some policy wordings) and the insurers’ argument for a “but for” test or alternatively “if that contention is rejected, that a single case of disease or a relatively small number of cases of disease occurring within the specified radius is not sufficient to satisfy the causal requirement required by the policy”. It was common ground that the central reasoning of the Supreme Court was contained in the following paragraphs, to which frequent reference was made at the hearing before me:</p>

The parties to the insurance contracts may be presumed to have known that some infectious diseases - including, potentially, a new disease (like SARS) - can spread rapidly, widely and unpredictably. It is obvious that an outbreak of an infectious disease may not be confined to a specific locality or to a circular area delineated by a radius of 25 miles around a policyholder's premises. Hence no reasonable person would suppose that, if an outbreak of an infectious disease occurred which included cases within such a radius and was sufficiently serious to interrupt the policyholder's business, all the cases of disease would necessarily occur within the radius. It is highly likely that such an outbreak would comprise cases both inside and outside the radius and that measures taken by a public authority which affected the business would be taken in response to the outbreak as a whole and not just to those cases of disease which happened to fall within the circumference of the circle described by the radius provision.</p>

Not only would this potentially give rise to intractable counterfactual questions but, more fundamentally, it seems to us contrary to the commercial intent of the clause to treat uninsured cases of a notifiable disease occurring <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">outside</span> the territorial scope of the cover as depriving the policyholder of an indemnity in respect of interruption also caused by cases of disease which the policy is expressed to cover. We agree with the FCA's central argument in relation to the radius provisions that the parties could not reasonably be supposed to have intended that cases of disease outside the radius could be set up as a countervailing cause which displaces the causal impact of the disease inside the radius. </p>

As leading counsel for the FCA, Mr Edelman, pointed out, to apply a "but for" test in a situation where cases of disease inside and outside the radius are concurrent causes of business interruption loss would give the insurer similar protection to that which it would have had if loss caused by any occurrence of a notifiable disease outside the specified radius had been expressly excluded from cover. If the insurers had wished to impose such an exclusion, it was incumbent on them to include it in the terms of the policy. </p>

The insurers argued that the correct approach was to aggregate all the cases of disease falling within the scope of the policy, and “to ask whether those cases, taken together, had an equal or similar causal impact when compared with the aggregate impact of all the cases of disease not covered by the policy”. The Supreme Courtrejected this approach as well. The Supreme Courtnoted that each case of illness sustained as a result of Covid-19 was a separate peril and thus potentially a separate cause of loss [199]. At paragraph [200], however, the Supreme Court said:</p>

We would accept that the language of the policies is not inconsistent with an interpretation whereby, when cases of disease combine to cause loss, an insured occurrence of disease is not to be regarded as a proximate cause unless the other insured cases of disease with which it has combined, taken together, are of similar causal potency as any uninsured cases of disease (also viewed together). We do not consider, however, that this interpretation is one that makes commercial sense of the disease clauses” (My emphasis, and I will return to the significance of the underlined words).</p>

This accords with the presumed intention of the parties to an insurance product sold principally to SMEs and often with relatively low financial limits. (For example, under MSA 1 the maximum payable for any one loss is £100,000.) It also accords with the desire for certainty manifest in the definition of cover by reference to a specific radius of 25 miles (or one mile) of the insured premises.</p>

It is therefore sufficient to say that, in paragraphs [214] – [249], the Supreme Court also applied a very similar concurrent cause (rather than a “but for”) analysis to the questions that it was addressing in those paragraphs. For example, in paragraph [240], the Supreme Courtsaid that where the causal chain specified in the Hiscox 4 wording referred to an occurrence within a mile of the insured premises, the “disease is very likely to have occurred elsewhere”. The originating cause of that disease was the global Covid-19 pandemic. The policy did not exclude loss arising from the global pandemic, and other concurrent effects of the pandemic on an insured business did not reduce the indemnity under the relevant clause. A similar concurrent cause analysis was contained, for example, in paragraphs [247] and [249].</p>

In the course of those reasons, the minority reiterated points made by the majority, for example:</p>

Both the FOS decision and the Lord Mance arbitration award have the benefit of having been reached after substantial adversarial arguments, so that the decision-maker could see both sides of the case.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Scorey submitted that there are important differences between radius clauses (whether covering 1 mile or 25 miles) and ATP clauses. Most obviously, the former cover a potentially wide geographical area involving disparate properties and people; in contrast, ATP clauses are focussed myopically upon the specific premises in question. These differences lead inevitably to the conclusion that: (i) the scope and nature of cover intended to be provided by radius clauses is inherently very different from that intended to be provided by ATP clauses; and (ii) the exceptional principle of concurrent causation which was applied in the <span style="font-style:italic">FCA test case </span>in relation to radius clauses can have no application to ATP clauses, either as a matter of principle, or as a result of the language of such clauses.

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">First, ATP clauses cover restrictions which are in response to cases of disease actually occurring at the premises and not elsewhere. Under an ATP clause, cases of disease at a neighbouring property are irrelevant if the premises covered is not infected. By contrast, radius clauses are concerned with the consequences of disease occurring away from the premises, including some considerable distance away where there is a 25 mile radius. ATP clauses therefore cover the most limited, circumscribed and localised of risks.</p>

          <content>
            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, in the context of ATP cover, all elements of the insured peril (i.e. disease, restrictions imposed and interruption) concern the insured premises alone. The place from which the policyholder carries on business is likely to be the key source or site of the disease, and the risk that is sought to be averted is that the insured premises continues to produce that disease or that it spreads away from the premises and to others. The restrictions envisaged by the clause, and which are likely to give rise to the contemplated business interruption, are therefore directed specifically at the premises to stop the production or spread of the disease. The clause does not, naturally or at all, contemplate measures taken on a national or wide area basis, responding to disease everywhere without any specific regard to, and irrespective of, the cases of disease at the premises.</p>

          <content>
            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, and consequently, by agreeing insurance for occurrences of a notifiable disease at the premises, the parties did not necessarily contemplate occurrences of disease away from the premises and the consequences of widespread disease. ATP cover is necessarily directed at restrictions imposed in response to – and to address – specific incidents of disease at the Premises.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Fourthly, by contrast radius clauses expressly contemplate non-local occurrences of disease away from any specific premises. This disease has nothing to do with the premises itself, save for location within the defined geographical radius. Nevertheless, it impacts the policyholder’s business, most likely as a result of relevant authority action taken over a wide area. The risk posed by such distant disease lies in the nature of notifiable infectious diseases and their propensity to spread rapidly, widely and unpredictably through close human-to-human contact. The restrictions envisaged by a radius clause and the likely basis for the business interruption are not, therefore, premises-specific or insured-specific restrictions, but instead are general restrictions in the form of public health orders aimed at stopping or reducing the spread of disease in the wider community both within and without the relevant radius.</p>

          <content>
            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Fifthly, radius clauses necessarily contemplate occurrences of disease not just within the specified radius but also out of it; i.e. a wide area disease outbreak. They also contemplate authority action over a large geographical area responding generally to such a widespread outbreak.</p>

          <content>
            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Sixthly, in the context of a wide area infectious disease outbreak / epidemic, one would anticipate ATP clauses and radius clauses to address the risk presented at different stages of the outbreak / epidemic. The premises-specific risk contemplated by an ATP clause is most likely to manifest itself during the early stages of the outbreak, with premises-specific measures being implemented to prevent the spread of disease beyond the sites of infection and into the wider public. If those measures fail, and the disease spreads across a widespread area attracting generalised and unspecific government action, ATP clauses will no longer be relevant. Instead, it is a radius clause which will be triggered and will provide relevant cover.</p>

          <content>
            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thus, the nature of the cover provided by ATP clauses is fundamentally and qualitatively different from that provided by radius clauses. In particular, the fortuity contemplated by ATP clauses is business interruption caused by restrictions imposed on the premises in response to and directly targeting specific incidents of disease at a precise location. A radius clause provides cover for more indirect causation. An ATP clause envisages a direct, conventional, causal connection, requiring proof of ‘but for’ causation, between occurrences of disease at the premises, authority action, and business interruption and loss.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There were a number of situations where this could be proved. A straightforward case was an individual occurrence of disease, for example food poisoning or Legionnaire’s disease, at only the specific insured premises, leading to a closure of the premises by the authorities. An outbreak of disease in a localised area, with occurrences of the disease at more than one premises, could lead to closure of each location where there had been an occurrence of disease, in response to those occurrences. Even on a national scale, there could be coverage: if the authorities instructed particular premises to close and/or clean, where occurrences of disease have been reported at such premises. The coverage in respect of notifiable diseases was therefore in respect of occurrences at the Premises itself, and business interruption resulting from restrictions specifically targeted at those occurrences.</p>

Instead, those insurers relied upon much of the reasoning advanced by Mr Scorey in the context of “but for” causation: in his oral submissions, Mr Kealey KC referred specifically to the principal sections of Mr Scorey’s written argument. However, the end-point of the argument was different: it did not lead to “but for” causation, but rather to the requirement that causation had to be (as Mr Kealey put it) direct, distinct, palpable and discernible. Although these adjectives have different shades of meaning, I shall refer to the “distinct” causation test as encompassing all of them. Mr Kealey said that this test involved asking whether the outbreak of the disease at the premises had a meaningful causal significance because of what had happened at the premises.</p>

The case of disease must therefore cause the authorities to take action and for the premises to be closed. In his oral reply submissions, Mr Kealey made it clear that he was not advocating a “but for” test, and that his submission as to the applicable test accepted the possibility of concurrent causes in certain situations. This was because he accepted that the action of the authorities might be a response not only to the occurrence at the premises, but also a response to occurrences at other premises, and that the parties would have appreciated that. However, it did not follow that (what he described as) the diluted causative link, applied by the Supreme Court, was sufficient to establish causation.  </p>

The Supreme Court has considered the question of causation in the context of the very same Covid-19 pandemic with which I am concerned.

Each of them refers to the premises of the policyholders. It is true that the <span style="font-style:italic">FCA test case</span> clauses contained this reference in the context of “radius” clauses. However, two of the clauses in the <span style="font-style:italic">FCA test case</span> expressly applied to occurrences which were both “at the premises” and within the relevant radius, and there was no suggestion by the Supreme Court that a different causation test applied to these two aspects of the clause. Indeed, as discussed below, a clause which simply covers occurrences within a radius will encompass, even if it does not say so expressly, occurrences at the premises: in other words, the radius will start at the centre of the premises rather than at their perimeter.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">First, the mere fact that a radius clause and an “at the premises” clause are differently worded does not, of course, mean that the reasoning of the Supreme Court is inapplicable. Equally, I accept the insurers’ point that the reasoning of the Supreme Court cannot be transposed unthinkingly from a radius clause to an “at the premises” clause. As the insurers repeatedly emphasised, the applicable causation test is ultimately a question of the construction of the relevant contract.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Secondly, it is also clear from the nature of the issue under consideration, as well as from the analysis of the Supreme Court, that the construction issue that arises in relation to causation cannot be approached, as one approaches some issues of contract interpretation, on the basis of one’s first impressions of the wording of the relevant clause. The insurers placed considerable emphasis on the use of the words “at the premises”, and other language which referred expressly to the premises. They argued that, as a matter of language, the clause was concerned with matters which were premises-specific. The insurers were not covering anything that occurred outside the premises. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In my view, however, this argument deflected attention from the real issue under consideration. The policyholders did not suggest that the cover provided was for anything other than occurrences at the premises. They could not do so, in the light of the decision of the Supreme Court as to the nature of the peril insured against: the Supreme Court rejected the analysis of the Divisional Court which, in relation to some policies, had identified the relevant peril as being the pandemic as a whole. Thus, the policyholders fairly accepted that the cover, in an “at the premises” wording, was highly localised: i.e. it applied only to occurrences at the premises. In that respect they submitted, and I agree, that it was a more highly localised form of coverage than a 1-mile radius clause, albeit that such a clause could itself also be described as localised and certainly far more localised than a 25-mile radius clause.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The important question, however, does not concern the highly localised nature of the peril insured against. Rather, it concerns the approach to causation in circumstances where the impact on the policyholder’s business is the result of the combination of a large number of individual events, one of which is the occurrence at the premises which is (assuming that it can be proved) in principle a covered occurrence. I do not consider that any amount of emphasising the words “at the premises”, or similar wording, provides an answer to the question of how to approach causation in circumstances where the loss is the result of a combination of multiple events. It was that issue that the Supreme Court addressed in the context of radius clauses, and the answer was that a “concurrent cause” approach to causation was applicable; so that the covered event or events within the radius were, in combination with a very large number of uncovered events of a similar nature outside the radius, all effective causes of the policyholder’s loss, thereby grounding an ability to recover under the policy.</p>

As described in Section C above, the insurers there advanced two arguments, both rejected by the Supreme Court, whose substance was that cover was confined to the impact of covered occurrences within the radius. The first argument was the “but for” analysis: the insurers contended that the policyholder’s losses would have been suffered even if there had been no occurrence within the radius, because Covid-19 was so widespread and the lockdown would have happened anyway. This was an argument which focused on the occurrences within the radius,and asserted their causal irrelevance. The second argument, referred to by the Supreme Court as the “weighing approach”, was similarly based upon the contention that the only covered occurrences were those within the radius, and that the correct approach was to weigh the relative impact of those occurrences within the radius by comparison with those outside. </p>

If, therefore, a policyholder with a radius clause could establish the existence of an occurrence within the relevant radius of its policy, there could be recovery for the consequences of the closure of its premises resulting from the pandemic as a whole. This was because the occurrence within the radius was an insured peril, and that occurrence was sufficiently causative of the loss, applying the concurrent cause analysis. Although the policy did only extend to occurrences within the radius, it was no answer, applying a but for test, for the insurer to say that the consequences of the pandemic would have occurred irrespective of the occurrence within the radius, because the vast number of other cases of Covid-19 would have caused the policyholder’s loss anyway. Nor was it an answer that the relative impact of cases outside the radius was much greater than the impact of cases within the radius.</p>

Those arguments failed, notwithstanding the very clear wordings which referred to the radius, and nothing elsewhere, and notwithstanding that the peril insured under a “radius” cover was confined to occurrences within the radius.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Against this background, the insurers need to show, as they sought to argue, that cover which is confined to occurrences “at the premises” is indeed something fundamentally different to cover which extends to occurrences within a given radius, however small that radius might be, with the consequence that a completely different causation test should be applied to the former as compared to the latter. The insurers submitted that there were fundamental differences, or as one insurer submitted, “at the premises” clauses and radius clauses are “chalk and cheese”. This argument requires consideration of the reasons which led to the Supreme Court, in the context of radius clauses, to reach the conclusion that a concurrent effective cause was sufficient for coverage, and thence to the question of whether their reasoning can be read across into “at the premises” wordings. I address this below.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As the argument in the case developed, it was accepted by the parties that a clause which covered occurrences within a given radius would apply equally to occurrences which were at the premises themselves as well as occurrences beyond their perimeter but within the radius. In other words, the radius would spread outwards from the centre of the premises, and therefore apply to occurrences within it, rather than starting at the perimeter of the premises so as only to be applicable to occurrences outside. I have no doubt that this is the correct approach, and that therefore clauses which refer to occurrences “at the premises” and also within a given radius of the premises, involve an element of duplication or surplusage. However, surplusage is very familiar in commercial contracts, and an argument of construction based on surplusage is often regarded as weak. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In this sense, therefore, there is a clear geographical link between a radius clause and an “at the premises” clause. The radius of the former starts at the centre of the premises themselves, and therefore provides cover in respect of occurrences therein, but also the perils insured extend to those which are outside thereby making it potentially easier for the policyholder to establish the existence of a covered peril. The latter also starts at the centre of the premises, but stops at their perimeter.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Some of the clauses referred to by the Supreme Court in its judgment also contain another, and close, geographical link to the premises. The widest area covered by those clauses was a 25-mile radius, and therefore included a very large area some distance from the premises. Declaration 8 made by the Supreme Court identified this area as 1963.5 square miles. However, other clauses covered occurrences within a 1-mile radius. This is obviously a closer geographical connection: it covers an area of 3.4 square miles around the premises, nearly 600 times smaller than the area of a 25-mile radius. On one view, an area of 3.4 square miles can be considered to be quite a large area, particularly if it is in a city, as the insurers pointed out in their submissions. But it is also possible to consider it to be a smallish localised area, as indeed the Hiscox insurers submitted to the Supreme Court in the <span style="font-style:italic">FCA test case</span>. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Ultimately, as many of the insurers accepted in their submissions, the answer to the causation question in relation to the (alleged) difference between radius and ATP cover cannot depend on the size of the radius specified in a radius clause. Indeed, by the end of the hearing, the submissions made by a number of insurers expressly acknowledged that the size of the radius, in the sense of the width of the circle which spreads out from the central point (the premises) did not matter. Thus, there did not come a point where, under a radius clause, the causation test switched from the concurrent effective cause test established by the Supreme Court and became something else, for example the “but for” or “distinct cause” test. It was thus accepted that even if the radius was smaller than 1 mile – for example the 250 metre radius provided for in some policies that Mr Gruder KC made available at the hearing – the Supreme Court test was applicable. </p>

My present view is that in paragraph [250] of its judgment, the Supreme Court was saying that, in the context of NDDA (Non-Damage Denial of Access) clauses, its causation approach applied to clauses which covered occurrences which occurred “in the vicinity of the premises”.  “Vicinity” is a concept with a degree of elasticity, and the absence of a clearly defined boundary provides room for argument, unavailable in a clear radius clause, as to where the vicinity ends. However, the Divisional Court in the <span style="font-style:italic">FCA test case</span> considered that “vicinity” in ordinary usage connoted neighbourhood, the area surrounding or in the neighbourhood of the premises in question: see paragraphs [436], [444] and [466]. This is obviously a very close geographical connection, and in many contexts (particularly urban contexts) will be far less than 1 mile. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There was some debate before me as to whether paragraph [250] of the Supreme Court judgment in the <span style="font-style:italic">FCA test case</span> should be read as applying the Supreme Court’s concurrent causation test to “vicinity” clauses, and this debate may resurface in a different context in preliminary issues which I am to hear later this year. In <span style="font-style:italic">Corbin &amp; King</span>, Cockerill J considered paragraph [250] and decided that the Supreme Court’s reasoning on causation did indeed apply to NDDA clauses which included vicinity wording. I have not been persuaded, at least on the arguments advanced at the present hearing, that her decision was wrong, and therefore I see no reason not to follow it. Paragraph [250] comes at the end of the causation section of the Supreme Court’s judgment, and it is natural to read this as applying to all that has gone before. Mr Scorey accepted that it was a reference back to paragraph [122] of the judgment, but submitted that it was simply addressing the second part of the causation analysis (i.e. the arguments principally concerning the “counterfactual” which were considered in paragraphs [218] – [249]). However, as Mr Gruder pointed out, this would be strange. The second part of the analysis would not arise for consideration unless the concurrent causation test, rather than the insurers’ ‘but for’ test had been applied.</p>

In so far as some insurers did not expressly accept this, no principled argument was advanced which identified the point at which the size of a radius would become so small that the Supreme Court’s reasoning would not apply, and indeed it is difficult to see how any such point could be identified. </p>

Many of the diseases on the list of notifiable diseases, existing at the time that the insurances were placed (i.e. in around 2019 or early 2020), were highly contagious and infectious. The Divisional Court had referred in paragraph [104] to the spectrum of diseases covered by the 2010 Regulations, including cholera, plague, typhus, yellow fever and SARS. It said that the spectrum included diseases “capable of widespread dissemination”,and referred specifically to SARS for which there was no vaccine.

The nature of the diseases covered is therefore the first point made in paragraph [194] of the majority judgment: i.e. that the parties would know that some infectious diseases, including potentially new diseases, can spread rapidly, widely and unpredictably, and that it was obvious that an “outbreak of an infectious disease may not be confined to a specific locality or to a circular area delineated by a radius of 25 miles around a policyholder’s premises”. The same point was made by Lord Briggs and Lord Hodge, who referred in paragraph [316] to a number of well-known notifiable diseases to which the relevant clauses applied, all of which were capable of spreading rapidly and widely “so as potentially to cause a threat to health on a national scale, and to threaten a national reaction by the responsible authorities, leading to business disruption on a national scale”.</p>

The diseases covered are the same, and so are their potential to be widespread and to call for a response which is not solely responsive to cases within the radius or the premises. The Supreme Court stated clearly that one would normally expect the cases of disease to combine and cause loss. That is again the case whether one is dealing with cases within a radius or cases “at the premises”. </p>

The important point was that if an occurrence of a disease at the edge of a 25-mile radius was to have an effect on the policyholder whose premises were 25 miles away, it was highly likely that the disease was very widespread and that it would be calling for a response over a very wide area, and that such response would be dealing with occurrences both inside and outside the relevant radius. However, the effect of the insurers’ argument was to deny coverage when there was a national pandemic. </p>

By contrast, with an “at the premises” clause, it is only an occurrence “at the premises” which is covered and which must therefore have the relevant impact.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I do not accept that this is a fundamental distinction which leads to a different test of causation. There was ultimately no dispute that the applicable radius can be shrunk considerably from the 25 miles being considered by the Supreme Court, without affecting the applicability of the causation test; for example, to 1 mile, 250 metres, to “in the vicinity”. Logically, it must follow that it can be shrunk to something close to vanishing point (say even 10 metres around the property). In my view, the Supreme Court’s discussion of the position of a 25-mile radius, and its impact on premises so far away, illustrates and highlights the first point referred to by the court, namely the nature of the diseases covered. I do not consider that this can lead to a radically different test of causation. Contrary to the submissions of the insurers, it is not the existence of the radius which means that there may be (as Mr Kealey described it) “non-premises specific wider area authority action”: it is the nature of the diseases which are covered. The existence of the radius thus illustrates and reinforces the fact that there may be wide area authority action, but it does not follow that such action is only contemplated where the policy provides for a radius.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is therefore no accident, and is not an omission in the Supreme Court’s reasoning, that there is no substantial discussion as to why the same causation approach applies whatever the size of the radius; i.e. whether the radius is 25 miles, 1 mile or the vicinity. It was not necessary for there to be an extended discussion, because the principle was the same and it arose from the nature of the diseases covered. Given that the radius can be shrunk from 25 miles, to 1 mile, to “the vicinity”, without making any difference to the causation analysis, there is no reason why it cannot be further shrunk from the vicinity of the premises to the premises itself. In such a case, as Mr Weitzman for PizzaExpress submitted, the “radius” would extend from the centre of the premises to the perimeter of the premises, although I would accept that it would not be usual to speak of a radius in that  context.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is in my view a further reason, apparent from the Supreme Court’s reasoning, why the radius can be shrunk very considerably without any impact on the causation analysis, and indeed more generally as to why the insurers’ submissions should be rejected. This is because, as the Supreme Court explained, the function of the radius clause is simply to define the geographical or territorial area in which the insured peril must occur. The concept of a geographical area covered by the policy, or a territorial scope of cover, or territorial limit is referred to in a number of places in the Supreme Court judgment: see [73], [86], [95], [175], [204], [205], [207], [212]. A policyholder who has purchased coverage for occurrences within a 25 mile radius will obviously find it easier, in most cases, to prove an occurrence than a policyholder whose coverage is only for occurrences at the premises. However, the 25 mile radius is, as is apparent from paragraphs [204] – [206] of the judgment, simply a line that has been drawn, for the purposes of contractual certainty, in order to define the territorial scope of the coverage. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The policyholders were therefore correct in their submission that “at the premises” is simply about the geographical or territorial scope of the coverage, and where the parties have chosen to draw the line in that respect. It has no impact on the appropriate approach to causation. Mr Gruder expressed essentially the same point in his submission that the principal difference in wording between a radius clause and the “at the premises” clauses is, on the proper construction of the policies, a matter of the insured peril, not a point that goes to causation. I agree with that submission as well.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The possibility that the radius can be shrunk very considerably from 25 miles to 1 mile or to the “vicinity” gives rise to a further difficulty in the insurers’ argument. In all of those situations, the insurers accept that the Supreme Court’s decision means that there is, in effect, coverage for the consequences of the national pandemic applying the concurrent causation test, provided that there is an occurrence within the relevant radius. However, as Mr Kramer pointed out, it is difficult to see why, particularly in the cases of a shrunken radius, the insurers’ “distinct” cause test could not be applied, if it had any validity at all. This is illustrated by the argument on behalf of the Hiscox insurers in the Supreme Court (see page 670 of the report at [2021] AC 649), viz; that notifiable diseases may be highly localised or confined and that a 1-mile limit was to ensure that only local events were covered. Since 1 mile radius clauses could be regarded as providing “localised” cover, the present “distinct” cause argument could have been advanced by the insurers in the Supreme Court case, but it was not.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thirdly, as explained in [196], the Supreme Court’s conclusion in paragraph [195] was reinforced by the fact that the relevant wordings did not confine cover to a situation where the interruption of the business resulted <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">only</span> from cases of disease within the radius. This point had been described by the Divisional Court as fundamental. The Supreme Court clearly took the same view. In paragraph [203], the court referred to the “fundamental objection” (both to the “but for” and the “weighing” approach) that it “sets up cases of disease occurring outside the territorial scope of the cover in competition with the occurrences of disease within its scope”. The Supreme Court referred to this point, again, at paragraph [211].</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There can in my view be no doubt that this “fundamental” point is equally applicable to “at the premises” clauses. All versions of the insurers’ argument in this case seek to disapply their coverage for occurrences within the territorial scope of the “at the premises” cover, by setting up the cases of disease outside that scope. I see no reason how it could be a fundamental point in relation to radius clauses, but could at the same time be inconsequential or relatively so in the context of “at the premises” clauses.  </p>

Whilst this is essentially the same point as the fact that cover was not confined to interruption resulting only from cases within the territorial scope, it is again a point which applies equally to the “at the premises” wording with which I am concerned.</p>

The court considered (see [195]) that the “but for” test gave rise to “intractable counterfactual questions”. In the present case, the insurers put forward a number of examples where, applying the “distinct” cause test of causation, there would be coverage. As further discussed below, the circumstances in which recovery would and would not arise were far from clear, and the distinctions drawn seemed artificial. The test proposed is on any view nothing like as simple and clear as the concurrent cause approach adopted by the Supreme Court. </p>

The Divisional Court and Supreme Court were looking at the same list of notifiable diseases, and reached the obvious conclusion that some (albeit not all) of them were highly contagious and could spread in ways that could not be anticipated. The policy coverage was in respect of all of the diseases, and was not a closed list: it included coverage for new diseases that might emerge, and which could therefore not be the subject of Mr Scorey’s biology lesson. The cover was not limited to Legionnaire’s disease or similar diseases which were likely to affect one or a handful of premises. The existence of successful vaccination programmes in respect of some diseases might mean that a substantial problem in respect of those diseases was unlikely to occur, but it does not eliminate the risk, and the purpose of insurance is to protect against the unexpected. In any event, it was not suggested that, at the time when the policy was placed, there was an effective vaccine for SARS (which was in fact specifically excluded under the PizzaExpress policy, but not the others). It obviously could not be suggested that effective vaccines existed for the unknown diseases which might be added to the list of notifiable diseases and which were also the subject of coverage.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The existence of clear cover against all notifiable diseases, including new – and potentially transmissible and dangerous infectious – diseases that might emerge in the future, also provides an answer to the insurers’ argument based on aspects of other perils covered by the policy wordings, for example the cover for vermin and defective sanitation. The insurers argued that this demonstrated the localised nature of the coverage provided by the “at the premises” wording. However, in my view this was really the “Legionnaire’s disease” argument in another form. It may be that some aspects of perils insured against were more likely to be very local problems. This does not, however, have the effect of restricting the cover that is provided against all notifiable including new diseases. The clauses considered by the Supreme Court, for example QBE 3, also covered vermin and/or defective sanitation, but this did not affect the Supreme Court’s causation analysis. Furthermore, the localised nature of the peril insured against, in the sense that it requires proof of a relevant occurrence “at the premises”, is not in dispute. But, as the Supreme Court decision makes clear, a narrowly defined insured peril does not, in a context such as the present, result in a restrictive approach to causation in circumstances where there is a combination of insured and uninsured perils.</p>

He submitted that any reasonable reader of the wording “any occurrence of a Notifiable Disease … at the Premises” would understand that the clause is concerned with disease which occurs at the premises and not with disease which occurs elsewhere and spreads to the premises. This proposition was also referred to in his “chalk and cheese” distinction between an ATP and a radius clause: the former is dealing with things which happen at the premises and may spread away from them, and a radius clause is concerned with things which happen away from the premises and may spread towards them. </p>

Indeed, on this analysis, cover would presumably be restricted to the first person (person zero) who suffered the contagious illness and the first premises visited by that person, since it could be said that every other instance of disease in all other premises was a result of the spread to those premises. </p>

It therefore cannot be said, as Mr Scorey submitted, that the place from which the policyholder carries on business is likely to be the key source or site of the disease. It may simply be one of very many places to which the disease has spread.</p>

An initial question is whether and the extent to which, this test differs, as a matter of substance, from the “but for” test, which was rejected by the Supreme Court. In his opening submissions, Mr Kealey argued that it was a different test, but that it would be useful to ask the question posed by the “but for” test and that this would usually provide the same answer as the application of the distinct cause test. It was never clear to me why it would be useful to consider “but for” causation in the context of the different test which was being proposed. As Mr Kealey’s argument developed, particularly in his reply submissions, it became clear that the test proposed was not a “but for” test at all, and that the proponents of this test ultimately accepted concurrent causation.

Where there was a closure of businesses everywhere, because of disease everywhere in the UK and irrespective of whether there happened to be a case of disease at the premises, then a reasonable person would not say that the premises were closed as a result of an outbreak or occurrence of disease at the premises. In that situation, the action by the authorities was not “targeted” at the disease at the premises, and there was no coverage.

This might be the case if, for instance, disease occurred at other locations on the ExCeL campus, as well as at the Premises, and the authorities ordered the closure of both the campus and the Premises.”</p>

The 5 nurseries, where measles had been discovered, and which had been closed down, would all be able to claim under their policies. The “but for” test would not apply in these circumstances: insurers would not be able to respond to the claims of any of these 5 nurseries by arguing that the closure would have happened anyway, irrespective of the outbreak of measles at their particular nursery, on the basis that all the nurseries would have been shut. However, the other 6 nurseries would not be in a position to make any claim.

In such a situation, the closure of all 11 nurseries would have been distinctly caused by the measles, and the response would have been targeted at those nurseries. If, therefore, the authorities were acting in response to the so-called known unknowns – in other words a belief (proved to be correct) in the existence of cases of disease at the other 6 nurseries which has not yet been confirmed by testing or reporting – then there would be coverage. In such a case, all 11 nurseries would have been closed by reason of the occurrence of disease at the premises.</p>

If one assumes that the public health response is a consequence of all of the cases of infectious disease in the nurseries, then the simple and proper analysis is that all of the cases were concurrent causes of any business interruption loss. The position is no different if the public health response is not confined to nurseries, but extends to closure of premises in a high street, borough or town in the light of cases of infectious disease in those places –  just as the restrictions in late March 2020 were imposed in the light of all the cases of Covid-19 which had occurred in the UK, including those that had occurred (if the claimants can prove that they occurred) at the claimants’ premises. </p>

Its effect is to provide some form of localised cover, in circumstances where the nature of the diseases covered, and the range of responses to those diseases, may well not be localised, depending upon the nature of the disease and the public health response which is necessary. The argument accepts that there are circumstances in which concurrent causation will operate. For example, in both the “immediate neighbourhood” and nurseries illustrations which were advanced as part of these submissions, there were individual occurrences of disease which had combined to bring about a public health response; namely the closure of “possibly other, probably local, premises” in the former example, and the closure of nurseries in the latter. However, even in those situations, the extent of coverage would be uncertain. It is not clear whether all of the “possibly other, probably local, premises” would be entitled to cover, and the ability of all of the 11 nurseries to recover would depend upon evidence, for example, as to whether the local authority believed that the relevant disease was present at all of the nurseries, and possibly upon whether that belief was reasonable. This is the opposite of an approach which is “clear and simple to apply”, as referred to by the Supreme Court in paragraph [206] of its judgment.</p>

Thus, in the nurseries example, the public health response resulted in the actual closure of all 11 nurseries, each of which has suffered a loss in consequence of a combination of the occurrence of cases of measles. However, even in this very limited example, the 6 nurseries where measles had not actually been discovered at the time of the public health response, are not in a position to claim, at least unless the authorities believed that there were cases there. Once the example is scaled up beyond these small numbers and small-scale responses, however, a claim becomes in practical terms impossible. The insurers submitted that this was rightly so, and that this was simply the result of the policyholders having purchased restrictive “at the premises” cover. However, once it is accepted that a concurrent causation analysis is at least to some extent appropriate, so as to cover the situation where a number of separate occurrences have combined to lead to a public health response and closure of premises, I do not consider that there is anything in the language of the policy which results in the insurers’ proposed restriction of that analysis. If, as the Supreme Court held, the concurrent causation analysis can be “scaled up” in the case of coverage which applies to occurrences within 25 miles, 1 mile, or the vicinity of the premises, then I see no reason why it cannot equally be scaled up in the case of occurrences at the premises themselves. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It also seems to me that the “distinct” cause argument has much in common with the alternative “weighing” approach which was rejected by the Supreme Court. Both arguments stem from the recognition that a “but for” approach is unsatisfactory, or at least may so be regarded by a court. The insurers seek therefore to substitute a more palatable test. The “weighing approach”, rejected by the Supreme Court, involved what Mr Kramer described as a “quantitative” approach to the assessment of the impact of the relevant covered occurrences on the public health response. The “distinct cause” approach involves what can be described as a “qualitative” approach to the impact of the relevant covered occurrences on the public health response. In a case of a major problem, and a response which affects a broad range of premises, both approaches result in the impact of the covered occurrences being disregarded because of the impact of uncovered occurrences. In the case of weighing, the quantitative weighing of the uncovered cases would (on the insurers’ rejected argument) preclude recovery in respect of the covered occurrences. In the case of the “distinct” cause argument, the problem for the policyholder arises, similarly, once there is a large number of cases to which the authorities are responding, since it will not be possible to show that the covered occurrence was a distinct reason for the response.</p>

Furthermore, the relevant submissions were made in the context of the FCA’s argument relating to the nature of the insured peril: i.e. that radius clauses, on their proper construction, provided coverage against the pandemic as a whole so long as there was one case in the radius. That analysis was decisively rejected by the Supreme Court. A submission by the FCA in support of a flawed argument cannot in my view be given any weight.

In an argument that was not advanced or adopted by any of the other insurers, Mr Davie on behalf of Axa, the insurers of Mayfair, submitted that the Supreme Court’s decision on causation, in the context of radius cover, was rooted in facts which had no equivalence in the context of ATP cover. Mr Davie had carefully considered the agreed facts in the <span style="font-style:italic">FCA test case</span>, including the underlying materials. He identified certain agreed facts which showed that, prior to the government imposing its first lockdown measures, including business closures, the available underlying data was information about confirmed cases of Covid-19 in patients whose postcode was allocated to a geographic local authority area around the country. The smallest geographical areas identifiable were “Lower Tier Local Authority areas”. Since the Supreme Court was concerned with policies addressing disease in circumstances in geographic areas of 25 miles and 1 mile around insured premises, he submitted that there was “an equivalence between a case of Covid-19 in those geographic areas and the cases of Covid-19 in the local authority geographic area that the government had information about when making its closure decision”. Axa submitted that the evidence as to what caused the government to order closure of businesses does not support the conclusion that the incidence of Covid-19 at particular insured premises, or even that the collective incidences of Covid-19 at business premises generally, caused the government to order closure. </p>

On this analysis they were all effective because the authorities acted on a national level, on the basis of the information about all the occurrences of COVID-19, and it is artificial to say that only some of those which had occurred by any given date were effective causes of the action taken at that date; and still more artificial to say that because the action was taken in response to all the cases, it could not be regarded as taken in response to any particular cases. As Mr Edelman QC submitted, there is material in the Agreed Facts which provides a sufficient basis for this analysis. He pointed to the information which the government was acting upon, and a number of SAGE minutes, which show that the government response was the reaction to information about all the cases in the country, and that the response was decided to be national because the outbreak was so widespread. As Mr Edelman QC pointed out, the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care, Mr Hancock, on 28 April 2020 stated that thought had been given to imposing measures first on London and the Midlands, but it had been decided that “we are really in this together”, and that “the shape of the curve… has been very similar across the whole country”. Given this, it appears to us that it is not unrealistic to say that all the cases were equal causes of the imposition of national measures.”</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This argument is certainly imaginative, but I have no hesitation in rejecting it. It was no part of the reasoning of either the Divisional Court or the Supreme Court that the concurrent cause analysis was appropriate because of an equivalence between the radiuses referred to in the various policies and the known cases in the country, or that it was in some way based on the maps which Mr Edelman had produced in the course of his final submissions. The maps were produced in support of the proposition that the government was reacting to the cases in the country as a whole. This was relevant to the FCA’s case on concurrent causation; because it supported the proposition that all of the cases across the country were to be treated as effective causes. This was the argument that was accepted (albeit as a less satisfactory analysis) by the Divisional Court in paragraph 112 in relation to the RSA 3 wording, and was accepted more generally by the Supreme Court in its decision. That reasoning was not based upon any equivalence between radiuses from any particular premises and the government’s decision to lock down the country. The fallacy of the argument is also shown by the fact that although Mr Davie could point to a map which showed 25-mile radiuses which covered substantially the whole country, in terms of the incidence of known Covid-19 cases, he could not identify any equivalent map showing 1-mile radiuses. Nor, obviously, could he point to any map showing the cases which were “in the vicinity” of every building in the country.</p>

Declaration 8 of the Supreme Court’s declarations, which updated the Divisional Court’s declarations, concerned the manner in which policyholders may prove “actual prevalence”, with the burden of proof being on the policyholder “to prove the presence of Covid-19 within the relevant policy area”. These declarations showed that the question of whether there were occurrences within the relevant policy area was a matter to be proved in due course: it was not a matter which had been proved in the evidence before the Supreme Court thereby leading to its decision on concurrent causation.</p>

Importantly, however, the NDDA clause contained an exclusion which specifically concerned infectious or contagious diseases. The parties therefore specifically contemplated the possibility of government reactions to wide-scale emergencies which might impact upon the policyholder’s premises. However, where the reaction was to “infectious or contagious diseases”, there was an exclusion and the NDDA clause would therefore not provide cover. There was therefore no claim brought by Excel under the NDDA clause. This led to the conclusion that the coverage for infectious diseases which did exist under the relevant clause (the RSA Infectious Diseases Extension) would not write back the entirety of the NDDA cover subject only to proof of occurrence of disease at the premises. The infectious diseases coverage was only for an outbreak or occurrence that had its own distinct causal impact. It did not cover government intervention in response to a more general or widespread emergency which was concurrently caused by all cases of disease forming part of the emergency, as this is what the parties had specifically excluded in the NDDA clause. Excel’s argument therefore sought to recreate the very type of cover for infectious diseases that the parties had specifically excluded in the NDDA clause.</p>

The exclusion of coverage for infectious diseases in the NDDA clause leads only to the conclusion that such coverage must be found, if at all, elsewhere in the policy. There is an express clause (the RSA Infectious Diseases Extension) which provides such coverage, and in certain material respects it is narrower than the coverage that would have existed (absent an exclusion) if the NDDA clause had been applicable. For example, the NDDA clause excludes all contagious and infectious diseases, and the RSA Infectious Diseases Extension does not provide coverage for all such diseases but only those which are notifiable. Also, the NDDA clause would apply to access to the premises being hindered or prevented, whereas the RSA Infectious Diseases Extension provides cover only in respect of closure. There are also different limits in respect of cover: the limit under the NDDA clause is £7.5 million, whereas the limit under the RSA Infectious Diseases Extension is £15 million. All of these matters lead to the conclusion that the coverage in the RSA Infectious Diseases Extension is to be considered and interpreted on its own terms, and that it is not appropriate to attempt to read across, from the NDDA clause, exclusions or limitations which are not expressed therein. </p>

The <span style="font-style:italic">Taiping </span>insurers sought to read that across to the NDDA clause, with the consequence that there was no coverage for Covid-19. The argument was rejected.

The same is true in the present case. Indeed, there is no room for dispute that there is coverage for infectious diseases under the Infectious Diseases-Extension, and there can therefore be no room for the suggestion that the exclusion in the NDDA clause can be read over in a wholesale way so as to create an exclusion for the cover which the RSA Infectious Diseases Extension clearly provides. I see no reason why the exclusion should then be read across in a more limited fashion, so as to impact upon the appropriate test for causation.</p>

The policy therefore expressly contemplates that the national government may be responding to an outbreak, which the Supreme Court appear to have considered to be a wider concept than an occurrence: see [66]. The insurers’ argument, based on the NDDA clause, that there is no coverage under the RSA Infectious Diseases Extension, for the consequences of a wide scale emergency is in any event defeated by this language.</p>

In the course of argument, I gave the example of two restaurants, next door to each other: an Italian restaurant owned by Mario, who has an ATP policy, and a Greek restaurant owned by Costas who has radius wording (say 1 mile or “vicinity”). If Mario had contracted Covid-19 in the period before lockdown, there is no dispute that Costas would be able to rely upon Mario’s illness in order to claim for the business interruption loss flowing from the closure of his restaurant. This is because, applying the Supreme Court’s reasoning, Mario’s illness would be a concurrent cause (with many other causes) of the closure of Costas’s restaurant and therefore of his loss. However, on the insurers’ case, a completely different analysis would apply when Mario sought to claim for the closure of his own restaurant and the consequent losses. For although Mario’s illness would be treated as one of many concurrent causes of the closure of Costas’s restaurant, it would not be treated as a concurrent cause of the closure of his own restaurant. I find it difficult to see how the reasonable SME reader of Costas’s policy would (on the Supreme Court’s analysis) reach the conclusion that Mario’s illness was a concurrent cause of Costas’s loss, but that the reasonable reader of Mario’s policy would reach a completely different conclusion in relation to Mario’s loss.

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">My conclusion also resolves another issue raised by certain of the preliminary issues. The preliminary issues indicated that insurers were contending that the “at the premises” wordings required, in substance, each occurrence to have been reported to the relevant authorities and for the authorities to have acted on the basis of the knowledge so acquired. As the argument developed, however, it became clear that this was not a point which was separate from the causation argument, whether advanced on a “but for” or “distinct cause” test. The requirement for reporting and knowledge was therefore part and parcel of those causation arguments. Since I reject those arguments, and consider the Supreme Court concurrent cause test to be applicable, there is no separate point which requires resolution. In so far as a separate point was advanced, I reject it as being inconsistent with the Supreme Court decision and unsupported by any relevant wording in the clauses which I am considering.</p>

The reference to “governmental authority” was, here, clearly a reference to a national government response, and not simply a local authority response. The reference to “outbreak” was wider than occurrence. Both points led to the conclusion that there would be coverage for a wide-scale response at a national level, and therefore provided reasons why the insurers’ contrary argument should be rejected. I consider that there was force in these submissions, and that (in the case of Excel) they are further reasons for rejecting the insurers’ argument. However, those policyholders who do not have equivalent wording are in no worse position: the Supreme Court’s concurrent causation analysis applies whether or not these or equivalent words are present.</p>

All policyholders emphasised that what really mattered was whether Covid-19 was notifiable at the time when their premises were closed and therefore that their losses began. However, the policyholders with “hybrid” clauses potentially had, or at least considered that they had, a more powerful argument in this regard than those (in Hairlab) with pure “disease” clauses. This will be apparent from the summary of the argument below. The case could therefore be put somewhat differently by Mr Day on behalf of the Excel policyholders than by Mr Gruder on behalf of the Hairlab policyholders.</p>

On the true construction of the policy, the outbreak or occurrence of the disease was required to be notifiable at the time that the composite peril was complete. In the context of a hybrid clause, where an element of the composite peril was closure of the premises on the order or advice of any governmental authority, this meant that the insured peril was only complete after the order or advice to close the premises. </p>

This approach made more commercial sense in the context of a novel disease that becomes notifiable, and which might rapidly reach epidemic proportions. Whether the government had made the disease notifiable at the particular date at which the disease occurred is irrelevant to the risk being insured and entirely arbitrary. The parties cannot sensibly be taken to have agreed that cover contingent on the vagaries and precise sequence of public authority response to the disease. This turned out to be different (in terms of the date of notifiability) in Scotland, England and Wales. It was entirely foreseeable that there could be a gap between a novel disease emerging, spreading and then becoming notifiable.</p>

He referred to a provision of the Excel Policy dealing with terrorist cover (see Appendix 1), and which referred to a certificate being obtained from the government. This would necessarily occur after the terrorist incident itself, and therefore there was no logical reason why notifiability should not similarly follow the occurrence or outbreak of the illness, particularly when one was dealing with a novel disease.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the Hairlab proceedings, Mr Gruder submitted that the purpose of the “Notifiable Disease” definition in the Hairlab policy (“any human infectious or contagious disease … an outbreak of which the competent Local Authority has stipulated shall be notified to them”) was to identify those infectious or contagious diseases in respect of which there was business interruption cover if an occurrence at the premises caused loss.  The policies in Hairlab did not state that cover would only be provided in respect of a particular disease as from the date it was made notifiable under the 2010 Regulations. A reasonable small business owner reading the policy would have considered that the definition of “Notifiable Disease” was a shorthand way of listing out the diseases whose presence at the premises would attract business interruption cover if loss was suffered. He or she would not have thought that, if a policy incepted on 1 January 2020 for one year, it would make any difference whether business interruption loss was caused by the presence of Covid-19 at the premises on 4 March (prior to the disease being made notifiable) or 6 March. In the <span style="font-style:italic">FCA test case</span>, the Supreme Court had held that the government measures were taken in response to information about all the Covid-19 cases in the country as a whole.

That loss was suffered when, towards the end of March, the lockdown and restrictions were imposed. The loss, when it arose, was caused by a disease which was in fact notifiable. In the context of the Hairlab cases, he did not need to suggest that loss suffered <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">before</span> the disease became notifiable was recoverable, but it may be that claimants in other cases may wish to argue that.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mr Gruder’s primary argument, therefore, was that there was coverage provided that (i) the disease occurred prior to the closure of the premises in question and the consequent loss, and (ii) the disease was made notifiable prior to closure. As an alternative argument, however, he submitted that there would be a covered occurrence if an individual with Covid-19 had been at the relevant premises prior to 5 March, but was still suffering with Covid-19 at the time that it became a notifiable disease at 6.15 pm that evening. In that regard, he relied upon the requirement for a medical practitioner to notify the relevant local authority where the practitioner had reasonable grounds for suspecting that a patient – whom the practitioner “is attending” – had the notifiable disease. Accordingly, a doctor who had attended a severely ill patient on (for example) 3 March, would be obliged to report that case once it became notifiable 2 days later. The doctor’s obligation was not confined to reporting cases of Covid-19 which only came to his or her knowledge after 6.15 pm on 5 March. The government advice as at 16 March 2020 was that people with symptoms of Covid-19 should stay at home for 14 days. Against that background, a doctor would have reasonable grounds for suspecting that a patient, who had developed symptoms up to 14 days before 5 March 2020, still had a notifiable disease at the time that it became notifiable. As from 6.15 pm on 5 March 2020, a doctor would have to reflect on all the patients that he had treated in the previous 14 days or even earlier, and to report those cases which had exhibited symptoms typical of Covid-19 on the basis that those patients might still have Covid-19 on 5 March 2020.</p>

These words are, as Mr Hext submitted, naturally to be read as being descriptive of the outbreak or occurrence at the premises of any human or contagious disease. Accordingly, it is not any disease that must be the subject of the outbreak: it must be a disease,an outbreak of which is required by law or stipulated by the authority to be notified. Prior to 6.15 pm on 5 March 2020, any occurrences or outbreaks at Excel’s premises did not have this character and therefore did not meet that description. </p>

It is of course true that the policy covers new diseases which may, subsequent to the issue of the policies in issue here, become notifiable. That is why the policies provide coverage (subject to the various arguments that I am considering) for the consequences of Covid-19. In a loose sense, therefore, Covid-19 becomes written into the policy as a covered disease. However, on the clear language of the relevant clause, this only happens at the time that it becomes notifiable, since it is only at that time that the infectious disease acquires the character which is required under the clause. The policyholders’ argument, based on the charterparty cases, would also (if correct) logically lead to the conclusion that the closure and loss could happen prior to the disease becoming notifiable, provided that it became notifiable at some unspecified point in the future. However, Excel made it clear that they were not contending that there would be coverage where the closure had predated notifiability. Since this would be the logical conclusion of the argument, it would suggest that (as I consider to be the case) the argument is wrong.</p>

There is, in my view, nothing uncommercial or arbitrary in this approach. The policy needed to identify the nature or character of the diseases that would qualify for coverage. An approach that asks whether the disease was notifiable at the time of the relevant occurrence is straightforward to apply and perfectly sensible. This may mean that some occurrences will, depending upon when they occur, fall outside coverage. However, that is simply the ordinary consequence of the application of the words of the policy. The consequence is no more arbitrary than coverage under a 1-mile radius clause applying to occurrences within the radius, whereas occurrences just outside are uncovered. </p>

A policyholder must still show that there was an occurrence in respect of which cover was provided. A policyholder with a 1-mile radius clause must therefore establish an occurrence within the radius, and it is no assistance that there may have been other cases, causative of the government action, outside the radius. Similarly, all policyholders in the present case must establish an occurrence at the premises covered by their policies, and in all cases that must be an occurrence of a notifiable disease.</p>

The words “Notifiable Disease” are here used in close proximity to “occurrence”, and clearly apply to the occurrence and nothing else. In other words, Excel’s argument (which I have rejected), that they can relate to the “closure” referred to earlier in the Excel clause, is not available here. The definition of Notifiable Disease is “any human infectious or contagious disease … an outbreak of which the competent Local Authority has stipulated shall be notified to them”. This too is descriptive of the disease, and accordingly there is no coverage unless the disease has that character at the time of the occurrence.</p>

However, Hairlab’s policy requires an “occurrence of a Notifiable Disease … at the Premises”. Even if an individual was suffering from Covid-19 on (say) 4 March when he or she was at the relevant premises, that was simply the occurrence of a disease at the premises at that time: it was not the occurrence of a notifiable disease, since Covid-19 was not then notifiable. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The above conclusions are supported by the approach of the Court of Final Appeal (and the lower courts) in the Hong Kong case, <span style="font-style:italic">New World Harbourview Hotel Co Ltd and others v Ace Insurance Ltd and others </span>[2012] HKCFA 21. The case concerned SARS, which had become a notifiable disease on 27 March 2003. The earliest of the appellants’ losses was on 9 March 2003, which was within the period of insurance but prior to SARS becoming a notifiable disease. As can be seen from paragraph [44] of the judgment, the appellants’ argument was similar in some respects to those advanced by the policyholders in the present case. Thus it was argued that there was no temporal restriction in the relevant clause (which was a disease clause, rather than a hybrid clause), and that it did not stipulate that the insured could only recover loss sustained after the infectious disease becomes notifiable. The only requirement was that the loss was caused by a notifiable infectious or contagious disease. So long as the loss was so caused, it was the subject of the indemnity, even if it occurred before the disease became notifiable, so long as it occurred within the period of insurance.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">This argument was rejected in the leading judgment given by Sir Anthony Mason NPJ. He said at [45]:</p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.5in">“The appellants’ argument overlooks the point that the cause of the loss must be a notifiable disease and a disease does not become notifiable until it is required to be notified. That was on 27 March 2003. Before that date any loss caused by SARS was caused by a disease which was not notifiable. It is for this reason that the appellants fail on this issue”.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The policyholders sought to distinguish this case on the basis that it involved an attempt to claim for losses prior to the disease becoming notifiable, whereas none of the present policyholders sought to do that. Mr Day also emphasised that the case concerned a pure disease cover, rather than a hybrid cover. Whilst those points could fairly be made, it seems to me that the reasoning of the court was based upon the nature of the disease, namely that it must be notifiable. Notifiability was therefore descriptive of the disease that was required for the purposes of a claim. This reasoning is in my view directly applicable to the issues in the present case and is persuasive. Indeed, it is the conclusion that I have reached on the present wordings without reference to the <span style="font-style:italic">Harbourview </span>case. </p>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.5in">“… that there would be formidable difficulties in the way of any suggestion that there could be cover under a policy such as the Argenta policy, which, unlike RSA 4, has no deeming provision as to notifiability, before the date on which the disease became notifiable”. </p>

The above passage also shows that it is perfectly possible to draft a clause which applies notifiability retrospectively: see the RSA4 clause (set out in Appendix 2) referred to in this passage. However, none of the clauses with which I am concerned have a retrospective element.</p>

I did not consider that this judgment was of any assistance. The issue which I am considering was not fully argued in that case, or indeed argued at all. In Australia, Covid-19 became notifiable much earlier, on 29 January 2020, and it is not clear that any claim was actually being made on the basis of occurrences prior to that time.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">For the Kaizen policyholders, Mr Gruder submitted that the most relevant agreed fact was that the role of Medical Officer of Health no longer existed, and had not done so for 50 years. The meticulously researched legislative history would not have been knowledge available to an SME policyholder or context that would have been taken into account in understanding what the language of the policy meant. Instead, the ordinary policyholder would have understood the role of the “Public Authority” to refer to the Secretary of State or the government, and for the “Medical Officer for Health” to refer (if to anyone) to the Chief Medical Officer and/or the Deputy Chief Medical Officers for England and Wales. In his oral submissions, Mr Gruder said that the formulation in his written submissions was probably too restrictive. The relevant expression would include people other than the Chief Medical Officer and/or the Deputy Chief Medical Officers for England and the other nations in the UK. However, it would not exclude those senior people. A broadly similar argument was advanced by Mr Chapman KC on behalf of Why Not Bar.</p>

The use of the word “the” showed that the draftsman had a particular type of authority in mind. The meaning of that term should be gleaned from the wider context, and in particular (i) other policy terms, (ii) the immediate contractual context of the coverage for infectious diseases, and (iii) the specific reference to “Medical Officer of Health”.</p>

He submitted, however, that some assistance could be derived from the fact that the policy contained certain provisions (see Appendix 1) which referred to “the government or any public authority”. This showed that the government was to be distinguished from “any public authority”: the draftsman could refer to government and national government specifically when he wanted to. More generally, the use of the expression “Public Authority” was highly sensitive to the immediate context in which the words were used.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In relation to the immediate contractual context, Mr Howie relied upon the fact that other limbs of the cover for “Premises Closure or Restrictions”, leaving aside the infectious disease provision in 1 (a), were concerned with local matters; for example food and drink sold at the premises, or vermin and pests at the premises, or murder or suicide at the premises. The clause used “Public Authority” in all of those local contexts. It was inconceivable that the UK government would concern itself with these parochial matters. In support of this argument, he also repeated the submission that the infectious disease coverage was exclusively concerned with what happens at the specific premises. This is the argument which, in the context of causation, I have already rejected.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The argument as to context was, he submitted, further supported by the fact that the cover refers to “Medical Officer of Health for the Public Authority”. On its true construction, this referred to personnel whose role required them to advise a local authority, and/or to give approval on its behalf, in respect of the closure and/or placing of restrictions upon premises falling within its jurisdiction. The phrase showed that the parties intended the involvement of a particular officer, someone with a specific role. The parties could have, but did not, refer to the Chief Medical Officer by its “well-known name”. The phrase “Medical Officer of Health” was an unusual one, and was redolent of having a technical meaning. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">With those points in mind, it was highly relevant that there did exist for many years the statutory role known as “Medical Officer of Health”. This was local in nature. Although that role no longer exists, the local responsibilities formerly discharged by those Medical Officers of Health had now been assumed by other locally appointed officers. In that connection, Mr Howie referred to section 74 of the 1984 Act. The logical and reasonable conclusion was that when the parties used that expression, they had in mind the modern counterparts whose roles relevantly correspond to those of the former Medical Officers of Health. The clause therefore refers to authorised officers of local authorities who are concerned with local questions of public health and disease in the area in which the authorities operate, and whose responsibilities include giving advice or approvals with respect to the exercise of local authorities’ powers in such matters. It therefore refers to the authorised officers of local authorities who are the modern equivalents of the Medical Officers of Health.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Although the terms of the Why Not Bar Policy are not precisely the same, Mr Christie’s argument relied upon essentially the main themes in Mr Howie’s argument. For example, the Why Not Bar Policy only referred to the “Public Authority” in two parts of clause 6: the notifiable disease cover in 6A and the defects in drains cover in 6C, rather than in each of the parts of the equivalent cover in the Kaizen policies. Mr Christie submitted that the drains cover in 6C showed the local context of “Public Authority” and must refer to the local authority. The same meaning should therefore be given to the phrase in 6A. To construe clause 6 as encompassing national governments and those advising them would be (wrongly) to give no weight to the immediate contractual context. Mr Christie’s submission also emphasised that the authority that is responsible for and would be expected to act in respect of each of the matters identified in the extensions immediately surrounding 6A is a local authority or local police; for example to address injury or illness arising from foreign or injurious matter in food or drink sold from the premises, or to deal with a murder or suicide at the premises. He accepted that both central and local authorities had powers to impose restrictions on premises in response to manifestations of notifiable disease at the premises. However, it did not follow that the relevant clause was concerned at all with the powers of central government.</p>

This clause is directly linked with clause 1 a) of the “Premises Closure or Restrictions” provision which is central to the dispute, and which uses the expression “Notifiable Human Disease”. At the time that the policy was placed, it was only the national government, rather than local authorities, which stipulated for notification of outbreaks of disease. Accordingly, the expression “competent public authority” in the Definitions section must include the national government.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is true that that some provisions of the policy refer to “government or any public authority”. For example, the exclusion for “Government Action” excludes loss arising from “nationalisation confiscation requisition seizure or destruction by the government or any public authority”. (A similar exclusion is contained in the cover for riot, civil commotion and strikes). Even in the context of that expression, however, there is no reason to confine “public authority” to “local authority”. The expression is a broad one, capable of including bodies acting at a national level (such as quasi-governmental authorities or agencies to which governmental functions have been outsourced) even if not actually the “government”. Indeed, one would not expect “nationalisation” to be a matter for a local authority, and one might ordinarily expect the other matters referred to in the clause to be national rather than local.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I do not attach significance to the fact that sometimes the words “public authority” are capitalised, and sometimes they are not. This is indicative of a policy which, in this respect, has been drafted (by the insurers) unevenly, and (at least in relation to this aspect of the policy) with insufficient care or thoroughness. This is also apparent from other matters: the absence of a definition of Public Authority even though it has been capitalised, and Mr Howie’s acceptance that it is not possible to identify a consistent meaning to that expression throughout the policy. All of these matters to my mind serve to reinforce the conclusion that “Public Authority” should simply be given its ordinary, broad meaning.</p>

There is no definition of “Public Authority” in clause 6A and 6C, and indeed (unlike the Kaizen Policies) no definition of “notifiable human disease”. The policy sometimes capitalises the expression “public authority”, and sometimes does not. Thus, the exclusion to the riot cover excludes “confiscation, requisition or destruction by order of the government or any public authority”. For reasons already given, there is no reason to confine “public authority” in that context to a local authority: it can include quasi-governmental or other national agencies.</p>

The Special Conditions in the main policy wording concerning “Risk Protections” refer, in clause E 10, to notification “from a Local Authority or Magistrate” imposing any requirement for abatement of nuisance. In the light of both of these clauses, it can fairly be said that if the draftsperson had wanted to confine “Public Authority”, in clause 6A and 6C, to local authorities or Local Authorities, then they could have said so. </p>

In relation to the argument advanced in the present context, I accept some aspects of these clauses are more likely to result in local authority action than action at a national level.

The concept of a “local authority” is very well known, and the reasonable reader would conclude that the expression “Public Authority” was obviously wider and not confined to a local authority. The reasonable reader would also conclude that there was no apparent reason for the capitalisation of the undefined expression “Public Authority”, and that there was certainly nothing in the capitalisation which led to the conclusion that it was confined to a local authority. </p>

Many reasonable readers might not be able to identify precisely the name of the post, or its holder at the relevant time (Professor Sir Chris Whitty in England).

As Mr Howie explained, this potentially includes a large number of local authority officials in whom the former functions of the Medical Officer of Health now reside. These include, or at least may include, officials who have no medical qualifications, such as environmental health officers, and other people who may have no medical qualification. In my view, it would be a strange conclusion indeed that all of these officials were to be regarded as a “Medical Officer for Health” within the meaning of the policy, but that Professor Chris Whitty was not. </p>

It was used in the Public Health Act 1961, but it is not in more recent public health legislation. Section 37 of this Act relates to the sale of verminous articles and appears to be the only legislative term relating to the medical officer of health. The role itself is also historic and no longer exists. I noted that when the role was in existence, it did have a focus on local authority matters rather than anything national. But [I] considered this to be a reflection of the make-up of healthcare services generally at the time medical officers of health were introduced, rather than the current situation which is more of a mix between national and localised healthcare. </p>

As set out above, the responses to many of these diseases would be widespread and would require more nationally-orientated action. To say that the policy provides cover for a disease that would likely only be acted upon by national government, but then to limit cover to the actions of a local authority would, to my mind, provide an irrational result. </p>

An alternative question is whether a reasonable customer would consider that a clause referring to the advice of the Medical Officer of Health would include the advice of the Chief Medical Officer for England. I considered that this is how a reasonable person would have interpreted this clause at the time the policy was taken out. </p>

To paraphrase the Supreme Court, I didn’t think this would be the understanding held by the ordinary policyholder who, on entering into the contract, has read through R’s policy conscientiously in order to understand what cover they were getting.” </p>

Accordingly, there would be coverage in respect of any visitor or employee who contracted Covid-19 so that it could be diagnosed, whether or not it was verified by medical testing or formally confirmed or reported to PHE, and whether or not it was symptomatic.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Mayfair’s primary case was not really reflected in the formulation of the preliminary issue, which indicated that the issue was whether or not “suffered” required a display of symptoms of Covid-19 at the premises, or whether it also included a person to have been diagnosed with Covid-19. This may, however, have been a consequence of Mayfair’s factual case, which asserted that two employees had actually displayed such symptoms (and one of them had died). At all events, insurers did not object to Mayfair advancing this primary case, which raised an issue of construction which could be addressed at the hearing.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">If its primary case were rejected, then Mayfair submitted that the words were not materially different to the “manifesting” language considered in the <span style="font-style:italic">FCA test case</span>. On this basis visitors or employees would suffer the disease if they had symptoms of the disease whilst at the premises, or if they had been at the premises and (even if not symptomatic) had been diagnosed as having had Covid-19whilst there. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The Mayfair insurers (“Axa”) argued, in summary, that “suffered by” was not to be equated either with an occurrence of the disease, or a person “sustaining” the disease, nor with manifestation of the disease. Suffering involved the visitor or employee subjectively experiencing the disease. Accordingly, it was necessary for the visitor or employee to have been experiencing the symptoms of the disease whilst at the premises. A subsequent diagnosis, even if it indicated that the individual had the disease when at the premises, would not be sufficient.</p>

          <content>
            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Thus, in its written submissions, Axa submitted that “suffered” in context meant that a visitor or employee is required as a minimum to have had symptoms of the relevant disease at the premises, and also to have displayed those symptoms at the premises. The use of the word “suffered” would convey to a reasonable reader that it is not enough that a person merely has an infection, but rather that they are afflicted by the infectious disease by reason of suffering symptoms. This was supported by declaration 6 of the Supreme Court in the <span style="font-style:italic">FCA test case</span>: this referred to circumstances where “any such person was infected with <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">and/or</span> was suffering from Covid-19…”, which indicated that there was a distinction between the two concepts of being infected and suffering. To suffer from Covid-19 is contemplating symptomatic cases. Accordingly, Axasubmitted that the clause limited the relevant disease circumstances at the premises to stipulated types of people connected with the premises (visitors or employees) who experience adverse effects from being infected with the disease, rendering them symptomatic whilst at the premises. The symptoms are physical or mental features which indicate a condition of disease, particularly a feature that is apparent to the patient. Accordingly, when disease was suffered by any visitor or employee at the premises as a result of having symptoms, those symptoms were required to be apparent or displayed at the premises. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In summary, the visitor or employee must have (1) displayed symptoms of Covid-19 at the premises and/or (2) be diagnosed as having had Covid-19 whilst at the premises. However, a diagnosis of Covid-19 alone is not sufficient to establish a case which has been “suffered” at the premises because it does not necessarily mean that a symptomatic case of Covid-19 came to light at the premises. It must therefore be established that the relevant person was displaying symptoms of Covid-19 while at the premises, with the identity of the disease capable of being proved by a positive diagnosis of Covid-19 before, during or after attendance at the premises.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Axa accepted that, in the present case, if it were to be proved that Covid-19 was manifested at the premises by two employees on 8 March 2020, and they were then hospitalised shortly thereafter due to Covid-19, that would demonstrate the display of potential Covid-19 symptoms at the premises and a court would not require much persuasion that hospitalisation and diagnosis of Covid-19 shortly thereafter allows the inference to be drawn that the symptoms displayed at the premises were actually symptoms of Covid-19. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In his oral submissions, Mr Davie said the word “suffering” imported the idea of enduring something unwelcome and that it connoted a subjective experience. (Mr Fawcett had used the word “subjective” in his submissions, albeit in a different sense to the point being made by Mr Davie). The word, in context, was focusing on the actual impact on the relevant person: an actual experience, enduring an unwelcome development.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Axa also submitted that their interpretation of “suffered by”, when viewed in conjunction with the need for the disease to be suffered by “a visitor or employee”, reinforced and demonstrated the correctness of their submission as to the appropriate causation test discussed in section D above. In his oral submissions, Mr Davie emphasised that the words told the reader that the clause was concerned with people who had a “particular relationship with the premises”. Furthermore, these words were deliberately identifying a relationship with the premises that could be seen to be relevant to the health and safety obligations which are imposed on a business owner who has obligations in relation to employees but also obligations to anybody who might be affected by the working practices which, therefore, covers visitors. They were therefore concerned with a specific category of person at a specific place. In support of this submission on causation, the insurers also referred to the fact that, at the end of the schedule to the policy, there was wording in which policyholders were specifically reminded of their obligations in respect of health and safety.</p>

This is what is meant by “manifested” as used within clause 7.3.9(a). Clearly someone who is displaying symptoms of a disease can be said to “manifest” it. We consider that it would also be the case that a person “manifested” the disease if, though superficially asymptomatic, he or she was diagnosed with the disease, because the disease would have “manifested” itself to the diagnoser. We do not consider that it is possible to speak of someone who is asymptomatic and has not been diagnosed as having the disease as having “manifested” it.”</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">In the light of these definitions, the word “suffer” in the context of illness or disease can be used synonymously with “sustained”. This is clear from paragraph [93] of the Divisional Court’s judgment, relied upon by Mr Fawcett on behalf of Mayfair, and which was later reflected in the Supreme Court declarations quoted above:</p>
            <block name="embeddedStructure">
              <embeddedStructure>
                <level>

                    <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.5in">“[93]. In relation to the first argument it is helpful to deal at the outset with two preliminary points. The first is that it is common ground that COVID-19 was a Notifiable Disease for the purposes of Extension vii (a)(iii) in all parts of the United Kingdom by 6 March 2020. The second is as to what constituted an “occurrence” of COVID-19, and in particular what constituted such an “occurrence” within the 25 mile radius provided for in Extension vii. The FCA’s case is that there will have been an occurrence of the disease whenever or wherever a person had contracted COVID-19 such that it was diagnosable, whether or not it had been verified by diagnosis, and whether it was symptomatic. RSA’s pleaded case is that nothing less than an actual diagnosis of COVID-19 would be sufficient to establish any relevant “occurrence”. We consider that there will have been an “occurrence” of COVID-19 within an area when at least one person who was infected with COVID-19 was in the relevant area.  We do not consider that it is necessary for there to have been an “occurrence” of the disease that the case should have been diagnosed. The definition of Notifiable Disease is in relevant part “illness sustained by any person resulting from … any human infectious or human contagious disease…”  <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Such a Disease thus “occurs” when the illness is “sustained” by a person, which we consider means, in simple terms, that they are suffering from it, not that they have been diagnosed with it. </span> This fits in with the other parts of the Extension.  For example, in sub-clause a(i) of Extension vii, if there were cases of food poisoning at the premises, which led to business interruption, but it took some time for it to be diagnosed that this was due to a Notifiable Disease, we would consider that the Notifiable Disease had “occurred” when there were the first cases of food poisoning, and that the “occurrence” was not postponed until there was diagnosis. (Emphasis supplied).”</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">It is true that the Divisional Court was not here considering the present argument, but rather was addressing whether or not an actual diagnosis was required in order for there to be an occurrence or for the disease to be “sustained”. Nevertheless, the paragraph shows that “suffer” is not confined to the case where a person is subjectively experiencing a level of personal discomfort. In a case where a disease has been diagnosed, there is in my view no difficulty in saying that the person has been “suffering” from the disease from the time that the person contracted the disease, even though it may have taken some time for the individual to experience the level of discomfort which led to the consultation of a doctor or the taking of a test for the disease. In view of the use of the word “sustained” synonymously with “was suffering” in the body of the judgment of the Divisional Court, I do not attach any significance to the fact that declaration 6 (which is based on the Divisional Court’s judgment) refers to “such person was infected with and/or was suffering from COVID- 19”.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The question remains, however, as to how the words “suffered by any visitor or employee” in the present insurance policy are to be interpreted. Whilst the argument of the insurers is certainly grammatically possible on the basis of the word “suffer”, I think that it makes far more commercial sense to interpret it as being synonymous with “sustain”. This gives a clear and simple test to apply, and (as shown by the decision of the Supreme Court in the <span style="font-style:italic">FCA test case</span>) this is a relevant factor when it comes to interpreting the policy. </p>

          <content>
            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">By contrast, if the word “suffer” were to denote the subjective experience of the visitor or employee, there would be an uncertain threshold for the identification of the point at which the subjective experience was sufficiently bad to mean that the person was “suffering”. The insurers contended that this was not difficult to ascertain: it would depend upon whether the individual was symptomatic. However, it is not clear why a person experiencing minor symptoms, but was not in any significant discomfort at all, would be regarded as “suffering” from the disease, if a subjective experience approach were required. </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Furthermore, in a case (favoured by the insurers in the context of their causation arguments) where a serious and highly infectious disease had been diagnosed in an individual on the day after he or she had been at the premises, and where the authorities had decided that closure was required because of that very illness, there is no reason why a claim for BI losses should depend upon whether the individual happened to be feeling perfectly well (and was therefore asymptomatic) on the day of the visit to the premises, or happened to be feeling unwell to a degree. </p>

          <content>
            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, I accept Mayfair’s primary case as to the meaning of “suffer” as being equated with “occur” or “sustain”. If I had not accepted that case, I would have accepted Mayfair’s alternative case that “suffer” would include all of those in whom the disease was manifested in accordance with the approach in declaration 7. If a visitor or employee was at the premises and either displayed symptoms of Covid-19 there, or was diagnosed with Covid-19 (and therefore had the illness when he or she was there), then in both cases the disease was suffered by the individual whilst at the premises. I can see no good reason why the use of the word “suffer” should be interpreted more narrowly than “manifest” in the present context. The example given in the previous paragraph illustrates why it should not be. However, I agree with Mayfair that there is nothing in the clause which requires the disease to be apparent (either to the individual or to a diagnoser), and this is one reason why I prefer Mayfair’s primary case to its alternative. However, if the disease is actually apparent, either because the individual knows that he is suffering unwelcome symptoms, or because it is actually diagnosed, then in both cases the requirement of “suffered by” is met. I therefore do not accept the insurers’ argument that “suffered by” means something more apparent, or more visible, than “manifested”.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">I now turn to the Mayfair insurers’ broader arguments on causation, but I can deal with these briefly. In short, I do not consider that any of the differences between the Mayfair policy language and the language of other policies produces a causation analysis different to that discussed in Section D above. I have already considered the word “suffer” and concluded this is to be equated with “occur/ sustain”, alternatively “manifested”, both of which were subject to the Supreme Court’s causation analysis.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There is also, in my view, no significance – in terms of the causation analysis – to the provision requiring the person who “suffers” to be a visitor or employee. In practical terms, this is likely to cover practically all of the people who will have been in the night-club premises. The only possibly excluded people, on the insurers’ submission, are directors or employers or owners. However, the owner in the present case is a corporate entity, and it is by no means clear that any shareholders in the owning company, who went to the premises, would be excluded from the concept of a “visitor”. It is also open to argument whether a director, who went to the premises, was also a “visitor”, and it is also possible that a director may have an employment contract as well and therefore come within the expression “employee”. In any event, at best (from insurers’ perspective) only a very small subset of people who sustained the illness, or in whom the illness was manifested, would fail to qualify as a visitor or employee. The existence of this small subset can in my view make no difference to the causation analysis. In that context, it is to be noted that those in whom the disease was manifested is likely to be a much larger subset of the people in whom the disease occurred, but nevertheless the existence of this large subset made no difference to the Supreme Court’s causation analysis.</p>

The fact that one aspect of Mayfair’s legal obligations is referred to at the end of the Mayfair Policy schedule, but not the other policies, is of no significance.</p>
