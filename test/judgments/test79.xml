He did not visit that country again until the early 1990s. According to ZS, at around this time NJ had a two year relationship with ZS’s mother, leading to the birth of ZS. However, when NJ found out about the pregnancy, he broke off the relationship with ZS’s mother, not wanting a family.</p>

There was then a further delay and instructions to progress this application were given only in October 2023. By this time EM had died, and JK took the view that, in such circumstances, he could no longer act under the letters of administration on behalf of NJ’s estate. On 19 December 2023 ZS issued the present application seeking a final declaration.</p>

Such conclusion appeared amply to satisfy the burden on ZS of showing that NJ was her father. However, as I explained at the hearing, on a more careful reading I am not satisfied that this report is sufficient to evidence ZS’s case.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The report describes the testing process as follows: “<span style="font-style:italic">An independent sample collector obtained consent to collect and test buccal cell samples from the above named individuals for the purpose of DNA analysis. Samples, photographs and ID documents were then collected and returned to AlphaBiolabs.</span>” That description – of taking buccal cells, presumably via a cheek swab – cannot, on the facts presented to me, be an accurate description of the testing of NJ’s DNA. NJ had died more than two years before the testing date, and the evidence I had was that DNA testing was to be, and was, carried out on a blood sample, not on buccal cells. It may be that this language is just a <span style="font-style:italic">pro forma</span> description – and that, in fact, AlphaBiolabs did indeed test NJ’s DNA using a blood sample, and did indeed take proper steps to verify both the identity of the individual whose blood was being tested, and the individual whose cheek cells were being tested – but the description given by the AlphaBiolabs reports leaves me uncertain as to whose DNA was actually tested, and by what means.</p>

However, in the bundle of material provided to me, other evidence was oddly lacking. I was told of a two-year relationship between ZS’s mother and NJ, but no evidence was adduced from ZS’s mother, nor any explanation for its absence. I was told of the contents of ZS’s birth certificate, but that document was not in the bundle. The evidence stated that “<span style="font-style:italic">All official documents relating to the respondent show his name as [NJ]</span>”, but no examples of this were exhibited. I was also told that NJ’s “<span style="font-style:italic">British passport named his place of birth</span>” as his home country but, again, this was not exhibited.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">I also raised concerns with Ms Jankowska, the trainee solicitor appearing on behalf of ZS, that in answer to the question on the application form “<span style="font-style:italic">What effect would the granting of a declaration of parentage have upon the status of [ZS] as regards [her] nationality, citizenship or right to be in the United Kingdom</span>”, the answer given was simply “<span style="font-style:italic">None</span>”. I queried whether this was correct – since, for example, it might depend on whether NJ had acquired British citizenship before ZS’s birth. Ms Jankowska frankly accepted that she did not know whether this question had in fact been investigated. This gives me cause for concern as to the efforts that had been made to verify the other assertions contained in the application documents.</p>

As described in paragraph 7 above, that is indeed what occurred. However, JK was correct to think that, following the death of EM, he could no longer represent the estate: the grant of letters of administration to JK was qualified by the words “<span style="font-style:italic">The lawful attorney of [EM] for their use and benefit limited until further representation be granted</span>”, and an attorney in such circumstances is debarred from acting further under his grant once he knows of the death of the donor – see <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Tristram and Coote’s Probate Practice</span> (32<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> ed, 2021) at ¶11.102; <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Williams, Mortimore &amp; Sunnucks – Executors, Administrators and Probate</span> (22<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> ed, 2023) at ¶15-15.</p>

By way of analogy, although not directly applicable to the present application, I note that such possibility is specifically provided for in civil claims by CPR 19.12(1)(a). Alternatively, I could simply waive the requirement that NJ’s estate remain as a respondent at all: compare <span style="font-style:italic">Aylward-Davies v Chesterman </span>at [18]-[19]. I am concerned, however, that there may yet be aspects to the substantive application under section 55A of the 1986 Act where submissions on behalf of NJ’s estate, or access to documents held by NJ’s estate, will be of benefit to the court, and so I am reluctant to allow a situation where NJ’s estate is either not a respondent, or a respondent in name only.</p>

NJ appears to have left no spouse or civil partner; no child (save perhaps, which is the very question in this application, ZS); no parent; no siblings (except for his sister, who has now died); no nephews or nieces. I have no information as to whether NJ had, or has, any first cousins. JK did not know who (if anyone) was acting for the estate of EM (NJ’s sister), which might be a matter of Swiss law, since that is where she was understood to be resident at the time of her death.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The original letters of administration recorded that the gross value of the estate of NJ in England and Wales amounted to £3,500, and the net value amounted to £0. JK’s understanding was that NJ had no significant worldwide assets: he had had intellectual property rights which had been sold to satisfy liabilities of the estate, but that was all. In these circumstances, and given the limited purpose for which the estate is to be represented in these proceedings, I consider it disproportionate to require any advertisements, or any further investigations to be conducted, to establish who, if anyone, may be entitled to a grant. Rather, in circumstances where EM previously appointed JK as her attorney for the purpose of administering NJ’s estate, I consider that the special circumstances of this case make it expedient to re-appoint JK as administrator, for the limited purpose of representing NJ’s estate in these proceedings. JK has consented to such appointment. Since there has been a prior grant of administration, this will be of the <span style="font-style:italic">de bonis non</span> type (see, e.g., <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Williams, Mortimore &amp; Sunnuks</span> at ¶16-06; and <span style="font-style:italic">Perotti v Watson</span> [2004] EWCA Civ 269 at [5]).
