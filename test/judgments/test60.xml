                <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In our judgment, the meaning of paragraph (5) is clear and unqualified. If the conditions stated in subparagraphs (a) and (b) are satisfied, then the defendant is treated as having accepted that ‘the court has jurisdiction to try the claim’. The conditions include that the defendant does not make an application for an order pursuant to CPR 11(1) within 14 days after filing an acknowledgment of service. An application to set aside an order extending the time for service made before the filing of an acknowledgement of service is not an application under CPR 11(1) nor is it an application made within 14 days after the filing of the acknowledgment of service. The district judge (rightly) did not hold that the application to set aside the order extending time for service was an application under CPR 11(1). Rather, he said that the earlier application to set aside the order rendered it unnecessary to make an application under CPR 11(1). But in our judgment, there is no warrant for holding that, if an application is made before the filing of an acknowledgment of service to set aside an order extending the time for service, this has the effect of disapplying the requirement for an application under CPR 11(1). There is no such express disapplication, nor does one arise by necessary implication.</p>

                <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">I should add, since it is relevant to some of the argument advanced in this case, that it is clear that the failure to tick the box in a Claim form indicating an intention to contest the court’s jurisdiction is neither a necessary nor a sufficient basis to do so. It is not necessary because an application under CPR 11(1) is not predicated on the defendant having done so; it is not sufficient because, once the Acknowledgment of Service is served, CPR 11(1) sets out a different procedure that must be adopted in order to contest the court’s jurisdiction. However, the court will not doubt be alert in the appropriate case to the possibility that, by failing to tick the relevant box, the defendant may in fact be taken to have accepted that the court has jurisdiction to hear the case. That matter will be fact specific. It would certainly not apply here where the Acknowledgment of Service was accompanied by a letter specifically raising that issue.</p>

                <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">It will be noted that the consequence of this is that failing to comply with CPR 11(1) is a discrete way of submission to the jurisdiction that arises by virtue of CPR 11(5). A party may make application under CPR 11(1) but be treated as submitting to the jurisdiction by reason of other factors (though given the need for such submission to be unequivocal, this may be rare). But equally a party who has unequivocally <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">not</span> submitted to the jurisdiction may be treated as having done so by virtue of the failure to comply with CPR 11(1). The court needs to be astute not to confuse the two, though matters that are relevant to the determination of whether the defendant has submitted to the jurisdiction on one of the grounds may equally be relevant to submission on the other.</p>

The first point to make is that, by reference to anything other than the terms of CPR Part 11, the Judge was undoubtedly entitled to find that there was no submission to the jurisdiction. The Respondent repeatedly made clear its intention to argue that it disputed the Appellants’ right to rely on the Claim form on the grounds that its validity had expired; indeed, it applied to strike the claim out on this basis. Disregarding for the moment the effect of Part 11, the District Judge was clearly entitled to come to the conclusion that “there had been no waiver, express or implied, of its right to challenge the jurisdiction<span style="font-style:italic">.”</span></p>

              <p class="BodyCL" style="margin-left:0.5in">Judge Pearce then turned to the argument, raised in the Respondent’s Notice, that the decision of DJ Matharu ought to be upheld on the basis that the Respondent’s application to strike out the claim should have been treated as an application under CPR 11. He was referred to the decision of Dingemans J in <span style="font-style:italic">Caine v Advertiser and Times Ltd </span>[2019] EWHC 39 (QB), but distinguished it on the facts. In <span style="font-style:italic">Caine</span> two different applications had been made, the second of which had expressly referred to CPR Part 11 even though the first had not. In the present case, by contrast, the Defendant’s application had not referred to CPR Part 11 at all. Judge Pearce went on to consider the Respondent’s alternative argument, that the failure of the application expressly to refer to CPR 11 was an error of procedure capable of being rectified under CPR 3.10.

                <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in">In her judgment, the District Judge spoke of the Appellants’ “dilatory or lax approach to good and proper service.” In the light of the procedural failings found in her judgment (which though initially the subject of an application for permission to appeal, were not pursued to an oral hearing of the application), it is impossible to find some kind of equivalence with the criticism that is to be made of the Respondent. The Respondent would not have fallen foul of CPR Part 11 if it had added one line to an Application Notice so as to set out expressly an argument that it was clearly seeking to make in any event, albeit by a different procedural route. In contrast, the District Judge found much to be critical of in the Claimant’s approach to service of originating process. Every litigation lawyer knows (or at least should know) the importance of timely service of originating process. It has been repeatedly spelt out by the court, for example by Lord Sumption in <span style="font-style:italic">Barton v Wright Hassall</span>. In those circumstances, the mere fact that a defendant may know in detail the case that the claimant wishes to advance is not a ground to refuse to exercise the power under CPR 3.10 to regularise the defendant’s attempt to strike the claim out, achieving the result that the claimant is permitted to pursue its claim notwithstanding late service of the Claim form. Equally, there is no basis for concluding that to find for the Respondent on the issue in question would be to hold it to a different standard than the Appellants (and other litigants) are held to.</p>

The right to such a declaration was clearly inherent to the application that the Respondent was making; the application was made in time; it was supported by a witness statement making clear that the basis of the application was the failure to serve the Claim form within the term of its validity; and compliance with CPR 11(1) would have been achieved by the addition of minimal additional wording which was implicit in the application that was being made in any event. The court should exercise its power to rectify the procedural failing so as to render this an application under CPR 11(1). Any other result would be a triumph of form over substance.</p>

              <p class="BodyCL" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Trotman, for the Appellants, submits that Judge Pearce’s decision to dismiss his client’s appeal was based on an impermissible use of the rectification power under CPR 3.10, which must not be used to achieve something expressly prohibited by other Rules. He cited <span style="font-style:italic">Vinos</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">v Marks &amp; Spencer plc </span>[2001] 3 All ER 784. The claimant had failed to serve the claim form in time. After the four month period had expired he sought a retrospective extension of time and an order remedying the error which his solicitors had made. This court held that CPR 3.10 was not available for this purpose. May LJ said at paragraph 20:</p>
            </intro>
            <subparagraph>
              <content>
                <p class="Quote">“The meaning of rule 7.6(3) is plain. The court has power to extend the time for serving the claim form after the period for its service has run out "only if" the stipulated conditions are fulfilled. That means that the court does not have power to do so otherwise. The discretionary power in the rules to extend time periods – rule 3.1(2)(a) - does not apply because of the introductory words. The general words of Rule 3.10 cannot extend to enable the court to do what rule 7.6(3) specifically forbids, nor to extend time when the specific provision of the rules which enables extensions of time specifically does not extend to making this extension of time.”</p>

            <subparagraph>
              <content>
                <p class="Quote">“A principle of construction is that general words do not derogate from specific words. Where there is an unqualified specific provision, a general provision is not to be taken to override that specific provision. Rule 7.6 is a specific sub-code dealing with the extension of time in all cases where the time limits in rule 7.5 have not been or are likely not to be met. The sub-code sets out in some detail what the claimant must do if he wants an extension of time and the circumstances in which the court may exercise the discretion conferred on it to extend the time: rule 7.6(3). That the circumstances specified in sub-paragraphs (a), (b) and (c) of rule 7.6(3) are the sole relevant conditions for the discretion to be exercisable seems to me to be made crystal clear by the words "only if". It is plain that the general power in paragraph 3.1(2)(a) to extend time cannot override rule 7.6. Nor, in my judgment, could the general power in rule 3.10 to remedy a failure to comply with a rule be pressed into service to perform the like function of, in effect, extending time. Even though rule 3.10 differs from rule 3.1(2) in not having wording to the effect of "except where the rules provide otherwise", that is too slight an indication to make rule 3.10 override the unambiguous and restrictive conditions of rule 7.6(3).”</p>

An example of such an express prohibition is in CPR 7.6(3). If a claimant applies retrospectively for an order to extend the time for service of a claim form the court may make such an order only if the remaining conditions laid down by the rule have been fulfilled. If they have not been fulfilled then Rule 3.10 is simply not available. But the Vinos principle must not be expanded into saying that CPR 3.10 cannot be used to rectify any breach of the CPR. Otherwise the Rule would be deprived of its utility. When CPR 3.10 is invoked it presupposes that some error of procedure has been made. Without it civil litigation would be even more beset by technicalities than it is already. </span></p>
