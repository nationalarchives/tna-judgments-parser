            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This appeal and cross-appeal arise out of two Grain and Feed Trade Association (“GAFTA”) appeal awards relating to Cost &amp; Freight free out (“C&amp;FFO”) Mundra sales made of pulses by the appellant seller, Viterra BV (“the Sellers”), to the respondent buyer, Sharp Corporation Ltd (“the Buyers”).</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The appeal concerns the jurisdiction of the court on appeals from arbitration awards under the Arbitration Act 1996 (“the Act”). In particular, it is contended that the Court of Appeal erred in (i) amending the question of law for which permission to appeal had been given; (ii) deciding a question of law which the GAFTA Appeal Board (“the Appeal Board”) was not asked to determine and on which it did not make a decision, and (iii) in making findings of fact on matters on which the Appeal Board had made no finding.</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The cross-appeal concerns the Appeal Board’s award of damages to the Sellers. Pursuant to the GAFTA Contract No 24 Default Clause, damages were awarded on the basis of the estimated C&amp;FFO Mundra value of the goods. At the date of default the goods had been landed, warehoused and customs cleared in Mundra. In such circumstances the Buyers contend that damages should have been awarded on an “as is, where is” basis, being the estimated ex warehouse Mundra value of the goods.</p>

The Appeal Board accepted the Sellers’ submission that the Buyers were responsible for these expenses under the terms of the contracts, but they held that the Buyers were entitled to recover these expenses from the Sellers because “the goods were returned to Sellers and resold by them”.</p>

It follows that, in determining ‘the actual or estimated value of the goods, on the date of default’, the Board should have paid regard … to the market price at the place where the goods were on the date of default. The Board’s decision, which is based upon the cost of a new shipment on the default date from the original load port, does not do so. If the actual goods, which were released on 2 February 2018, had risen in value by that time (as the Board held at para 7.41), because of the effect of the imposition of import duties, then the damages calculation should have reflected that increased value.”</span></p>

Popplewell LJ concluded that the damages payable under the default clause were to be assessed on the basis of a notional substitute contract for the goods on the same terms as the parties’ contract, save as to price, at the date of default. This, however, was not a C&amp;FFO Mundra contract because by the date of default the contracts had been varied so as to become contracts for the sale of the goods ex warehouse, subject to the same qualification in relation to risk, and on the instalment payment terms set out in the addenda. In support of this finding of variation the Court of Appeal found that delivery of the goods had been given against presentation to the Vessel’s agent of the original bills of lading which had thereby ceased to be documents of title and had become “accomplished”. They considered that this conclusion was supported by the terms of the Buyers’ LOI which contained a missing word, namely “discharge” so that it should read: “after cargo [discharge] has been made with Original Bs/L having been submitted to vessel agent.”</p>

This was held to fall within the question of law as the Court amended it by adding “in the circumstances as found by the Appeal Board in the Awards,” after the opening words “Where goods sold C&amp;F free out are located at their discharge port on the date of the buyer’s default, …”.</p>

It has always been and remains the Buyers’ case that this is the correct approach under the Default Clause. Although this produces a similar result to the decision of the Court of Appeal, it is not dependent on the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the contracts were varied, a conclusion which, if the appeal succeeds, was not open to the Court.</p>

As is made clear by the Report on the Arbitration Bill of the Departmental Advisory Committee (“the DAC Report”) which led to the enactment of the Act, the abolition of the right of appeal was considered but it was instead decided to retain a limited right subject to the “safeguards” set out in section 69. It is important and indeed necessary that these safeguards are respected and applied, consistently with the general principle set out in section 1(c) of the Act that “the court should not intervene except as provided” in Part 1 of the Act (which includes section 69).</p>

The responses showed that in some cases applications for leave to appeal have been made and granted on the basis that an examination of the reasons for the award shows an error on a point of law that was not raised or debated in the arbitration. This method of proceeding has echoes of the old and long discarded common law rules relating to error of law on the face of the award, and is in our view a retrograde step.

I allowed an amendment which related the question to the actual contract rather than to “a” clause in “a” contract. As I stated at para 19, “<span style="color:#242021">permission was obviously being given in relation to how that question is to be answered in relation to the contract under appeal”.</span></p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present case the question has similarly been framed in abstract terms: “Where goods sold C&amp;F free out are located at their discharge port on the date of the buyer’s default…”. The effect of the amendment made by the Court of Appeal is to tie that generally expressed question to the facts found in the Awards. The additional words “in the circumstances as found by the Appeal Board in the Awards” are referring to the Appeal Board’s factual findings as made clear by the reference to what was “found”. In my judgment that is permissible. Any question of law for which permission to appeal is sought under section 69 falls to be considered “on the basis of the findings of fact in the award” (section 69(3)(c)). The amendment was expressly stating what is implicit in any arbitration appeal. It did not change the substance of the question of law.</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Mr Michael Collett KC for the Sellers argued that the only facts stated in the question of law are that the goods were (i) sold C&amp;F free out and (ii) located at their discharge port on the date of the buyer’s default and that the permission to appeal given was limited to those facts. I reject that submission. These are the key facts identified in the question of law but that question is necessarily being asked by reference to the findings of fact in the Awards. Indeed, Jacobs J referred to further facts in his reasons for giving permission, such as the rise in value as a result of the imposition of import tariffs.</p>

It was this which was critical to the Court of Appeal’s conclusion that the contract was varied and so it did not matter if the finding of discharge being made against presentation of the bills of lading was a matter of fact. I reject that submission. It is clear that the Court of Appeal’s finding of discharge against bills of lading was central to its conclusion that there was a variation. It is addressed at length in the judgment. It is set out in terms in para 70 of the judgment and in the very next sentence the Court of Appeal held that “therefore” the contract had ceased to be a C&amp;F contract. In any event, I doubt that it is correct to characterise the task of determining what word was missing from the one-off terms of the Buyers’ LOI in the particular factual background circumstances of this case (as to which there are no specific findings because the issue was not raised before the Appeal Board) as a matter of construction, nor was it approached by the Court of Appeal in that way.

It is not, however, necessary to reach a conclusion on this issue since on any view the finding that discharge was made against the original bills of lading is a finding of fact which it was not open to the Court of Appeal to make and this was critical to the Court’s conclusion that the contracts had been varied.</p>

This is the sense in which ‘fulfilment’ is used throughout GAFTA 49… The use of the same term in the opening words of clause 20 indicates that that clause is concerned with non-performance. For this purpose, it does not matter whether the contract has not been performed because it was repudiated in advance of the time for performance, or because it was simply not performed when that time arrived. In either case, there is nothing other than contractual performance which can be said not to have been ‘fulfilled’.</span></p>

In other words, if the injured party has gone into the market and bought or sold against the defaulter, the arbitrators may accept that the default price should be used to calculate damages, notwithstanding the objections of one or other party or even both of them. The second basis of assessment is the difference between the contract price and the ‘actual or estimated value’ of the contract goods at the ‘date of default’. This means the date of the ‘default of fulfilment’ referred to in the opening words of clause 20, ie the date on which the contract should have been ‘fulfilled’ by performance in accordance with its terms.

This means that (i) there is no recovery for loss which should reasonably have been avoided; (ii) there is recovery for loss incurred in taking reasonable mitigating steps, even if that increases the loss and (iii) if the loss is successfully reduced by the taking of reasonable mitigating steps then the party in breach is entitled to the benefit of that - there is no recovery for avoided loss – see, for example, the judgment of Robert Goff J in <span style="font-style:italic">Koch Marine Inc v d’Amica Societa di Navigazione arl (The Elena d’Amico) </span>[1980] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 75 at p 88.

So, for example, in the sale of goods the mitigatory step of obtaining a reasonable substitute sale (where the injured party is the seller) or purchase (where the injured party is the buyer) will generally be the basis of the compensatory damages recoverable.</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It is clear that both the compensatory principle and the principle of mitigation are reflected in the default clause. The starting point for damages is sub-clause (a) which addresses the situation where the injured party goes into the market and makes a substitute sale or purchase, as the case may be. As is well established, and as recognised in sections 50(3) and 51(3) of the Sale of Goods Act 1979, this is what the injured party would be expected to do in reasonable mitigation of its loss where there is an available market for the goods. If neither party is dissatisfied with the default price under the substitute transaction (see sub-clause (b)) then that will fix the default price and, under sub-clause (c), the damages payable will be the difference between the contract price and the default price. The damages will thereby be established by reasonable steps taken by the injured party in mitigation of its loss. As Lord Sumption stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Bunge v Nidera </span>at para 32: “sub-clauses <span style="color:#242021">(a) and (b) cover the territory occupied by the common law principles concerning the mitigation of losses arising from price movements.” </span></p>

The arbitration tribunal may decide that it is appropriate to take the default price of the substitute contract as the basis for the assessment of damages. Alternatively, it may decide that that is not appropriate, in which case the default price will be based on “the actual or estimated value of the goods, on the date of default”. On what basis is the arbitration tribunal to decide whether or not it is appropriate to take the substitute contract default price as the basis for assessment of damages? The answer is by application of the principle of mitigation and the compensatory principle – ie whether that default price derived from a substitute contract reasonably made so as to result in a reasonable measure of the injured party’s loss in accordance with the compensatory principle.</p>

This is because they were sales to a related company and so were not arms-length transactions. If, however, the Sellers had sought to rely on those sales, and the Buyers had expressed dissatisfaction with the resulting default prices, then the fact that they were not arms-length transactions would be a good example of why an arbitration tribunal might refuse to accept those prices as establishing the default price under sub-clause (c). They would not reflect the market price and therefore would not be an appropriate means of establishing the default price in accordance with the principle of mitigation and the compensatory principle.</p>

In the present case, on the default date the Sellers were left with goods which had been landed, customs cleared and stored and were situated in a warehouse in Mundra. Moreover, the goods so situated had significantly increased in value because of the imposition of customs tariffs. In such circumstances the obvious market in which to sell the goods, and in which it would clearly be reasonable to do so, is the ex warehouse Mundra market. Indeed, this was the market into which the Sellers did sell the goods, albeit to a related company. Conversely, it is difficult to see how it could be reasonable to sell those goods in the international market involving, as it would, the costs of re-exporting the goods and losing the increase in value resulting from the goods being customs cleared before the significant increase in tariffs.</p>

Accordingly, the time at which the market price is relevant for the purpose of assessing damages is the time (if any) fixed for acceptance of the documents or if no such time is fixed the time of the buyer’s refusal to accept and pay against documents. If at that time there is a market for goods afloat at the place where the documents should have been accepted, that would prima facie be the market by reference to which damages are to be assessed. But this is by no means an invariable rule and it is submitted that any other market in which it would be reasonable for the seller to dispose of the goods would be relevant if there was no market where the documents should have been accepted. If there is no market for goods afloat, the market at the destination will be the relevant one, since that will be that market in which the seller will normally dispose of the goods; and if at the time of the buyer’s breach the goods are still afloat the time at which that market is relevant will be the time of the arrival of the goods or such reasonable time thereafter as is needed by the seller for disposing of the goods.”</span></p>

As stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Barrow v Arnaud</span>, the market measure of damages recognises that in a case of non-acceptance “the seller may take his goods into the market and obtain the current price for them”.

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">By contrast, the approach of the Appeal Board involves ignoring the fact that the Sellers were left with the contract goods. Their approach to damages does not involve a substitute sale of goods, still less the contract goods. It involves the notional purchase of a further consignment of goods in a different market in a different continent (FOB Vancouver) resulting in the arrival of the goods at Mundra weeks after the date of default. Such an approach reflects neither the principle of mitigation nor the commercial realities of a seller left with contract goods following a buyer’s default. Further, the Sellers were unable to provide any authority to support this approach to damages in a case involving goods being left in the seller’s hands. </p>

There can be little doubt that had the substitute sales made by the Sellers been made on an arms-length basis then such sales would likely have been taken to establish the default price under sub-clause (a), or, if disputed, sub-clause (c). These sales were of the goods as they lay, customs cleared and warehoused in Mundra, to a domestic buyer. Although nominally sold on C&amp;FFO terms, it was the Sellers’ own case that they were not priced on that basis since the sale price took into account the fact that they had been customs cleared and also storage costs. They were in effect ex warehouse Mundra sales. It would clearly have been reasonable for the Sellers to enter into an arms-length mitigation sale on that basis. If they had done so then the default price would be likely to have been established thereby. If an actual ex warehouse Mundra sale would have been reasonable mitigation under sub-clause (a) so as to establish the default price, it would be surprising if a deemed mitigation sale under sub-clause (c) on the same terms could not do so. One would expect deemed mitigation under sub-clause (c) to reflect what would have been reasonable actual mitigation under sub-clause (a) and for both to relate to the same market.</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The importance of treating mitigation sales under sub-clauses (a) and (c) consistently and to have regard to what can be done in actual mitigation when considering what should be done in deemed mitigation is borne out by the treatment of damages in the House of Lords decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Bremer Handelsgesellschaft GmbH v Vanden Avenne Izegem PV BA </span>[1978] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 109. One of the issues in that case was the date of default under the then version of the GAFTA default clause. The sellers were in default and the choice was between the date on which the default was made or the date on which it could first be said that the seller was in default. The House of Lords decided it was the latter because the provision allowing the buyer to buy in the market could not be exercised until that date. As Lord Wilberforce stated at p 117:</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Fourthly, it is consistent <span style="color:#000000">with </span>the compensatory principle. The imposition of the tariffs had significantly increased the value of the goods in the domestic market in India. The Sellers were in a position to take advantage of that uplift in value when they were left with the goods in Mundra and it is reasonable to assume that their associated company did so. That is a benefit which should be brought into account on the assessment of damages in accordance with the compensatory principle. It is also consistent with the principle of mitigation. If an arms-length mitigation sale into the domestic market had been made and established the default price then the uplift in value would have reduced the damages. A deemed mitigation sale should do likewise.</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Conversely, the Appeal Board’s approach to damages is contrary to the compensatory principle as it leaves out of account the fact that the Sellers were left with goods on their hands which had benefited from a significant uplift in value. The Sellers argued that this uplift was irrelevant as it was not accrued by virtue of the terms of the contract. What matters, however, is the fact of the uplift, not its cause. There are any number of reasons why the market price may rise or fall and there is no principled reason for distinguishing between different reasons for it doing so. The resulting benefit may flow in either direction but it should be taken into account. </p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Fifthly, it is consistent with the findings made by the Appeal Board relating to other aspects of damages. For example, the Appeal Board found that the date of default was not, as would usually be the case, governed by the Seller’s declaration of default but rather was 2 February 2018 as “the goods were not available to Sellers to resell until 2 February 2018”. Until “they were able to obtain possession of the goods” “it was clearly impossible for Sellers to resell the goods, and thus establish damages in accordance with the Default Clause”. The Appeal Board thereby recognised that the damages recoverable were necessarily linked to the ability of the Sellers to resell the contract goods. But this logic applies to place as well as time. The goods became available to Sellers to resell on 2 February 2018 at which time they were stored, customs cleared, in a warehouse in Mundra.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The Appeal Board also recognised that there were benefits for the Sellers in having the goods returned to them as and when they were and that these should be taken into account. The Buyers claimed reimbursement of the costs of discharging the goods. Although the Buyers were responsible for these expenses under the terms of the contracts that claim was upheld because “the goods were returned to Sellers and resold by them”. In other words, the return of the goods to the Sellers meant that they benefited from the fact that the goods had been discharged free of expense to them and the Appeal Board considered that that should be taken into account in relation to damages. The same should apply to other benefits for the Sellers resulting from the return of the goods to them.</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"> The principal contrary argument advanced by the Sellers was that under sub-clause (c) the damages are to be assessed on the basis of a true substitute contract – ie a substitute contract on the exact same terms save as to price. This means a C&amp;FFO Mundra contract or its closest proxy. This is what the Appeal Board did and their decision involved no error of law.</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As explained at para 98 above, where there is an available market for a true substitute contract then that is no doubt the correct approach. However, these passages should not be interpreted as if they are a statutory text. They are not laying down the approach which must be adopted in all cases regardless of the circumstances. There will be many cases where the available market is not for an exact substitute but it will nevertheless be reasonable to rely on that market to establish the default price. A more flexible approach is permissible both at common law and under the GAFTA default clause such as through making reasonable adjustments so as to arrive at a like for like value.</p>

In such cases it will be necessary to look to some other market, usually that at the destination, as the case law illustrates. The guiding principle is that of mitigation and to look to the market in which it would be reasonable for the seller to sell the contract goods.</p>

Following the guiding principle of mitigation, as explained above, the market in which it would have been reasonable to sell the goods was the ex warehouse Mundra market, the market into which the Sellers did in fact sell the goods.</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">This answer assumes that there was an available market for sale of the goods in bulk ex warehouse Mundra on or about the default date. There are suggestions in the Awards that the evidence did not show that there was a market for a sale of the goods in bulk but only of parcels over time which would mean by reference to market prices which would no longer reflect that prevailing on the default date. It may nevertheless be possible to extrapolate a bulk price from the market evidence of prices on the default date. Even if it is not and it is concluded that there was no available market, the estimated value of the goods should be assessed on the basis of the goods as and where they were on the date of default – ie customs cleared in a warehouse in Mundra. Those were the goods which were left in the Sellers’ hands and it is their realisable value that should be used to establish the default price. That reflects the reality of the position in which the Sellers found themselves as a result of the Buyers’ non-acceptance.</p>
