That decision was made by, and the proceedings were brought against, the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. However, with effect from 3 May 2023 the relevant functions have been transferred to the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero and he has therefore been substituted as the defendant.</p>

It was set up on 8 July 2022 by members of a local community group as a special purpose vehicle for the bringing of this claim and to receive public donations to that end. TASC was established in 2013 to oppose the project. It has had about 280 supporters. The group responded to pre-application consultations and participated in the statutory Examination of the draft order.

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">At the time of the Examination, SZC was unable to identify a permanent supply of potable water for the project, because this was to be decided as part of the preparation and publication by Northumbrian Water Limited (“NWL”) of a Water Resources Management Plan pursuant to s.37A of the Water Industry Act 1991 (“the 1991 Act”) for Essex and Suffolk over the period 2025 to 2050 (referred to as WRMP24). </p>

When the station is operating the peak demand will be up to 2,800 m<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">3</span>/day. This is an entirely separate issue from the cooling water needed in connection with electricity generation, which is obtained directly from the sea. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Panel’s Report (“PR”) was submitted to the defendant on 25 February 2022. In its assessment of the benefits of the project as part of the overall planning balance the Panel relied upon the contribution of the power station to low-carbon energy production. It would meet the aim of Government policy to achieve delivery of major energy infrastructure including new nuclear electricity generation. They considered that “there is clearly an urgent need for development of the type proposed” and gave “very substantial weight” to the contribution that the scheme would make to meeting that need (PR 7.5.4). </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Because the project is likely to have a significant effect on “European sites”, an “appropriate assessment” was required to be carried out under reg.63(1) of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (SI 2017 No. 1012) (“the Habitats Regulations”). The Panel concluded that an adverse effect on the integrity of the marsh harrier feature of the Minsmere-Walberswick SPA resulting from noise and visual disturbance during the construction phase could not be excluded (PR 6.4.598). Under reg.64 the Panel advised that there were no “alternative solutions” to the proposed development (PR 6.6.12) and the defendant could conclude that the project must be carried out for “imperative reasons of overriding public interest” (“the IROPI test”). The public interest reasons included the continuing growth in the demand for electricity, the retirement of existing generation capacity, the shortfall in generation of 95GW by 2035, the scale of the need for nuclear new build, the UK’s commitment to the net zero target for 2050, the continuity and reliability of supply delivered by nuclear energy as part of a diverse energy mix and the urgent need for new nuclear power stations (PR 6.7.4 and 6.7.9). The Panel also identified some additional areas where the information before them was insufficient for the purposes of the Habitats Regulations, but those matters do not give rise to any legal challenge.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">However, there remained the outstanding issue about a permanent supply of potable water. The power station could not be licensed by the Office for Nuclear Regulation (“ONR”) under the Nuclear Installation Act 1965 (“the 1965 Act”) and could not be operated without such a supply.  The Panel said that because an assured supply of potable water had not been identified, the cumulative environmental effects of the proposed development and that supply could not be assessed (PR 7.5.7) They stated that they could not recommend approval of the application without additional information and assurance on the provision of a permanent water supply. They regarded this “as an important matter of such magnitude that it should not be left unresolved to a future date” (PR 7.5.8). Subject to the permanent water supply issue, the Panel considered that the benefits of the proposal strongly outweighed the adverse impacts. But in view of that unresolved issue as at the close of the Examination, the Panel considered that the case for the grant of development consent had not yet been made out (PR 7.5.9 and 10.3.1)</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 18 March 2022 the defendant requested further information from SZC, the Environment Agency (“EA”), Natural England (“NE”) and the ONR. The defendant referred to a letter from NWL’s Solicitors of 23 February 2022 advising that the company was unable to meet the project’s long-term demand for water supply from existing resources and that a number of demand management and supply side options were being appraised. The defendant asked SZC to explain the progress being made to secure a permanent solution so that he could reach a reasoned conclusion on the cumulative environmental effects of different permanent water supply solutions (see DL 4.29). </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">SZC responded to that request on 8 April 2022. In summary, they relied firstly upon the duty of NWL under the 1991 Act to identify through WRMP24 new water resources to meet the demand forecast for its region, including Sizewell C. NWL would carry out an integrated environmental assessment of the Plan, including strategic environmental assessment (“SEA”) under The Environmental Assessment of Plans and Programmes Regulations 2004 (SI 2004 No.1633) and a Habitats Regulations Assessment (“HRA”). These assessments would be completed before Sizewell could receive the new supply (DL 4.32). SZC submitted that the long-term planning of water supply was subject to the separate requirements of the 1991 Act and could not yet be identified for the power station (and other developments). Indeed, it could change again during the lifetime of the power station as the water undertaker manages its resources in response to <span style="font-style:italic">inter alia</span> changing demand. In accordance with national policy, the decision under the 2008 Act should be taken on the assumption that other statutory regimes will be properly applied (DL 4.33). SZC submitted that there was insufficient information on the permanent solutions that might come forward for any meaningful assessment to be made at that stage. </p>

SZC considered that such a plant would be unlikely to generate any new or materially different significant environmental effects (DL 4.30 and 4.66). </p>

They raised objections to a permanent desalination plant but offered no comments on the WRMP route. TASC maintained their position that the lack of a guaranteed water supply meant that not all significant environmental effects were being assessed at the development consent stage. </p>

On that basis there was no requirement for an assessment to be made of the permanent water supply solution as a part of the power station project. He then went on to consider the Panel’s view that the cumulative impacts of that water supply should nonetheless be considered at the development consent stage for the power station. The defendant concluded firstly, that a long-term water supply for Sizewell C is viable. Secondly, any proposal for the supply of water by NWL will be properly assessed under the WRMP24 process and other relevant regulatory regimes. Thirdly, no further information was required on that subject for the application for development consent to be determined (DL 4.67). Disagreeing with the Panel, the defendant did not consider the present uncertainty over the permanent water supply strategy to be a barrier to granting development consent for the project (DL 4.68).</p>

Judicial review is the means of ensuring that public bodies act within the limits of their legal powers and in accordance with the relevant procedures and legal principles governing the exercise of their decision-making functions. The role of the court in judicial review is concerned with resolving questions of law. The court is not responsible for making political, social, or economic choices. Those decisions, and those choices, are ones that Parliament has entrusted to ministers and other public bodies. The choices may be matters of legitimate public debate, but they are not matters for the court to determine. The court is only concerned with the legal issues raised by the claimant as to whether the defendant has acted unlawfully. The claimant contends that the changes made by the SIs are radical and have been the subject of controversy. But it is not the role of the court to assess the underlying merits of the proposals. Similarly, criticism has been made of the way in which, or the speed with which, these changes were made. Again, these are not matters for the court to determine save and in so far as they involve questions concerning whether or not the appropriate legal procedures for making the changes were followed.”</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Paragraphs 3.1.1 to 3.1.4 of EN-1 set out the approach for deciding applications for development consent. The UK needs all the types of energy infrastructure covered by the NPS, which include nuclear power, in order to achieve energy security and reduce GHGs dramatically. Applications should be determined on the basis that the need for these types of infrastructure has been demonstrated in the NPS. There is an urgent need for new nuclear power generation which will play an increasingly important role (para 3.5.1). It is Government policy that new nuclear power should be able to contribute as much as possible to the UK’s need for new capacity (para. 3.5.2). New nuclear power stations will help to ensure a diverse mix of technology and fuel sources, increasing the resilience of the UK’s energy system (para. 3.5.3). New nuclear power forms one of the three key elements of the Government’s strategy for moving towards a decarbonised, diverse electricity sector by 2050 (para. 3.5.5). Given the urgent need for low carbon forms of electricity, it is important that new nuclear power stations are constructed and operational as soon as possible “and significantly earlier than 2025.” Accordingly, the sites identified in Part 4 of EN-6 were those considered to be capable of deployment by the end of 2025 (paras 3.5.9 and 3.5.10).</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On 7 December 2017 the Government issued a Written Ministerial Statement announcing a consultation document on designating in a NPS potentially suitable sites for nuclear power stations expected to be deployed after 2025 and before the end of 2035. The Government stated that EN-6 only has effect for the purposes of s.104 of the 2008 Act in relation to a project expected to be deployed before the end of 2025, that is when a station first begins to feed electricity into the national grid. The statement says that s.105 of the 2008 Act applies to EN-6 in so far as s.104 does not. For projects due to be deployed beyond 2025 the Government continues to give its strong in principle support to proposals for those sites listed in EN-6. Both EN-1 and EN-6 contain information, assessments and statements which continue to be important for projects being deployed after 2025.  </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Panel considered that the application for Sizewell C should be assessed under s.105 and that EN-1 and EN-6 were important considerations. There have been no relevant changes in circumstances reducing the weight to be given to those policies. The acceptability of the proposal in terms of planning policy should be assessed primarily against the nuclear-specific policies in the NPSs. The defendant agreed with the Panel (DL 4.4 and 4.5). </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The defendant also agreed with the Panel’s assessment of the need for nuclear power projects, to which he attached substantial weight. Thus, there is an urgent need for new nuclear energy generating infrastructure of the kind proposed at Sizewell. The contribution that the development would make to the delivery of low carbon energy would assist in the decarbonisation of the UK economy in line with the UK’s obligations under the Paris Agreement (DL 4.5 to DL 4.11).</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The main consequence of s.105 of the 2008 Act applying to the determination of SZC’s application was that the presumption in s.104(3) did not apply. Thus, the defendant did not have to decide the application in accordance with the NPS unless one or more of the exceptions in s.104(4) to (8) applied. Nevertheless, it is relevant to note that where s.104 is engaged, the balancing exercise described in s.104(7) may not be used to circumvent s.106(1)(b), which has the effect of preventing challenges to the merits of policy in a NPS in an Examination or before the Secretary of State. So, for example, changes of circumstance after the designation of a NPS are to be addressed instead through the process under s.6 for a formal review of a NPS (<span style="font-style:italic">R (ClientEarth) v Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy</span> [2021] PTSR 1400 at [105]; <span style="font-style:italic">R (Spurrier) v Secretary of State for Transport</span> [2020] PTSR 240 at [106] to [110]). </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There is no dispute that the NPSs were material considerations for the defendant to take into account under s.105 when determining SZC’s application. Section 106 applies to a determination by the Secretary of State under s.105 just as it does to a decision under s.104. Accordingly, the provisions in the 2008 Act preventing challenges to the merits of policy in a NPS were applicable. Although a review of EN-6 under s.6 of the 2008 Act is being carried out, the defendant has decided not to exercise the power in s.11 to suspend either EN-1 or EN-6 pending the completion of that review. </p>

Sizewell C constituted EIA development. By reg.5 “EIA” is a process consisting of the preparation of an “environmental statement” (“ES”), the carrying out of consultation under the EIA Regulations and compliance by the defendant with reg.21. Regulation 21 required the defendant when deciding whether to make the development consent order, to examine the environmental information and, taking that into account, to reach a reasoned conclusion on the significant effects of the development on the environment to integrate that conclusion into the decision on whether to grant the order, and to consider whether it was appropriate to impose monitoring measures.

The local “water resource zone” Blyth WRZ would be unable to supply water to meet the needs of the power station. NWL had identified the possibility of a connection being made to the Northern/Central WRZ which might have sufficient capacity in the River Waveney, subject to completion of NWL’s part of the Water Industry National Environment Programme (“WINEP”) study led by the EA. This would require the construction of a new transfer main from Barsham Water Treatment Works to Saxmundham, a distance of 28km, and other water network enhancements. The proposed transfer main would connect into the local Blyth distribution network at Saxmundham Water Tower and at other locations. “These local connections have the potential to provide significant legacy benefit by increasing capacity and resilience of the distribution network” (para 3.2.3 and DL 4.53). The main would benefit consumers in the local area and not simply Sizewell. There were issues affecting the availability of a sustainable supply across the whole of the East of England, which, if confirmed, would require a strategic response by NWL so that it could discharge its duties under the 1991 Act. Accordingly, longer term plans would need to be put in place by NWL “to serve the region and its committed growth.”</p>

SZC said that there was no reason to think that a new water supply scheme for a “critical NSIP” would not be approved in the 2024 Price Review and every reason to expect that NWL, using reasonable endeavours, would be able to deliver the necessary infrastructure for the permanent water supply connection before the end of construction of Sizewell C (see also DL 4.42).</p>

He concluded that if development consent were to be granted for the power station, there was a “reasonable level of certainty” that a permanent solution could be found before the commissioning of the first reactor.

Instead, they may constitute two projects but with cumulative effects which need to be assessed. The court went on to discuss a second type of salami-slicing ([37]-[38]). It acknowledged that the scrutiny of cumulative effects between two projects may involve less information than if the two sets of works are treated together as one project. Accordingly, a planning authority should be astute to ensure that a developer has not sliced up what is in reality one project in order to try to make it easier to obtain planning permission for the first part of the project and thereby gain a foot in the door in relation to the remainder. But the Directives and jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice recognise that it is legitimate for different development proposals to be brought forward at different times, even though they may have a degree of interaction, if they are different “projects”. The Directives apply in such a way as to ensure appropriate scrutiny to protect the environment, whilst avoiding undue delay in the operation of the planning control system. Undue delay would be likely if all the environmental effects of every related set of works had to be definitively examined before any of those works could be allowed to proceed. Where two or more linked sets of works are in contemplation, which are properly to be regarded as distinct “projects”, the objective of environmental protection is sufficiently secured under the Directives by consideration of their cumulative effects, so far as that is reasonably possible, when permission for the first project is sought, combined with the requirement for subsequent scrutiny under the Directives for the second and each subsequent project.</p>

Sizewell C was initially promoted on the basis that NWL would meet its obligations under the 1991 Act by providing a permanent water supply at Barsham and a transfer main to Saxmundham. Accordingly, the provision of that infrastructure by NWL was not included in SZC’s application for development consent. The present uncertainty about what form the long term supply will take only emerged subsequently. In the circumstances, it is inappropriate for the claimant to say that SZC has caused uncertainty by “keeping its options open”. SZC has had to react to the changing circumstances of the WINEP modelling and NWL’s evolving response to that assessment. SZC has made it plain that it wishes to rely upon the solution that NWL says it will be able to deliver through the WRMP24 process and not upon permanent desalination on-site. On the other hand the defendant’s decision recognises that in the unlikely event of NWL being unable to provide a solution, SZC would seek to provide a desalination plant (DL 4.66). </p>

That case concerned the grant of planning permission for a bridge over a railway line. This is sometimes referred to as “the bridge to nowhere”, because when viewed in isolation it served no purpose. It did not connect to any existing road or development. It was a bridge in the middle of a field.  It would only begin to be used if and when housebuilders obtained planning permission for and developed a link road and housing site. The claim for judicial review had to succeed in any event because the officer’s report wrongly directed the defendant’s planning committee that they could take into account the benefits which would arise from the housing development anticipated but not any of the harm that that development would cause. The benefits of the additional development could not be realised without the concomitant harms. So the decision involved a failure to take into account an obviously material consideration and was irrational (grounds 1 and 2 at [32] to [69]). </p>

This argument relies upon the assertion that “the need for the permanent potable water supply arose from the power station development.” The implication would appear to be that there would be no such need in the absence of that development and so there is interdependence. This was not an argument which appears to have been pursued before the Panel during the Examination or subsequently before the Secretary of State. The claimant has not identified any evidence to support its assertion. Rather NWL stated that they would need to make additional water supplies available to meet the forecast demand and not just the demand from Sizewell C. The defendant had regard to NWL’s obligation to undertake WRMP24 so as to be able to meet its duties under the 1991 Act. Beyond that the defendant took into account the requirement for the permanent water supply to be available before Sizewell C can operate under a nuclear site licence. </p>

The need for the supply of utilities such as water is common to many, if not all, forms of development. A utility company’s need to make additional provision so as to be able to supply existing and new customers in the future does not mean that that provision (or its method of delivery) is to be treated as forming part of each new development which will depend upon that supply. The consequence would be that where a new supply has yet to be identified by the relevant utility company, decisions on those development projects would have to be delayed until the company is able to define and decide upon a proposal. That approach would lead to sclerosis in the planning system which it is the objective of the legislation and case law to avoid (<span style="font-style:italic">R (Forest of Dean (Friends of the Earth)) v Forest of Dean District Council </span>[2015] PTSR 1460 at [18]).</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">Ashchurch</span> the bridge was only going to be constructed in order to serve the wider development in the Masterplan area. As Andrews LJ said, although it was a matter for the local authority to address on a redetermination, it was difficult to see how the bridge could not be treated as an integral part of the wider project ([100]). The unassessed wider project was a real proposal. But there is no obligation to assess a hypothetical scheme (<span style="font-style:italic">Preston New Road</span> at [75]). Here SZC considered that a permanent desalination plant was unlikely to be necessary and was not currently proposing that option. The defendant’s decision that such a desalination plant was not an integral part of the Sizewell C project cannot be faulted. </p>

He suggests that the prior grant of the Order under the 2008 Act will make it easier for the public interest in Sizewell C going ahead to override cumulative harm or, indeed, that that would “automatically” be the outcome. </p>

If a future assessment should show that the water supply option chosen would adversely affect the integrity of a European site, whether by itself or in combination with Sizewell C, IROPI would have to be applied according to the language of the Habitats Regulations and the relevant principles in the case law. It would not be appropriate to take into account the overall <span style="font-style:italic">benefits </span>of Sizewell C without also taking into account the overall<span style="font-style:italic"> harms</span> of that project. The court has not been shown any authority in which deferral of the consideration of the cumulative impacts to a subsequent consent stage has caused the application of the IROPI test to be distorted or biased or watered down in some way. I note that in <span style="font-style:italic">Forest of Dean</span> Sales LJ (as he then was) stated at [19] that the earlier grants of planning permission for the original project in that case created no presumption and added no force to the contention that planning permission should subsequently be granted for the spine road that connected the two sites.

The benefits of Sizewell C could not be taken into account in that future IROPI assessment without also taking into account the disbenefits. I understood Mr. Strachan KC for the defendant and Mr. Phillpot KC for SZC to adopt this analysis.

In my judgement similar considerations apply where a decision-maker is expected to show deference to the advice of an expert body. The level of reasoning which the law expects of a decision-maker disagreeing with the view of an expert body may depend upon whether that view is an unreasoned statement or assertion, or a conclusion which is supported by an explanation and/or evidence. It may also depend upon the nature of the subject-matter.  Some advice may not call for reasoning and/or supporting evidence, other advice may do.</p>

In so far as nuclear power is considered to have particular benefits, those matters ought to have been assessed as part of a wider consideration of alternative methods of generating electricity and their respective benefits. The defendant acted unlawfully by basing his conclusion on too narrow a policy objective, namely to provide additional nuclear power. However, if the defendant was legally entitled to adopt that approach, the claimant does not contend that he failed to assess “alternative solutions” lawfully.</p>

PR 7.5.4 was based in turn upon the detailed assessment in PR 5.19. That section of the Report relied upon the urgent need for new nuclear power to contribute to electricity generation by 2035 (see e.g. PR 5.19.78, 5.19.136 to 5.19.137 and 5.19.163). </p>

Accordingly, it cannot be said that the project’s claimed contribution to addressing the shortfall in 2035 in electricity generation did not materially influence the defendant’s decision on the application of the Habitats Regulations as well as his decision to grant development consent.

NWL reiterated its commitment to providing the supply required for Sizewell C. That would be reliant upon the finalisation of new supply schemes and their identification in WRMP24, the completion of a s.55 agreement under the 1991 Act and “the costs approval process”.

As to the former, the defendant decided that there was no option under the WRMP24 process which could be assessed at the stage when the decision letter was issued. As to the latter, the defendant was sufficiently confident that a solution would be found through the WRMP24 process (after having been subject to environmental assessment) and then completed before the operation of the power station is expected to begin in 2033. It is therefore apparent from the decision letter that there is no inconsistency in the defendant’s reasoning or lack of coherence. The two conclusions are self-evidently compatible.</p>

The Sizewell Coastal Defences Design Report [REP8-096] provides a design description of the HCDF Adaptive Design at section 3.11 and is designed to protect the Proposed Development from a 1 in 10,000 year storm event with reasonably foreseeable (“RF”) climate change effects up to the end of its design life in 2140. The ExA consider that the Applicant recognises that, given the inherently uncertain nature of climate change, the RF climate change scenario may be exceeded. ONR and EA guidance requires that the sea defence be capable of adaptation to a credible maximum sea level rise [ER 5.8.252]. The sea defences have therefore been designed to allow for future adaptation to accommodate the credible maximum scenario, should it develop. The Adaptive Design would provide a simple means of increasing the crest height of the HCDF to reach a crest level of 16.4m OD [ER 5.8.252]. The implementation of measures to enact the Adaptive Design would be driven by progressively observed effects of climate change, specifically mean sea level rise. The MDS FRA [AS-018] confirms that the impacts of climate change on sea level rise would be monitored and assessed at set intervals to determine the trajectory of the projections, and consider whether there is any change from either the current considered projections or the climate change guidance as applied in the application [ER 5.8.253]. A number of issues were raised by IPs in relation to Adaptive design and its implementation [ER 5.8.254 et seq.]. Having considered the submissions and responses from the Applicant [ER 5.8.252 et seq.] the ExA takes the view that as indicated in relation to the SMP, and having regard to the details and explanation provided by the Applicant, that the HCDF, including the Adapted Design, would be positioned as landward as possible. In addition, the requirement 19 in the Order would provide a means whereby the design details of various aspects of the HCDF would require ESC approval in consultation with the MMO and the EA before commencement of that work. The ExA considers that this would provide an appropriate safeguard at detailed design stage in relation to matters relating to layout, scale and external appearance of the HCDF, and its integration with other marine infrastructure [ER 5.8.256].”</p>

The ExA is persuaded [ER 5.20.102] that the Applicant’s conclusions are predicated on the basis that the site will be clear of nuclear material by 2140, the period which has been modelled for coastal defences, and under these circumstances the ExA consider the tests set out in paragraph 2.11.5 of NPS EN-6 would be met.”</p>

In my judgment he was under no legal obligation to do so. The limitations of that material produced in 2020 were obvious on the face of the document itself, without there being any need for the Panel or the defendant to spell that out by simply repeating them. The comments by the ONR related to the Hinkley Point C project in the absence of information on Sizewell C. They were not of any real significance. Naturally the Panel and the defendant would focus on later material produced in 2022 which specifically related to the Sizewell C project (see e.g. [167] above). An application for a nuclear site licence for that scheme had yet to be submitted. SZC said to the Examination that the fuel store would be decommissioned by the 2140s, that is not necessarily by 2140 (DL 4.252). Although the ONR had estimated in 2020 that the GDF would be available by 2130, the claimant relies upon an alternative prediction, 2145, emanating from SZC. The Panel stated that it was reasonable to assume that storage would be available in a GDF in the long term, but added, not surprisingly, that there is a degree of uncertainty (PR 5.20.131), referring no doubt to timing. </p>

But that is not the only uncertainty about the future. The ONR, EA, SZC and others have addressed the possibility that climate change may cause sea levels to increase more quickly. Estimates about the availability of facilities and projections are having to be made an unusually long way into the future. On any fair reading of the Panel’s Report and the decision letter, that uncertainty was recognised. I agree with counsel for the defendant and for SZC that what matters is how that subject was addressed. </p>

It is plain that in DL 4.590 the defendant also relied upon the adaptive nature of the design for the coastal defences, the monitoring of sea levels through the CPMMP and the controls which will be applied by the ONR and the EA through their respective regulatory regimes. That paragraph has to be read in the context of the many passages in the Panel’s Report and in the decision letter where those matters were explained and relied upon. The suggestion by the claimant’s counsel that the defendant did not rely upon those matters when addressing the future adequacy of coastal defences in relation to the storage of spent fuel is wholly untenable. The point was made clear in relation to the ONR and the nuclear site licence, for example in DL 4.365. The defendant relied, as he was entitled to do, upon the normal assumption that those other regulatory regimes will be operated properly. The defendant’s reasoning cannot be treated as irrational or legally inadequate. </p>

The ExA is therefore content that those emissions would not materially affect the ability of the Government to meet the UK’s obligations under the Paris Agreement. Similarly, the gross emissions associated with the operational phase have been found to be less than 1% of relevant periods in which they arise. The ExA also recognises the support provided by national policy for low carbon power generation projects such as the Proposed Development, and that the importance for the UK’s carbon budgets should also be considered from the perspective of the carbon emissions that would otherwise be produced by other sources, if they were not generating.

The Secretary of State notes that paragraph 8 of the letter from Walker Morris on behalf of NWL, of 23 February 2022, provides that, in addition to demand management options, NWL is also appraising other options that include (but are not limited to): an import from Anglian Water; nitrate removal at Barsham WTWs; effluent reuse and desalination; and longer term (post-2035) winter storage reservoirs. The Secretary of State considers that these represent potentially viable solutions for the water supply strategy as would the fall back of the Applicant’s own permanent desalination plant if those solutions cannot be used. The Secretary of State is therefore content that if consent is granted for the development, there is a reasonable level of certainty that a permanent water supply solution can be found before the first reactor is commissioned. </p>

Paragraph 4.10.3 of NPS EN-1 (EN-1), states that the decision-maker ‘should work on the assumption that the relevant pollution control regime and other environmental regulatory regimes, including those on land drainage, water abstraction and biodiversity, will be properly applied and enforced by the relevant regulator.

This guideline notes that the duty to prepare and maintain a WRMP is set out in sections 37A to 37D of the WIA and that a water company must prepare a plan at least every 5 years and review it annually. Part 3.1 of this guideline details the legal requirements relevant to the preparation and publication of a WRMP, including the need to take account of relevant legislation including the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017. Part 3.3.1 notes that statutory consultees for the WRMP process includes the EA, and also notes that if possible options affect a designated site in England then the water company must contact NE. Part 4.1.1 notes that a water company should carry out a HRA as part of the WRMP process, including an appropriate assessment, as set out in the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017 (as amended), if a preferred plan would be likely to have a significant effect on a European site (either alone or in combination with other plans or projects).</p>

As set out below, the Secretary of State has considered the cumulative assessment of the proposed pipeline from the North/Central WRZ and agrees with the Applicant’s assessment that the pipeline is not likely to give rise to new or significant effects to those already identified in the ES. In addition, the Secretary of State agrees with the Applicant that the detail of the potential environmental impacts (including cumulative impacts) associated with the proposed permanent water supply to be provided by NWL will be sufficiently assessed and that the WRMP24 process is the appropriate means of undertaking that assessment. The Secretary of State agrees that further detailed assessment cannot be undertaken by the Applicant at this stage as the preferred option for long-term supply is not yet known given the current status of the separate WRMP24 process, which falls to be considered as a separate plan or project. The Secretary of State considers that it is because the long-term planning of water supply is subject to separate statutory provisions and processes, including those set out in paragraph 4.47 above, that the identification of the source of the Proposed Development’s long-term water supply cannot be known by the Applicant at this stage.</p>

This refers to potable water transfer options and envisages that a supply of potable water via a direct link from Barsham would be provided by Essex and Suffolk Water. Table 1.1 notes that the provision of this link does not form part of the Application, however it provides a cumulative assessment of the Proposed Development with this link at Chapter 10 of the ES Addendum at paragraphs 10.4.229-10.4.250. The cumulative assessment states that “it is proposed that the detailed route alignment of the pipeline will follow existing roads and boundaries where possible” and that “it is anticipated that the earthworks for the cut and fill, and the pipelaying task for the preferred water supply proposal will progress quickly along the route and works would only impact upon a single receptor for a small number of days at most”. In relation to Terrestrial ecology and ornithology it finds that “Given the footprint of the works and the proposed locations for working, ecological impacts would be minimal and avoidable or mitigable” and for all the other impacts assessed concludes that “no significant cumulative effects are anticipated in relation to the preferred water supply proposal and there would be no change to the residual cumulative effects as presented in Volume 10, Chapter 4 of the ES”.</p>

This transfer will also require other water network enhancements, which NWL are currently investigating.

The Secretary of State notes that the letter states that in addition to demand management options, NWL is appraising options including (but not limited to) nitrate removal at Barsham WTWs to reduce raw water quality driven water treatment works outage. While noting that the ultimate source of supply has yet to be identified by NWL, the Secretary of State considers that the information provided demonstrates sufficiently, in principle, the viability of a mains connection pipeline to the Proposed Development if some or all of the supply were able to come from that location.</p>

The Secretary of State has not seen any information at this stage to suggest that a different pipeline connection (if it were to be required) would not be viable or its impacts unacceptable.

The Secretary of State considers that if the pipeline connects to a supply at Barsham it is not likely to give rise to significant environmental effects additional to those already identified in the Environmental Statement, but this will also fall to be re-examined and be subject to assessment once any such pipeline connection is finalised.

This is due to the fact that the specific details of the route remain unknown until NWL identifies the source of the water that the pipeline will connect the Proposed Development to. The Secretary of State considers that such a pipeline or alternative connection cannot be subject to more detailed assessment as part of this Application given it is subject to the WRMP24. The Secretary of State notes that whilst the Water Supply Strategy submitted in January 2021 identified that the pipeline between Barsham and the Proposed Development did not form part of the Application, a cumulative assessment of the Proposed Development with that pipeline was undertaken, and that the Application was accepted on that basis. The Secretary of State agrees that in light of the present state of knowledge, it is not possible for the Applicant to conduct any meaningful assessment of any different solution to emerge from the WRMP24 process but that any such different solution will necessarily be subject to its own assessment before it can proceed.</p>

The policy is also clear that the decision-maker should have regard to the interaction between the proposed project and other plans, and references Water Resource Management Plans as a specific example of such plans. The Secretary of State notes the acknowledgement in Section 4.2 of EN-1 that it is not always possible for all aspects of a proposal to be settled in precise detail. The fact that there is a lack of detailed information available regarding the source of a permanent water supply via NWL means that it is not possible for the Applicant to have assessed the effect, including the cumulative effects of all of the potential means of conveying water to the Proposed Development. The WRMP process is conducted by the water company and is not something that the Applicant can dictate.

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Secretary of State notes the concerns raised by IPs regarding the prospect of a permanent desalination plant. The Secretary of State agrees with the Applicant that further detailed assessment of the impacts associated with a permanent desalination plant would be required if the Applicant were ultimately to pursue this option as part of its water supply strategy which is not the current intention. The Secretary of State has not requested further detailed assessment from the Applicant of this option given that it does not form part of the Proposed Development and the Applicant’s position is that a bespoke permanent desalination plant for the Proposed Development is unlikely to be required. The Secretary of State notes the Applicant’s position that a permanent desalination plant is not likely to generate any materially new or materially different significant environmental effects on the marine environment (see paragraph 2.2.8 of the Applicant’s response to the Secretary of State’s letter of 18 March 2022) and on the terrestrial environment (see paragraph 2.2.10 of the Applicant’s response to the Secretary of State’s letter of 18 March 2022). The Secretary of State has also considered the concerns raised by IPs regarding the fact that the Applicant had previously discounted desalination from its water supply options. The Secretary of State notes that the revision 1.0 of the Applicant’s Water Supply Strategy produced in May 2020 noted that benefits of desalination include potentially short lead times with equipment available for hire, and that it could be useful for temporary top-ups or in times of drought. The limitations of desalination were listed as ‘desalinated water being aggressive in pipe network and may require remineralisation’.</p>

The Secretary of State acknowledges that the Applicant’s position on desalination has therefore changed between January 2021 and September 2021 as a result of new information becoming available to the Applicant regarding the preferred mains connection via NWL. The Secretary of State is content that it is reasonable for the Applicant to rely on revision 2.0 of the Water Supply Strategy submitted during the Planning Inspectorate’s examination of the Proposed Development in light of the new information that became available via NWL in terms of the important role that a temporary desalination plant would play in the overall strategy. The Secretary of State considers that if, contrary to expectation, the Applicant were to seek to provide water from a permanent desalination plant, that would require its own consent and would be subject to further detailed assessment at that stage before it could proceed. Accordingly, for essentially the same reasons as identified above in respect of the other potential solutions to the supply water strategy, the Secretary of State does not consider it necessary for the effects of any such solution to be assessed in more detail as a permanent desalination plant does not form part of the Proposed Development and the Applicant is not relying on it as an integral part of the Proposed Development.</p>

Accordingly, the Secretary of State is satisfied that the issue of a sustainable water supply solution will be subject to control through the nuclear site licence application and a reliable source of water will need to be demonstrated before any nuclear safety related activities can take place. The Secretary of State notes that NWL has included the demand from the Proposed Development in its WRMP24 Demand Forecast and NWL remains committed to providing the Proposed Development with a long term water supply and is therefore satisfied that there is a requisite degree of confidence that a long term solution is deliverable, that any such long term solution will be subject to its own environmental assessment, including any required under the Habitats Regulations, which will consider cumulative and incombination effects before it can proceed, and that the ability to deliver that solution will need to be demonstrated to fulfil the Licence Conditions of any nuclear site licence to enable the Proposed Development to generate power.</p>

However, the Secretary of State does not consider that the source of that supply is an integral part of this application. There is no current certainty as to the final source of the permanent water supply, which does not need to be in place until the early 2030s. The Applicant has carried out a cumulative assessment of the potential pipeline route from Barsham/the North/Central WRZ which identifies that this will result in no new or different significant cumulative effects. However, it is not currently known whether this or some other means of connecting the development to the water supply network will be required and this is something that will only become known through the WINEP process.
