Whilst the boot is in the style of a Spanish riding boot, it was not designed for serious equestrian or country use.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">The proceedings were issued in August 2019 against The House of Bruar Ltd (“Bruar”) and two of its directors. The claim initially included an allegation of infringement of two RCDs: the RCD for the Heeled Regina, and a design for a boot known as the Amira. However, the Defendants admitted infringement of the Amira design in the Defence and Counterclaim, and I do not need to deal further with that design, as such. The Claimants nevertheless said that the admission that the Amira design had been copied showed that the Defendants were willing or had a propensity to copy their designs. When the proceedings were issued, complaint was made about two versions of the Defendants’ boots alleged to infringe the Heeled Regina design. A third boot design came to the Claimants’ attention after issue, leading to an amendment to the Particulars of Claim in September 2019 to add that boot. </p>

The Order and the list of issues did not limit the number of prior designs to be taken into account, which was a matter of some significance because numerous earlier boot designs were pleaded by the Defendants in order to challenge the validity or scope of the Claimants’ rights. At trial, Miss Pickard helpfully identified a narrower range of designs which she said were the most relevant.</span></p>

Mr Fountaine was a wholly credible and reliable witness, as the Defendants accepted. However, they contended that Mr Parker was not a reliable witness, saying that his explanation of the process of designing the Heeled Regina was incomplete or confused, and that he gave various different dates when the design was said to have been made. On the whole, I found Mr Parker to be a credible witness, who was doing his best to explain the design process and I accept that he genuinely believed that the various designs which he had made had different features. However, he was rather unclear about the dates of the various designs, and especially as to the sequence of various design changes in the critical period of October and November 2014. I did not find his difficulty in specifying the relevant dates surprising so long after the event, nor did it lead me to doubt his veracity, but I have concluded that I should not rely upon Mr Parker’s recollections as to dates without some corroborative evidence. The third witness for the Claimants was Mr Duff, a business consultant who sits on the board of the First Claimant. His evidence was not challenged in cross-examination.</span></p>

            <p style="margin-left:0.49in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">The Defendants’ main witnesses were Mrs Lorna Meikle (née Macleod) and the Second Defendant, Mr Patrick Birkbeck. Mrs Meikle is a long-standing employee of Bruar, and has been its ladieswear buyer for around 15 years. Regrettably, I did not find Mrs Meikle to be a reliable witness. For the reasons set out below, I did not believe her evidence on a number of points, and in particular I did not accept her denial that Bruar had copied the Heeled Regina design. I therefore consider it right to treat all of her evidence with caution, save as consistent with any corroborative evidence. I found Mr Birkbeck to be a more credible witness, although there were some gaps in his evidence, for instance as to his explanation of the design process when ordering the Defendants’ Version 3 boot, which differed as between his witness statement and his oral evidence and as to the explanation he gave for the use of F&amp;F’s boots in Bruar’s 2018/19 catalogue, given that the same ‘mistake’ had been made in the previous year’s catalogue, something which he did not seek to explain. In addition, the Defendants relied upon a witness statement of their solicitor, Mr Bevan, who exhibited various documents, and who was not cross-examined. They also served a Civil Evidence notice seeking to rely upon some correspondence between Mr Lazo and Mr Birkbeck.</span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Parker and Mr Fountaine were schoolfriends who at the age of 16 came up with the idea of running their own luxury leather business. After going to agricultural college Mr Parker spent some time working with his godfather’s business, Abarca, which provided him with an introduction to the leather and footwear industries. By about 2012, aged around 21, Mr Parker and Mr Fountaine started trading under the name "Fairfax &amp; Favor.” They imported shoes from Spain and initially sold them through country shows and fairs and it seems that they have had a good measure of success. They decided early on that they wished to sell goods made to their own designs, with Mr Parker having the design and aesthetic input, and Mr Fountaine looking after the business development and administration. The First Claimant company (“F&amp;F”) was incorporated on 7 May 2013 and its turnover has increased year on year; in the year to February 2017 its turnover was just over £3 million, rising to £13.5 million pounds for the 10 months to December 2020. F&amp;F has 42 employees and sells directly through its own website and at events and shows such as Badminton and Burley, as well as through a number of retailers.</p>

It sells traditional tweed and cashmere garments and other clothing and footwear with a rural or country theme, as well as sporting accessories, outdoor equipment, home and kitchenware and Scottish food and drink. It deals in well-known fashion brands as well as products sourced directly from "high-quality artisan producers." The business has an annual turnover of around £30 million and sells from retail premises in Perthshire as well as via an online and mail order catalogue. Mrs Meikle explained that footwear accounted for less than 20% of the ladies' clothing and accessories for which she is responsible, but she did not give any turnover figures for footwear. It is clear that by at least early 2016 Ms Meikle and Bruar were aware of F&amp;F and its products.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">The Claimants’ case (as clarified in its Amended Reply) was that the Heeled Regina boot was designed by Mr Parker, who is an employee as well as a director of F&amp;F. He was not a professional designer, but through working at Abarca had experience of the footwear trade including trade in Spanish shoes and boots. This had, in particular, introduced him to manufacturers in the town of Valverde del Camino, which appears to be a centre of footwear production. There was some contradictory evidence before me as to who had designed some Spanish riding boots made in Valverde, which were popularised by Miss Kate Middleton, the future Duchess of Cambridge, but this was not directly relevant to the matters which I have to decide.</p>

Mr Parker’s evidence was that he wanted to produce a style of boot which was more stylish and elegant, and less rugged, than a boot truly designed for riding. Whilst working for Abarca he had designed a form of riding boot which the Defendants relied upon in these proceedings as relevant prior art (“the Abarca boot”). Then, in around 2013 he designed a boot for F&amp;F which was identified as the “Early Regina.” The Defendants’ case was that the Early Regina was the same as the Abarca boot. It had many of the same features as the RCD but had a flat heel and did not have a rear elasticated panel like the Heeled Regina. The Early Regina was made for the Claimants by Lazo &amp; Duque and was given reference number 1752 by Mr Lazo. It appears to have been offered for sale from at least July 2013.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">Mr Parker said that he subsequently came up with the concept of the Heeled Regina boot, and asked Mr Lazo to make up samples of the design for F&amp;F to consider.  The design process appears to have proceeded in two steps, initially by the production of an intervening design, the “1856.” Mr Parker sent a series of emails to Mr Lazo in mid-October 2014 giving him details of the features of the proposed design. He sent Mr Lazo a photograph of the Early Regina, together with a photograph of a shoe which had the kind of mid-height heel he wanted to use for the boot. A single sample was made of that boot, to which Mr Lazo gave his reference number 1856 (this number may be out of sequence, as later designs have lower numbers, but no point was taken about this). It was never sold, although photographs of it were posted on F&amp;F’s social media on 26 November 2014, stating “Who is loving our new Regina heeled boot?” The 1856 was one of the prior designs relied upon by the Defendants:</p>

By an email dated 15 October 2014, Mr Lazo asked for details of the kind of elastic panel that was wanted, saying that they were making the sample. Mr Parker immediately sent him a photograph showing the kind of panel he wanted, which had 4 parallel leather strips with zigzag edges covering the length of the elastic base.  Later the same day Mr Lazo told Mr Parker that the elastic sample was being made and would be ready the following week. </p>

In another set of emails dated 27 November 2014, Mr Lazo and Mr Parker discussed the price of the boots, which by then had been given reference number 1857 (later they seem also to have been given number 1858). Mr Lazo said that they were going to make patterns and batches of the boots, which Mr Parker wanted for early January. Moreover, Mr Lazo confirmed on 27 November 2014 that the various designs were exclusive to F&amp;F. At some point the flat-heeled Early Regina was also produced with the same elastic panel, and this model was given number 1852.</p>

One such agent, a Mr Pound, began discussions with Bruar in about 2015, offering to supply them with boots. That, and similar exchanges in 2016, did not lead to sales, as Bruar objected to the price of the boots. In early January 2016, Mr Pound sent Mrs Meikle an F&amp;F brochure which (she accepted) would by then have included the Heeled Regina boot, as F&amp;F’s most popular product.</p>

She said that Bruar had previously bought other goods from Dakota. Her evidence was that she ordered samples and stock of Dakota’s existing “Model 94” boot at the MICAM trade show. She said that Model 94 was the earliest of the Defendants’ boots in issue in these proceedings (the “Version 1” boot). It was said by the Claimants to include all of the identified elements of the Heeled Regina design, including the long 4 strips of leather over the elasticated rear panel. However, there was no evidence that the model existed in that form prior to Mrs Meikle meeting with Mr Arroyo, whilst he referred to the boots as “NEW model reference 94” in an email dated 19 July 2017. </p>

Mrs Meikle said that Bruar was keen to sell the F&amp;F boots because they were being asked for them, she thought the range would fit well in Bruar’s catalogue and it would be a good brand to have in the shop, but the problem was the price. However, that is hard to square with the documentary evidence. In January 2018, Mrs Meikle wrote to Mr Arroyo to see whether he would be able to supply Bruar. She speculated that the reason for the previous lack of supply was that “the people who do a very similar boot to the one we asked you for” (which must have been a reference to F&amp;F) might have contacted him and asked him not to supply them. Then Bruar re-ordered some Version 1 boots from Dakota in March 2018, after the MICAM trade show, and asked Dakota to provide samples. In April 2018 Mrs Meikle wrote to Mr Fountaine expressing some embarrassment, but saying that the price of F&amp;F’s boots was not acceptable to the Defendants. She asked whether it was possible to move to a 10% discount and reiterated that unless the 10% discount was possible there was no point wasting his time with a conversation. Mr Fountaine said again that he would be happy to discuss the matter with her. However, she did not revert to him, no further negotiations took place, and no further orders were placed with F&amp;F. Mrs Meikle denied that Bruar’s decision to stop selling F&amp;F’s boots was connected with ordering the Version 1 boots from Dakota but, in the circumstances, it seems to me that the reason for ceasing to take supplies from F&amp;F was not related to pricing but was, as the Claimants suggested, linked to Bruar’s belief that equivalent boots would be supplied by Dakota.</p>

Mr Birkbeck’s evidence was that using the F&amp;F boots in the catalogue when those boots were no longer in stock was a mistake. However, I formed the view that those photographs were included deliberately, as a matter of expediency, as they had been in 2017, because of Dakota’s shortcomings in supplying samples of the Version 1 boots. </span></p>

This apparently led directly to the development of Bruar’s Version 2 boots, which Bruar hoped would put an end to the Claimants’ complaints. I was told that the redesign was discussed at a meeting between Mr Birkbeck and Mr Arroyo in September 2018. Mr Birkbeck accepted that the Version 2 design was a modification of the Version 1 boots. It is unclear to me whether that timing is correct, or whether, as Mr Parker speculated, the Version 2 boots had been designed earlier in 2018, but it matters not. Mr Birkbeck said that a number of changes to the Version 1 design were discussed, but not implemented, and the end result was that Version 2 was the same as Version 1 save that it has only 2 suede strips over the elasticated panel at the back of the boot. In fact, the Version 2 boot shown to me had two small additional changes: it did not include the piping around the top of the boot present in Version 1, and the colour of the lining had been changed from an ochre colour to orange (whilst the colour forms no part of the claim, I understand that F&amp;F’s boots are lined in orange). </span></p>

Whether or not by coincidence, they visited Lazo &amp; Duque. Mr Birkbeck said that it was only when they met Mr Lazo that they realised that Lazo &amp; Duque had made the Heeled Regina boot for F&amp;F, and Bruar chose them to make the Version 3 boot. </p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">Mr Birkbeck said that they based the Version 3 boot on existing Lazo &amp; Duque designs, rather than on the Heeled Regina. Certainly, in an email of 24 April 2019 to Mr Lazo discussing the new design Mr Birkbeck referred to two design numbers: number 1727 which is one of the earlier designs relied upon by the Defendants, and number 1969, which was not in evidence. However, Mr Birkbeck accepted in cross-examination that the Heeled Regina was “absolutely” in his “thought patterns” when ordering the Version 3 boots from Lazo &amp; Duque. No doubt that explains why the Version 3 boots have a gusset with full length suede panels over it, identical in concept though not in placement to the Heeled Regina. The gusset is located on the inside of the boot, and the vertical leather strips are adjacent to the centre side seam, and separated by a wider roughly triangular panel from the back seam. The front of the boots is made in a single piece, like the Heeled Regina, rather than like the split front of the Version 1 and 2 boots. The tassel is rather longer than on the Defendants’ earlier boots:</p>

The exchanges on 27 November 2014 show that prior to that date Mr Lazo had identified the design, attributed a design number to it, and accepted that it had been made exclusively for F&amp;F.  There was no suggestion that the design was recorded in a design document, and the evidence did not clearly establish when the first sample of the Heeled Regina was made. However, by 27 November Mr Lazo was ready to make patterns and batches of the Heeled Regina, and so, on the balance of probabilities</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">, </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">it seems to me that a sample would have been made before that date, most likely when Mr Parker visited the factory earlier in November 2014.

I conclude that the subsistence of UKUDR in the Partial designs needs to be tested as at October 2014, and in the Heeled Regina design as at November 2014 (and prior to 27 November).</span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">The Defendants concentrated their attack on the subsistence of the UKUDR upon the issue of whether the designs were commonplace in the sense explained above. They pleaded numerous earlier boot designs in support of their contention that the Heeled Regina design and the Partial designs were commonplace, and consisted of a combination of commonplace features. I was provided with pictures of the earlier boots, of varying degrees of clarity, but there was no direct evidence from anyone familiar with those designs, other than from Mr Parker who was familiar with some of the boots.  The Defendants restricted their arguments at trial to 5 earlier designs. Those, and many of the other designs pleaded, share a number of features with the F&amp;F designs in issue, such as a tassel hanging from the zip pull and a perforated or decorated fan shape at the top of the boot, which I gather are typical features of a Spanish riding boot. However, the Defendants did not contend that any of the earlier boots had all of the features of the Heeled Regina. I shall consider the five boots in what I believe to be their chronological order.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">The first of the boots relied upon was style 1620, a knee-length Spanish riding boot shown in the Lazo &amp; Duque 2010 catalogue. Whilst it had the fan detail and a tassel, and an angled if not curved zip, it had a flat heel and a heavy sole, and looked rugged and utilitarian. Mr Parker commented upon the narrower leg of his designs, and I consider that the 1620 looked markedly wider around the ankle than the Heeled Regina and the Partial designs, as well as being much heavier overall. The Defendants relied upon the 1620 in particular for some elastication at the back of the boot which is just visible in the catalogue. However, what one can see is a crinkled or gathered panel on the back half of the outside of the boot; it is not clear whether it extended around the whole of the back of the boot, or just to the centre back, nor is it clear whether the panel was made of or covered in leather. The 1620 may (I cannot be sure) have had the same concept as the Heeled Regina of elastication along the full height of the boot, at the rear of the boot, but this took a very different form and looked very different to the elasticated panel of the Heeled Regina.</p>

This was again very different to the designs in issue, in being a flat heeled, thick-soled, heavy and utilitarian looking boot. The Defendants relied upon it because it too had an elasticated panel, probably, although not definitely, with thin strips of leather attached to it. However, it seems from the photographs in evidence that the panel was just on the outer side of the boot, rather than at the centre back of the boot. It did not extend to the full height of the boot, but only to around mid-calf level, and had a curved edge.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">Next, the Defendants relied on another Lazo y Duque boot from 2013 called the “Bota Kate.” This had a slightly slimmer profile than the 1620, and a slightly higher heel, but I would again describe it as a low-heeled boot. Its sole looked thicker than the Regina designs, though much less rugged than the sole of the 1620. It seems to me that the photograph in evidence may show stitching running down the centre of the front of the boot, but this may be a fault in the reproduction of the image. Certainly, the evidence showed no sign of any elastic panel, at the back or otherwise. </p>

He claims (rightly or wrongly, as Mr Lazo also appears to have made this claim) to be the maker of the Spanish riding boots sold to the Duchess of Cambridge. The Defendants produced some pages from the Cejudo website from February 2014, showing thumbnails of a range of boots and other leather goods for sale. As the Claimants pointed out, the website appears to show that Mr Cejudo will make boots to order, combining features shown on the site<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">.</span> The Defendants amended the Defence to rely upon this boot:</p>

The video was of poor quality, and I am not convinced that the boot shown in it, which Mrs Meikle said appeared to have an elasticated gusset at the back, was the boot above, as it seems to me to have a lower heel.

It is not possible to see any form of elastication at the back of the boot. Mr St Quintin suggested that the Cejudo boot did not have a sloping top like the Claimants’ designs, which may be right, it is hard to be sure. There are also double lines of stitching around the heel piece and full length vertical strips of leather on each side of the zip which in my view are quite prominent.</p>

It was only just before exchange of witness statements in February 2021, when Mr Bevan was looking for a document to exhibit to Mrs Meikle’s witness statement to give an introduction to Valverde, that he found an article (from Die Welt, in German) which mentioned Mr Cejudo, which led Mr Bevan to find the website page showing the boot relied upon. Mrs Meikle, who said that she was familiar with Valverde and its artisan producers, plainly knew nothing about Cejudo. Mr Parker, who had visited Valverde on a number of occasions, also said that he had never heard of Mr Cejudo.</p>

However, in my judgment the fact that neither the Cejudo website nor the particular boot relied upon came to the Defendants' notice whilst carrying out their extensive research prior to filing the Defence, supports the conclusion that the Cejudo boot design was obscure. That view is reinforced by the fact that neither Mrs Meikle nor Mr Parker, both of whom were very familiar with Valverde and its manufacturers, knew of Mr Cejudo, let alone that boot. In my judgment, the Defendants have not shown that this boot might have been ‘current in the thinking of designers in the field at the time of creation of the designs.’ In the circumstances, in my judgment it is not to be taken into account as prior art for the unregistered designs. </span>If I am wrong about that point, the fact that it had no elastication means that it would not affect the findings below as to the validity of the Heeled Regina design.</p>

As may be seen from the photographs above, this had many of the same features as the Heeled Regina, save for the gusset at the back. It was developed from the Early Regina and, as I have explained above, was the forebear of the Heeled Regina. The Defendants said that the Early Regina was the same as the Abarca boot, and some of the photographs of <span style="font-style:italic">that</span> boot show that, when worn, it is loose fitting, and creases or wrinkles around the ankle.  Mr Parker said that both the 1856 and the Abarca were wider boots than the Early Regina or Heeled Regina. It is not easy to resolve that dispute from the photographs in evidence, but on balance it does seem to me that the Abarca boot looked wider than the Early Regina but the 1856 had the same or much the same profile as the Early Regina (in its non-elasticated form). The emails in which Mr Parker asked Mr Lazo to make the 1856 do not refer to slimming the shaft of the boot, only to the sole and heel. However, the Heeled Regina appears to me to have a slimmer profile than the 1856, facilitated by the elasticated panel. In the circumstances, I accept Mr  Parker’s evidence that the 1856 was a wider boot than the Heeled Regina. </p>

In contrast, the narrow strip of leather over the centre seam on the back of the 1865 boot runs only from the heel piece to the cuff which encircles the whole of the top of the boot. Mr Parker suggested that the new feature tended to elongate the appearance of the boot, and I accept that it does so.</p>

The 1856 was never sold, probably because it was overtaken by the full Heeled Regina design, but, as I have said, photographs of it were posted on F&amp;F’s social media on 26 November 2014. </p>

I do not accept that submission. In my view, the Partial designs are not simply a copies of any previous design(s). Whilst they may have been closely based upon the Early Regina, in my view, producing the design did require some design input in terms of the choice of the heel and sole.

Apart from the Early Regina, the Bota Kate was perhaps the closest overall, with a heel that was low rather than flat, and a medium sole. If the Cejudo boot should (contrary to my finding above) also have been taken into account, I do not consider that it advances the Defendants’ arguments. It has a heel of much the same height as the Partial designs, but the zips are noticeably different, the sole looks thicker, the boot looks ‘clompier’ and the Partial designs lack the prominent buckle on the Cejudo.</span></p>

Raising the heel height and changing the sole of the boot to create the 1856 boot required, it seems, relatively simple changes, substituting well-known and commonplace components for the heel and sole of F&amp;F’s existing boot, in contrast to the work done to produce the Heeled Regina design. There was no evidence that the profile of the boot was also changed at that point. I have considered carefully whether the new combination of features shown in the 1856 boot did produce a new aesthetic effect, and I have concluded that it did not do so. I do not consider that the 1856 would have excited any particular attention amongst those in the design field. I find that the Partial designs consisted of a relatively simple combination of well-known features, and the combination was commonplace.

However, in my judgment the change to the placement of the elasticated panel takes a significant step away from the Heeled Regina. The back of the boot looks very different to the Heeled Regina, as it has a single strip of leather over the centre back seam (more like the 1856 boot). There is also a noticeable difference on the inside of the boot, where four vertical strips of leather run the full height of the boot and abut the centre side seam, with a wider roughly triangular panel between the strips and the centre back seam. The difference to the elasticated panel of the Heeled Regina was evident on inspection of the boots.

In my view, the Claimants have satisfied the burden of showing that the Defendants had sufficient knowledge that their boots were infringing articles.  Given my findings of deliberate copying, they had reason to believe the goods infringed.</span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">The next issue is whether the RCD is valid. There are, as HHJ Hacon stated in <span style="font-style:italic">Cantel </span>(above) 4 points to consider. First, the design sector. It was common ground that this was to be tested in light of the field of ladies’ boots. Second is the identity of the informed user and the degree of their awareness of the prior art. Again, it was common ground that this was a buyer and/or wearer of such boots. Whilst Mr St Quintin suggested that such an informed user might include a retailer, he was happy to accept that the level of attention which would be paid to the goods would be that of a consumer. Thirdly, I must assess <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">the designer's degree of freedom in developing his design, focusing upon elements in respect of which the designer had more design freedom</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">And lastly, I must compare the RCD with the earlier designs relied upon. </span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">In my judgment, Mr Parker had a very wide degree of design freedom when designing the Heeled Regina. There are innumerable possible permutations of ladies’ boot designs. It is clear from the evidence before me that there are large numbers of designs for ladies’ boots which exhibit a host of different features and combinations of features. Indeed, evidence such as the Lazo y Duque catalogue of 2010 shows many forms of Spanish riding boots, which suggests that even in that sub-category of the appropriate sector here, there is design freedom.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">In addition, the Defendants relied upon another style shown in the Lazo &amp; Duque 2010 catalogue, number 1727. Again, this had the fan detail and a tassel, and an angled if not curved zip, but it too had a flat heel. The design overall had a utilitarian look, with a substantial sole, though one which was possibly rather less heavy and rugged than the sole of the 1620. The boot had a relatively wide ankle and no visible elastication.</p>

I consider that they give a very different overall impression to the more elegant RCD, even without considering the impact of the back panel. </p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">The closer designs to the RCD are the 1856 and the Cejudo boot. As for the Cejudo boot, as I have said, this also differed from the RCD, especially in the lack of any panel at the back of the boot, and in the addition of stitching and the buckle. The onus lies on the Claimants to show that <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">the disclosure of that design could not reasonably have become known in the relevant circles in the normal course of business. Plainly, it could in theory have become known, as the design was on the Manuel Cejudo website and there is no evidence that the site was not freely accessible. However, equally clearly, the Defendants’ initial professional searches for prior art did not turn it up, which would suggest that it could not </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">reasonably</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF"> have become known. With some hesitation, especially given my conclusion at paragraph 61 above, I have concluded that given the general availability of trade websites, the Claimants have not satisfied the onus upon them to show that the Cejudo boot had not been relevantly disclosed for the purpose of considering the validity of the RCD.</span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.49in">In my judgment, the informed user knowing the design corpus and interested in the products concerned would understand the vertical lines shown on the back view of the boot in the RCD as indicating strips of the same material as the boot (leather or suede, etc) and many informed users would understand that they indicate the presence of an elasticated panel or gusset. This distinguishes the RCD from both the Cejudo boot (if I am right that it is relevant) and the 1856 boot. None of the 5 earlier designs has any such feature at the back of the boot, and i<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">n my judgment, the unusual rear panel is the feature of the RCD which will most strike the informed user.  </span>The Defendants submitted that the RCD was essentially a minor modification of the 1856 boot, so that the RCD is not valid. I do not agree. I am satisfied that <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial;background-color:#FFFFFF">the rear panel</span> is significantly different to what had gone before, and the impact of the vertical strips or elasticated back panel (if so understood) is such that none of the earlier boots would produce the same <span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">overall impression on an informed user as the RCD. I therefore conclude that the RCD is valid.</span></p>
