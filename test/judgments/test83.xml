            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Force majeure clauses relieve a party from its obligation to perform under a contract on the occurrence of a specified event or state of affairs. Such clauses commonly provide, expressly or impliedly, that the clause cannot be relied upon if the effects of what would otherwise be a force majeure event or state of affairs could be avoided by the exercise of reasonable endeavours by the party affected.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The central issue which arises on this appeal is whether the exercise of reasonable endeavours may require the party affected, if it is to be entitled to rely on the clause, to accept an offer of non-contractual performance from the other contracting party in order to overcome the effects of the event or state of affairs. The majority of the Court of Appeal (Males and Newey LJJ) [2022] EWCA Civ 1406, [2023] Bus LR 355, [2023] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 463, held that it may do so in certain circumstances and that it did so on the facts found by the arbitrators in this case. Jacobs J in the High Court [2022] EWHC 476 (Comm), [2022] Bus LR 473, [2022] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 297, and Arnold LJ, dissenting in the Court of Appeal, held that it could not do so, absent clear wording to that effect. So, according to the majority of the Court of Appeal (overturning Jacobs J, Arnold LJ dissenting), the force majeure clause could not be relied on by the affected party in this case. That party now appeals to the Supreme Court. </p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On 9 June 2016, MUR Shipping BV (“MUR”), a Dutch company, and RTI Limited (“RTI”), a Jersey company, entered into a contract of affreightment based on an amended Gencon form voyage charterparty. MUR was the shipowner (and is the appellant before us) and RTI the charterer. The contract provided for the carriage of about 280,000 tonnes per month, 15% more or less in RTI’s option, of bauxite in bulk in lots of 30,000 tonnes up to 40,000 tonnes, 10% more or less in MUR's option, from Conakry in Guinea to Dneprobugsky in Ukraine, between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2018. The monthly quantities and the loading rate meant that, in practice, there would be a continuous flow of vessels loading at Conakry, and a corresponding flow of freight payments from RTI to MUR. The specified freight payments were to be made in US dollars. </p>

That was because, although RTI’s contractual obligation was to pay US dollars, MUR should have accepted RTI’s offer to pay in euros which would have been credited to MUR in US dollars as soon as the euros were received.

Jacobs J rejected this argument, observing that there was no authority supporting it.

In his view, <span class="fontstyle01" style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:13pt">an “event or state of affairs” is not “overcome” by an offer of non-contractual performance.

He considered that in such circumstances the party invoking the clause would not be required to accept that offer. This was because the party invoking the clause was entitled to insist on contractual performance by the other party and, if the parties to the contract intended a force majeure clause to extend to a requirement to accept non-contractual performance, clear express words were required.

The majority of the Court of Appeal was mistaken to cloud the answer to a clear-cut question of general principle with uncertain inquiries into whether, on the facts of individual cases, the purpose underlying particular contractual obligations has been achieved or detriment has been suffered.

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The majority of the Court of Appeal considered that it was dealing with an issue of interpretation that turned on the specific terms of clause 36 and, in particular, the use of the word “overcome” in the reasonable endeavours proviso. This was disputed by MUR who submitted before us that reasonable endeavours provisos are commonly found in force majeure clauses, either expressly or impliedly, and in materially similar terms to the clause in this case. It followed that the issue raised is one of general application which should be addressed as a matter of principle.</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">We agree with MUR. It is well established that a force majeure clause will generally be interpreted (or a term will be implied to the same effect) as applicable only if the party invoking it can show that the event or state of affairs was beyond its reasonable control and could not be avoided by the taking of reasonable steps. We are therefore not dealing with an unusual feature, but rather a very common feature, of a force majeure clause. </p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">We accept the submission of Mr Eaton KC that the underlying reason why a force majeure clause is interpreted as applicable only if the party invoking it can show that the event or state of affairs was beyond its reasonable control, and could not be avoided by the taking of reasonable steps, is one of causation. A party is excused from performance by a force majeure event where the failure to perform is caused thereby. It will not be so caused if the affected party can reasonably prevent the failure of performance. In such circumstances the cause of the failure to perform will be the affected party’s inadequate response to the force majeure event rather than the event itself. </p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">It follows that force majeure clauses in general, and reasonable endeavours provisos in particular, concern the causal effect of impediments to contractual performance. To be able to rely on the clause, and subject to there being clear words to the contrary, the party affected must be able to show that the force majeure event caused the failure to perform. That means establishing that the failure to perform could not have been avoided by the exercise of reasonable endeavours. Contractual performance means performance of the contract according to its terms. Failure to perform means failing to perform in accordance with those terms. The causal question is to be addressed by reference to the parameters of the contract. </p>

It is reasonable steps towards that end with which the reasonable endeavours proviso is concerned. It is concerned with the steps which the affected party should have reasonably taken to enable the contract to continue to be performed. It is not concerned with the steps that could or should have been taken to secure some different, non-contractual, performance. The object of the reasonable endeavours proviso is to maintain contractual performance, not to substitute a different performance.</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In the present case, the relevant contractual performance was payment in US dollars. The impediment to performance was banking delay resulting from the imposition of sanctions. Under the reasonable endeavours proviso the relevant question is whether the exercise of reasonable endeavours by MUR would have enabled the payment of US dollars to be made without delay. This is the only way in which the impediment to contractual performance could have been “overcome”. So, for example, if a specific licence for continued performance of the contract by payment of US dollars could, and should, reasonably have been obtained then the impediment to performance would likely have been overcome. Making arrangements for non-contractual payment does not, however, enable the contract to be performed. The impediment to contractual performance remains and is not affected thereby, still less overcome. The banking delay for US dollar payments resulting from the imposition of sanctions remained in place and was not “overcome” by offering non-contractual performance. Put another way, it would be absurd to say that MUR caused the non-performance of the contract by failing to accept an offer of non-contractual performance. </p>

As is expected and indeed necessary, the contract set out when and how payment of freight was to be made. As is common in international trade, the currency of payment was US dollars. RTI was obliged to pay freight in US dollars and MUR was entitled to refuse any tender of payment which was not in US dollars.

The effect of RTI’s argument is that, in certain circumstances, the reasonable endeavours proviso required MUR to forego that valuable right and accept the offer of non-contractual performance. But, in our view, in principle a party should not be required to do so unless the contract makes clear (whether expressly or by necessary implication) that the party has given up that right. Indeed, one may regard it as a general principle of contractual interpretation that parties do not forego valuable rights without it being made clear that that was their intention. </p>

Thus clause 36.2 provides that, following the end of a force majeure event, “the Parties shall consult in good faith to make such adjustments as may be appropriate to the shipment schedule”. The parties thereby recognised the need for clear provision to be made for there to be any contractually required change in contract terms. The same applies to either of the parties being required to accept an offer of non-contractual performance.</p>

The determination of what constitutes “reasonable endeavours” in that example involves an evaluative judgment. But that evaluation is geared towards achieving contractual performance: it is concerned with reasonable efforts to overcome the sanctions by achieving payment in US dollars.

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Counsel for RTI sought to present her submissions as ones that reasonable business people would favour; and at first sight some may think it an attractive feature of her submissions that they appear to favour reasonableness (and one might add “justice”) over certainty. Indeed, Arnold LJ said at the start of his dissenting judgment in the Court of Appeal, at para 66: “On the facts of this case, MUR’s position has no merit”. With respect, we consider that statement, and the dichotomy in this context between reasonableness and certainty, to be misplaced. It is not in dispute that “reasonable efforts” import some degree of uncertainty. But for that concept to be allowed to ride rough-shod over the required contractual performance would be to introduce unwarranted uncertainty and would thereby, it might be said, undermine the expectations of reasonable business people. It is not unmeritorious or unjust to insist on contractual performance, all the more so if being precluded from doing so would introduce uncertainty contrary to the expectations of reasonable business people.</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">Two final points should be emphasised about the certainty that being tied to the contract provides. The first is that it is not in dispute that, by clear wording, the parties can themselves provide for reasonable endeavours to include accepting an offer of non-contractual performance from the other party (see para 46 above). Secondly, there is often some flexibility in the very notion of what counts as contractual performance. On these facts, the position would have been different if RTI had been able to perform the contract by paying in either US dollars or euros. But it is now common ground that the contract required payment in US dollars and the importance of certainty is maintained so long as the reasonable endeavours proviso is interpreted as focusing on that as the relevant contractual performance.</p>

The charterers nominated Regent’s Canal before the vessel left the Tyne. They nominated that berth because the coal was being sold to a company which required the coal to be near Regent’s Canal. There was an exceptions clause in the charterparty which included delay occasioned by strikes. The vessel sailed on 10 February at 01.00. At 12.00, the Regent’s Canal coal porters began a strike. The charterers learned of the strike at 16.00 the same day. The vessel arrived at Regent’s Canal on 11 February but the coal could not be unloaded because of the strike. On 16 February the charterers ordered the vessel to Beckton, which was one of the other berths named in the charterparty and where there was no strike. The coal was unloaded at Beckton on 19 February. The shipowners claimed demurrage for the delay in unloading. The essential question was whether the exceptions clause covering strikes excused the charterers for the delay in unloading. </p>

And, at first instance, to a question posed by Pollock B, the jury had answered that, because the charterers knew of the strike, it was not reasonable for the charterers to order the vessel to Regent’s Canal. But Pollock B had reasoned that what mattered was that the charterers had a contractual right to order the vessel to Regent’s Canal and they were not required to give up that right even if it was reasonable to do so (and despite the fact that there was an option in the charterparty for the charterers to order the vessel to a berth where there was no strike).

The charterers had an option of loading up to one-third of barley and up to one-third of flour. The owners of the “Queen City” gave notice of readiness to load on 18 February. On 16-17 February a strike broke out at the grain elevators in Vancouver which lasted until 7 May. The strike prevented a full cargo of wheat being loaded until 12 May. The shipowners claimed demurrage for the delay in loading. There was an exceptions clause covering strikes and the essential question was whether that exceptions clause excused the charterers for the delay in loading. In particular, were the charterers required to exercise their options to load one third barley and one third flour along with one third wheat (which, for the purposes of the argument, it was assumed was available) instead of insisting on the full cargo being wheat? </p>

Considering themselves to be “over a barrel”, the defendants went ahead and paid the £4,500 as an additional sum over and above the agreed contract price. The workers were paid, called off the strike, and the work was completed. After the completion of the work, the defendants deducted £4,500 from the contract price owing and sent a cheque for the balance to the claimants. The claimants sued the defendants for £4,500 and the defendants argued, as a defence, that that sum was not owing because they were entitled to repayment of the £4,500 as paid under economic duress. The Court of Appeal held that economic duress was here established so that the defendants were entitled to deduct the £4,500. </p>

But the Court of Appeal made clear, relying on <span style="font-style:italic">Bulman</span>, that, even if there had been no such express words requiring “every effort”, the requirement to use “reasonable efforts” would have been implied.

If they could rely on the clause, there would be no threatened breach of contract. But it was decided that the clause could not be relied on because reasonable efforts had not been taken by the claimants to avert the strike. On the facts, it would have been reasonable for the claimants to accept the offer of partial advance payment made by the defendants. However, the claimants had unreasonably refused that offer and insisted instead that the payment should be an additional sum over and above the contract price. As Griffiths LJ said at pp 426-427:</p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view, however, this is a weak authority in support of RTI’s case. This is for three linked reasons. First, there was no discussion by the Court of Appeal of the performance being non-contractual and of the relevance of <span style="font-style:italic">Bulman </span>to that issue. Secondly, the clause expressly referred to “variation” of the contract. Thirdly, and most fundamentally, the offer made was not to render a non-contractual performance in any real sense. Rather it was to render the contractual performance earlier than required. The defendants were simply offering to pay in advance the money that they were bound to pay anyway under the contract. The contrast with the facts of our case is clear. RTI was not offering early contractual performance. It was offering non-contractual performance. So it was that RTI supplemented its offer to pay in euros by the offer to indemnify MUR for loss caused by the non-contractual performance of not paying in US dollars. Plainly in <span style="font-style:italic">B &amp; S Contracts </span>there was no possible detriment to the claimants in being paid early so that what was being offered was in effect full performance and, in contrast to our case, there was no conceivable loss that required indemnification. </p>

The claimants failed to pay on time for the first delivery of silk that they had received although they had sent a cheque which never arrived and a further cheque that was delayed. When the claimants then gave the next order for delivery, the defendants refused to deliver unless the claimants paid cash for each order. The claimants refused to do this and brought a claim for damages for breach of contract alleging that the defendants had repudiated the contract by requiring the new terms, and that the claimants were entitled to damages based on the difference between the now higher price of silk and the contract price. </p>

It is certainly true that, in that context, it shows that the required reasonable steps can include accepting a non-contractual offer of performance by the party in breach. We are conscious that, even in that context, the decision has not been free of criticism: see Michael Bridge, “Mitigation of damages in contract and the meaning of avoidable loss” (1989) 105 LQR 398. However, the important point is that we firmly reject the submission of counsel for RTI that the <span style="font-style:italic">Payzu </span>decision on mitigation is analogous to the situation with which we are concerned. Mitigation is concerned with the remedy of damages once breach has been established. It has little if anything to do with the prior question, with which we are dealing, of whether there has been a breach of the primary obligations under the contract. Put another way, the legal principles and policies applicable to the assessment of (unliquidated) damages are not the same as those applicable to determining what is the performance required under the contract.</p>

In <span style="font-style:italic">The Massalia, </span>a voyage charterparty was entered into to carry iron ore from Masulipatam in India to Genoa. The fastest and usual route would have been via the Suez Canal but that was shut. The vessel therefore took the longer route via the Cape of Good Hope. The shipowners argued that the contract was frustrated, and was therefore terminated, because of the closure of the Suez Canal and that they were instead entitled to payment (above the agreed contract sum) on a non-contractual quantum meruit basis. That argument succeeded. Pearson J held that the charterparty was frustrated because: the Suez Canal route was a term of the contract (p 306); the fact that closure of the Canal was foreseen as a possibility did not preclude the operation of frustration (p 299); and the route via the Cape of Good Hope was a fundamentally different voyage (pp 306-307). </p>

This concerned a time charterparty for a trip from Genoa to India. The vessel entered the Suez Canal and became trapped for several months and, once freed, had to go back and take the longer route via the Cape of Good Hope. The charterers claimed that the charterparty was frustrated and thereby terminated but the owners denied that and claimed the agreed hire. The Court of Appeal held that the contract was not frustrated either by the vessel being trapped in the canal or, once freed, by having to go via the Cape of Good Hope. As regards the latter, <span style="font-style:italic">The Massalia </span>was overruled. While the Court of Appeal agreed with Pearson J that, unless the event had been provided for in the contract, the foreseeability of the event did not preclude frustration, the Court of Appeal disagreed with him that the contract was made radically different by having to take the route via the Cape of Good Hope rather than via the Suez Canal. Pearson J was also incorrect to have decided that the contract had a term requiring that the Suez Canal was the route. In the words of Lord Denning MR, at p 240: </p>

The direct route via the Suez Canal became impossible because of the closure of the Canal and the vessel therefore proceeded via the Cape of Good Hope. The vessel travelled twice as many miles as it would have done had it been able to go through the Suez Canal. The shipowners claimed that the contract was frustrated, and thereby terminated, and that they were entitled to a higher payment than agreed under the contract. With considerable reluctance, Mocatta J held that he was bound by <span style="font-style:italic">The Eugenia </span>and that, therefore, the contract was not frustrated.

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">In our view, these cases, most importantly <span style="font-style:italic">The Eugenia</span>, provide little, if any support, for RTI. This is for two main reasons. First, whether the doctrine of frustration is made out is a different question than deciding on the application of a force majeure clause. While it is true that there is a close connection between the two, because both deal with a change of circumstances after the contract is made for which neither party is responsible, the doctrine of frustration is the default position laid down by law. It sets out a doctrine that is applicable in a narrow range of changed circumstances and has the drastic consequence that the contract is automatically terminated. Force majeure clauses can cover a far wider set of circumstances with a range of different and flexible consequences, including temporary suspension of the contract for a period of time. It follows that, even if it were the general rule in the law of frustration that the doctrine of frustration cannot be made out where the affected party could have reasonably accepted an offer of non-contractual performance, that does not mean that a force majeure clause could not be relied on in the same circumstances. So on the facts of this case, it is not being suggested that the charterparty was frustrated but that leaves open whether MUR can rely on the force majeure clause. As counsel for MUR expressed it in his written submissions, it is “inappropriate to try to draw conclusions about force majeure (or exceptions) clauses from the frustration case-law. After all, if FM clauses simply mirrored the common law of frustration, they would be pointless.”</p>

Rather Lord Denning MR was at pains to make clear that it was not a term of the contract that the voyage had to be via the Suez Canal. He precisely said that the performance only required the customary route at the time of performance to be taken; and the customary route had become via the Cape of Good Hope. What was being offered by the shipowners was a contractual performance and it is incorrect to view <span style="font-style:italic">The Eugenia </span>(or, on the best analysis, <span style="font-style:italic">The Captain George K</span>) as being a case where the charterers were held bound to accept, because reasonable to do so, a non-contractual performance. </p>

The contract contained a force majeure clause which included various events among which was a drilling moratorium imposed by the government of Ghana. It also included a reasonable endeavours proviso. Following the decision of an arbitration tribunal, on a dispute between states, that no new drilling in a particular oil field should take place, the defendant invoked the force majeure clause arguing that, under that clause, the contract for the hire of the rig had been terminated. Teare J held that the defendant could not rely on force majeure as, although there had been a government drilling moratorium that prevented work being carried out in an oil field as intended, it did not prevent the defendant issuing drilling instructions in relation to another oil field. That work had been prevented by the government’s failure to approve a drilling programme, which was not a force majeure event. </p>

That was because the defendant was contractually bound to take up other drilling opportunities even though that may have involved the defendant acting against its commercial interests. It was argued that the defendant’s choice in relation to the giving of drilling instructions was akin to a true option (what Lord Devlin in the <span style="font-style:italic">Vancouver Strikes </span>case called a “business option”) which it was able to exercise purely in its own interests. This argument was rejected.

However, in this case the defendant had an obligation to provide drilling instructions which could be performed in a number of ways; if one way became impossible then the obligation was to give instructions which could be performed in another way. The defendant was not entitled to act purely in its own commercial interests and to ignore those of the claimant. Teare J cited and applied the words of Lord Devlin in </span><span style="font-style:italic;color:#242021">Vancouver Strikes </span><span style="color:#242021">set out at para 72 above: “the consequence of damming one channel is simply that the flow of duty is diverted into the others and the freedom of choice is restricted”.</span></p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">The recent case of <span style="font-style:italic">Gravelor Shipping Ltd v GTLK Asia M5 Ltd</span> [2023] EWHC 131 (Comm), [2023] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 239 <span style="font-style:italic">(“Gravelor”)</span>, concerned bareboat charterparties of two ships. The charterparties were financing leases under which the charterers had an option to purchase the vessels from the owners. Clause 18.3 of the charterparty provided that, once certain sums had been paid, title in the vessels was to be transferred to the charterers. The charterers wished to purchase the vessels but the parent company of the owners was made the subject of EU and US sanctions which meant that the charterers faced difficulties in making payment to the owners. Under clause 8.10, where a payment was incapable of being processed by the relevant bank because of sanctions against the owners, the charterers and owners were to “cooperate and promptly take all necessary steps in order for the payments to be resumed.” </p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">On a summary judgment application by the charterers seeking specific performance of the owners’ obligations to transfer the vessels, one of the issues raised was whether the charterers had fulfilled their payment obligations. Foxton J (at paras 69-93) decided that there was a valid payment by the charterers even if it was made into a bank account from which the owners would have great difficulty accessing the funds because of the sanctions imposed. This was so even though he accepted that to treat the payment as validly made, when it could not be withdrawn, would mean that the owners would suffer real prejudice. But in any event, he held that clause 8.10 required the owners to nominate a new bank account and to accept payment in euros instead of US dollars. Following the majority decision of the Court of Appeal in this case, Foxton J reasoned that it did not matter that this would involve the owners accepting a non-contractual performance. As the payment had been validly made, the charterers were entitled to specific performance of the obligation to deliver the vessels. </p>

            <p class="ParaApprovedLevel1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">There are at least two points of significant distinction between <span style="font-style:italic">Gravelor</span> and the present case. First, the sanctions clause in question, clause 8.10, was much more specific and targeted than the general force majeure clause with which we are concerned. Not only was it confined to dealing with sanctions, it was also directed to the payment obligation. Secondly, in contrast to the “reasonable endeavours” clause relating to the affected party in our case, the sanctions clause was directed to both parties having to “cooperate” and to take “all necessary steps” in order for payments to be resumed. </p>

In any event, Foxton J was bound, as a matter of precedent, to apply what the majority of the Court of Appeal had laid down in MUR so that his judgment should not be read as providing independent support for the majority’s approach in this case. </p>
