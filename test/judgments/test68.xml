The first respondent is the children’s mother F.  The mother is represented by Mr Howling KC and Ms Mallon.  She opposes the applications and wishes to have the children returned to the care of the father, G, and herself.  In the alternative, for A, B, and C to remain in their current placements but opposes a placement order for D come what may.  As an alternative for D, she suggests longterm foster care, possibly with A.  The second respondent is G, who is the father to B, C and D.  The father is represented by Ms Grocott KC and Ms Howard.  He wishes for all four children, and, certainly, B, C and D to return to live with the mother and himself.  </span></p>

A made the 999 call.  The three sibling children were removed by police and placed in police protection.  There was a police investigation into child neglect.  The mother and father were believed to be under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.  The home conditions were very poor, drug and alcohol use evidenced and a lack of appropriate supervision.  I have seen bodycam footage of the scene in the aftermath of J’s death which was a difficult watch.  I have also seen photographs of the state of the premises and the drugs seized.  </span></p>

Feedback from the younger children’s nurseries about their more recent contact with the family and the presentation of the family was very good.  There were no referrals from A’s school or B or C’s nurseries.  However, the Local Authority’s case is that the picture of the circumstances within the family home that was revealed on 1 January 2022 was one of longstanding polysubstance misuse including illegal prescription drug use, complete neglect of the needs of four vulnerable children for a full day, physical risk to children in the home and a lack of care in respect of J, who was a poorly baby suffering from bronchiolitis.</span></p>

The Local Authority does not seek to prove that J’s death was as a result of the parents’ actions.  The pathological evidence does not establish causation of death, at least, in part, because there is an incomplete picture provided by the parents.  The Local Authority argues that the reality is where such serious neglect exists, the worst that can happen is the death of a child and any of the F/G children could have come to serious physical harm on the night of 31 December/1 January, such was the degree of neglect and risk in the home conditions.</span></p>

J had been dead for several hours when she was found.  The post-mortem doctors, O and P, concluded, ‘Cause of death has not been ascertained after thorough autopsy because the history is unclear.  We do not know exactly when the baby was last seen alive, what her exact sleeping position was, what coverings were over her and whether there was any unusual breathing, evidence of high temperature or other symptoms in the hours leading up to her death.  Although there is evidence of a mild viral respiratory tract infection accompanied by a Covid-19 positive PCR testing, we feel this is insufficient to explain death on the balance of probabilities, and, given the other circumstances in the case, cause of death is, therefore, unascertained’”. The evidence of O, consultant paediatric pathologist was obtained in answer to a number of questions.  When asked what she meant by ‘other circumstances’ in the post-mortem, she replied, ‘Maternal intoxication, lack of clear history of circumstances due to the prolonged period of lack of adult supervision of J during the day prior to her being discovered deceases absence of a clear history of her sleeping position, bedding used and position of her body or bedding at the time she was discovered’. In addition, she was unable to opine as to the time of death based on the established rigor mortis, save that it was likely that it occurred at least two hours before J was discovered.  She was unable to give a view on the time of the last feed from the contents of milk in the stomach: ‘I am not aware of the exact volume of J’s final feed.  At her age, a formula feed would usually be 120 to 150 millilitres.  If she drank a whole feed of this size, then most of it had been absorbed or emptied from the stomach before she died and, therefore, she most likely survived for longer than 78 minutes after her last feed.  However, as we cannot estimate with certainty when J died, this is of limited use in determining when the last feed was’.</span></p>

Her engagement with We Are With You is limited and I was less than clear about her future commitment.  On any view, her engagement with services to help address what her leading counsel described as “an addiction” is at an embryonic stage.  She had, as recently as late June 2022, drank to excess with her sister and her presentation was such that the father was driven to call the police.  I accept that that was the day of the inquest into J’s death but knowing of the issues in the case, she had returned to alcohol as a coping mechanism.</span></p>

The proceedings have been ongoing now for some 18 months, albeit only for the lifetime in respect of D.  A coach and horses has been driven through the PLO timeframe and section 32 of the Children Act 1989.

Having regard to any welfare issues involved and, in particular, the delay is, in my judgment, inimical to the welfare of children, it would not deal with the case expeditiously, and the mother had ample opportunity to make such an application much earlier in the proceedings but did not do so until the closing stages of the final hearing.  It would not be a proportionate way to deal with the case as it would involve more delay and expense to the public purse and I already have two experts who deal very regularly with issues like addiction and risk of relapse.</span></p>

The mother is represented by leading and senior junior counsel and has been able to give her own evidence around these issues.  It would not save expense to go down this route.  It would incur it.  The case has already had seven days of final hearing time after a number of case management hearings.  This would require even more court time to be set aside.  In addition, I am not satisfied that it is necessary to direct this additional expert evidence in order to deal with the case justly: section 13 Children and Families Act 2014 and the Family Procedure Rules 25.  I also have regard to the following pursuant to Family Procedure Rules 25.5: it would provide an opinion of an expert presently unconnected with the case to opine of the mother’s risk of relapse into alcohol and drug abuse.  That would be the question for the expert to answer.  Giving permission would extend the court timetable by at least several months to enable the report to be prepared and then the case to reassemble when all participants are available, once the other parties have had an opportunity to put questions and receive answers from the expert and then to set out their written response.</span></p>

In dealing with the parents, she said, in her assessment the father had recognised the Local Authority’s concerns more than the mother.  From the beginning, he had recognised the need to address his cannabis use.  Within the initial assessment, he agreed with the Local Authority’s concerns over neglect and why they were so worried.  Following the initial split from the mother, he appeared forthcoming.  That was when he told the social worker of his concerns over the mother’s alcohol and cocaine use.  He said he was frustrated that she had made comments that she did not remember the day of J’s death and that she had invented her statements.  </span></p>

However, when her mother was involved in the conversation, he was unable to challenge the mother’s views of her own sister.  That suggested that he would not be a protective factor in that sense.  In terms of the mother, at the start of proceedings, the social worker was taken aback at the mother’s inability to recognise the concerns of the Local Authority.  When she challenged her, the mother recognised her alcohol and substance misuse but followed that up with saying that it would not have changed anything anyway.  Then, in the same sense, she said she had no problem, she was not addicted and could easily stop.  </span></p>

She recognised that contact was relatively good though the parents would be regularly late.  She said that the mother only first acknowledged that she could have done things differently after the social worker filed her initial parenting assessment.  Since then, she had accepted that she should not have gone out, drank and taken substances.  </span></p>

On one occasion, Mother said that the father never brought it up whereas the father did say that alcohol and cocaine was the main source of their arguments and this led to physical abuse in their relationship.  The mother’s hair strand testing results were not reassuring.  These proceedings had been ongoing for some time.  This was the predominant issue raised from the beginning.

However, their response was that it was too early to tell which, as we are more than a year post proceedings, the social worker did not feel reassured that abstinence could be achieved and sustained.  At the beginning of the proceedings, the father had said he would seek to abstain from cannabis.  She was also concerned that the father struggles with anxiety and how cannabis helps.  She said it would only make his drug use worse, and if he was to improve his mental health, he would need to deal with his cannabis use.  Similar to the mother, his engagement with We Are With You was sporadic at best.  Again, when contacting We Are With You for an overview of his engagement, they could not provide it due to a very brief involvement.</span></p>

Their view was that it had taken the father a long time to seek help from his GP.  The father was not able to evidence an ability to challenge the mother in front of professionals and, therefore, he was not a protective factor should the mother use drugs and alcohol if the children were to return home.  The social worker also expressed her concerns about the parents’ dishonesty.  For example, in relation to the incident on 29 June 2022.  The father had called the police following the incident when the mother and her sister returned home, both under the influence of alcohol.  </span></p>

The risk to A in the community when exposed to neglect at home and, in particular, substance misuse with the potential for drug dealers coming to the house puts A at risk of exploitation in the community and at risk of using drugs himself through a normalised view of the use of substances at home.  </span></p>

A is a young 15-year-old and the placement operates with the right boundaries around him during his free time.  She said it is important with the permanence plan that the child understands the permanency of the placement.  She said that there would be an impact on A if he returned home, especially where cannabis was used regularly and there was risk of relapse of the mother.  He would be at risk of neglect but also of using substances as it had become normalised.  At present, he was settled in his current placement, there was stability and his emotional needs were being attended to as well as his ADHD.</span></p>

A was settled in placement.  Finding a foster placement for a 15-year-old is very difficult. They would not look to move him as he is settled.  That would also mean D in foster care for all of her childhood, subject to the intrusion of LAC reviews, the stigma of being a looked-after child and so on.  A, on the other hand, would only be in a foster placement for up to three years.  The social worker said that the sibling relationship should be maintained where possible but was mindful of the need for permanency for each individual child.  It would be incredibly sad for D to be separated from the other siblings, and the Local Authority accepted that.  However, unfortunately, they maintained that long-term foster care was not appropriate for a child as young as D.</span></p>

The social worker thought that the paternal grandmother wanted to but could not manage all three children due to her own health needs and was not having contact with D as a result.  If she was to be adopted, she did not wish to build a relationship with her.  The grandmother had refused to move forward with the foster carer assessment in respect of C and B as she thought she would not pass, so, the special guardianship assessment had taken place.  In terms of the question of an open adoption for D, she said the likelihood of ongoing face-to-face contact for the parents post adoption was pretty low.  They were recommending letterbox contact in any event between siblings, parents, and D.  There was a concern about open adoption when parents have contact with siblings as it can lead to placement breakdown.  If D were to be adopted, that would be devastating for C, B and A and the Local Authority would need to put appropriate support in place.  Overall, I found the worker to be an impressive witness.  I considered her to be fair, measured and balanced in her evidence.</span></p>

She accepted that her sister was drunk when she attacked the father and that there were children around.</span></p>

All the text messages simply provide an address for the drugs to be delivered to.  I consider it likely that drug dealers were attending at the property in which the mother was present, based on the text messages.  Even if I am wrong on that, the dangers of giving drug dealers a home address cannot, in my judgment, be overstated.  That, in itself, exposes a risk of significant physical harm to anyone inside the property.  Those risks cannot have escaped anyone who lives on Merseyside, as painful experience shows.  </span></p>

She agreed that the Haribo box with cannabis it was in their bedroom on the floor.  That would pose a risk to children.  At F133, she was referred to a photograph of roll-up cigarettes in an ashtray.  She said that the ashtray would get taken outside and would be brought back in with dogends in it, hence, the picture.  The mother acknowledged a number of failings: coming back and being intoxicated and under the influence of cocaine in the house.  Having come back, she should have left the children alone.  She got J up because she was crying, she said, but she did not wake the father up.</span></p>

It was put to her that the bodycam footage showed her to be under the influence of drugs and inebriated and that A, B and C had been exposed to that.  The mother agreed that what the children were seeing time and time again was harmful to them.  In my judgment, this mother has very little recollection of events during the morning of New Year’s Day 2022.  That, in my judgment, was because she was under the influence of alcohol and cocaine and was either intoxicated or asleep.  I attach no weight to her purported recollection.  I prefer the written evidence of the witnesses V and R given to the police who have both been evasive through their sense of conflict in wanting to protect the mother within these proceedings.</span></p>

He has the right level of support with his outbursts and the children like him.  Whilst he was 15 in January, the mother accepted that his emotional age is not the same as his chronological age.

He said that he and the mother were drinking all the time, or, should he say, “a lot”.  “If we both drank, the children would not be looked after or fed”.  There was a clear recognition of causation of significant harm.  In terms of his non-engagement, he said he attended one LAC review at the beginning.  When he went, he felt as though he was attacked, blaming him for J’s death.  That was why he said he was not going back.  He felt that everybody was blaming him: police, social worker, everyone.  In terms of the family group conference, the purpose of this was to see if the children came home, what plans could be put in place to keep the children safe.

I issued G with a cannabis workbook which he agreed to start working through before our next appointment.</span></p>

It was important that the Local Authority knows if risks are present.  He agreed that he was putting his own needs in front of those of the children.  He agreed that in telling the mother not to tell the social worker about it in case it was held against them, he was putting his own needs before the children.</span></p>

The father agreed that the mother had not binged with drink since 29 June.  They would both drink alcohol, albeit, limited if they go out to watch Everton on the television.  He said that one of the main problems is her sister, T.  He said the mother realises that she is a bad influence on her.  He maintained that the mother does not use cannabis and has never used it.

In dealing with the mother’s test results, she said she could not say how much had been consumed from those results.  If inhaled, then a person could absorb quite a lot of smoke if in the same room as a user.  If ingesting a lot of smoke, then the point is reached when the body starts to metabolise but that cannot be confirmed from hair testing.  Whenever cannabis is consumed passively, the body will inhale it and start to excrete it.  Passive inhalation can lead to metabolism.  On behalf of the father, Ms Grocott KC said that the father did not dispute the results from DNA Legal in respect of cannabis and opiates.  However, he did challenge the finding that he had used cocaine.  She said that cocaine hydrochloride has a very high boiling point and is unlikely to be in the environment.  Inhalation of crack cocaine can do but that is a negative result for that in this case.  Passive inhalation could not cause these results.  If cocaine was in the air and was being breathed in, it is possible for minute amounts to be inhaled but it would not give this result in these findings.</span></p>

It was more likely that the results were caused by consumption of the drug.  She agreed that there are other variables and people can react differently.  She agreed that one has to look at all the other circumstances before supporting direct cocaine use by an individual but that does not take away from her conclusion that cocaine was being consumed.

He was asked if the safety plan suggested that something had happened in the past to generate it.  The father replied that nothing had happened.  It is just because he did not think that somebody who has been drinking should look after children.  Because she was drinking and taking drugs, she should not be around children.  He was asked about the bodycam footage.  He agreed that the mother still looks drunk and under the influence of drugs.  He said that he had said that the mother had made up her statement.

Based on what she had read and heard, all four children would be at risk of significant harm if they were returned to their parents’ care.  She said she did not believe that the situation could be safely managed.  She had read the notes of the family group conference and heard proposals but, in light of the risks, the lack of honesty and openness of the parents, she did not think it would safeguard the children.

She said that there was no evidence of significant drug use over a longer period of time, including the run-up to the night in question.  There was also drug use during the course of proceedings and levels of dishonesty.  The risks are based around the mother’s drug and alcohol use.  Although she accepted that the last test was negative, she did not have confidence that the mother would maintain that change.  She is still drinking some alcohol and she struggles to do that if not to excess.  Alcohol, for the mother, carries the threat of cocaine use, historically.  She has a long history of drug and alcohol misuse.  This goes back to 2008.  er, cocaine use goes back 13 years.  She is concerned over the mother’s ability to abstain.  The mother herself expressed concern about her ability to abstain and felt as though she needed support.  </span></p>

His use of codeine and the fact that he has been obtaining that without prescription, notwithstanding he has a prescription now regarding that, there are concerns about him obtaining additional painkillers above the prescription drugs and how that would impact on his parenting ability.  In addition, the Guardian was concerned about the ability of both parents to adequately and safely parent the children.  The Guardian said that what we saw over New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day was that neither parent was capable of providing safe care.  The evidence shows that this was not a one-off incident.

For the parents, it impacts on their ability to parent and respond. That is harmful for children.  To have both under the influence is harmful to children.  The Guardian said she believed that neither parent was capable of responding to the children in that state.  She said that she believed it was highly likely that the mother had returned under the influence of alcohol on previous occasions and would do so in the future.  The difficulty, in this case, is that it would seem that neither parent can say, as a result of being on substances, when J was last fed, last seen alive, and this was a child who was poorly.  Even if, overnight, the parents should make sure that they are able to safely care for a child.  At least one should not be under the influence of drugs and/or alcohol.  The parents have no idea when they last saw her when she was fed, and there was a period when neither accepted having the child in their care.</span></p>

We Are With You have been concerned over the lack of engagement, commencing late and missing appointments.  It was too early for them to comment on the risk of relapse.  The Guardian said that, based on other cases and the history of this case, in terms of having a wholly accurate prediction, it is difficult, even with a professional opinion.   She was not sure that a psychiatric or psychological report would give the answer.  Whilst the mother had shown some honesty in the witness box, it had come very late.  </span></p>

The Guardian said that that had helped but not made a major difference.  The Guardian agreed that a lot of what the mother and father did was right but there was evidence from individual sources like the health visitor at Well Cared-For Children of their significant engagement with school and nursery, clean and tidy and not the kind of children that one would normally see from a chaotic household.  It would seem that there have been periods of time when their needs have been met.  The parents manage quite a lot of the time, to maintain routines, attendance at school and nursery and the children were not currently displaying emotional problems.  However, there had been times when the care had fallen short and been dangerous for the children.  New Year’s Eve and Day, the children were left uncared for for a long time.  On New Year’s day, they were not supervised and cared for and their needs were not met.  C could not get out of her cot.  B could get out of her bed and do who knows what.  In terms of basic physical and emotional needs, these were not met that day.  Also, their admissions of the parents found ongoing drug and alcohol use and reports of that impacting on the parenting ability of the parents.  </span></p>

About 17 hours had passed from when the father went to sleep until B got up.  Even for young children like that, it was a long time: 12 hours maybe but not 17 hours.  In addition, the father did not hear Mother take J out of the Moses basket.  It is very hard to know what was going on at this time because there is so much confusing information around timings.

She played pop music and made noises that could be heard from the bedrooms in the family home.  After 9.00am on New Year’s Day, V came to the family home.  He and R left by 10.00am.  The mother fell asleep after V and R left.  She did not offer any further care to any of the children, including J.  </span></p>

She was pregnant at the time.  The mother became aggressive with the father to the point that he needed to call the police.  The mother knew she was pregnant when she got drunk on 29 June 2022.  She had instructed her solicitor to inform the other parties of her pregnancy two days before the inquest on 27 June 2022.  The father was aware of that pregnancy before that date.</span></p>

There are, currently, no concerns about her health or development.  She is very settled with her paternal grandmother but does ask when she is going home.  She has a close bond with the grandmother and her Auntie BB, who lives with them.  She attends [redacted] where she is reported to be doing well.  C is four.  There were no concerns about her health or development.  She is also very settled in her placement with the paternal grandmother.  She has a close relationship with her and her Auntie BB.  She attends [redacted] where she is doing well.  Where possible, of course, the children should be brought up together with their mother and the father.  They have suffered inordinate loss and none of the Local Authority’s care plans will suffer further loss and grief.  All of this is rightly acknowledged by the Local Authority.  Both B and C have been exposed to parental drug use, the mother’s alcohol misuse and to domestic abuse.  Both girls enjoy regular family time with their parents; A and D, three times a week.  The girls both require permanence and stability in a warm, loving environment where they can be free from parental drug and alcohol misuse and domestic abuse.</span></p>

I am satisfied that each of the three children is settled in their current placement; A in his residential placement and B and C with their paternal grandmother.  If, as the mother suggests, A was to be placed with D in a foster placement, then he would need to move placement for what would be short period of time.  He would then leave the placement, leaving B alone there.  At present, there is no way of knowing how stable that placement would be.  I also accept the evidence of the social worker that it would be extremely difficult to find a placement for him at his age at that time.  </span></p>

He would, however, in my judgment, be at risk of suffering significant emotional and physical harm through drug and alcohol drug misuse by the mother, drug use by the father, consequential neglect and at risk of physical harm, for example, using some of the illicit drugs that are likely to be present in the home as they were on 1 January 2022.  When it was put to the mother that A could have reached drugs that were on the side of the cupboards, the mother made what was, a best, a naïve remark and, at worst, an utterly reprehensible remark that A would know, at his age, not to touch drugs.  This is in a household where drug use has become normalised.  Such a remark shows a complete lack of insight and a disregard for her child’s wellbeing.  If the three children remain in the current placements, they will continue to have ongoing contact with their birth mother and the girls with their birth father, G.</span></p>

In addition, in my judgment, they will have suffered periods of neglect as they did during the Christmas period into New Year 2021/2022.  They will have also suffered significant emotional harm during the morning of New Year’s Day 2022.  The police bodycam footage reveals a desperate scene surrounding the death of their sibling J.  The chaos caused by the visiting emergency services and exacerbated, in particular, by the mother’s intoxication with drugs and alcohol.  That, along with the fact that the mother had taken J from her cot and brought her downstairs caused an angry reaction from the father which would have added to the children’s overwhelming sense of anxiety and confusion and significant emotional harm.  Frankly, the children could not have failed to suffer significant emotional harm. </span></p>

There is no “One size fits all”.  Children will show the impacts of neglect in different ways and at different times.  However, what is clear, in my judgment, based, largely on the evidence that has come from the mouths of the parents themselves, is that they have each suffered significant emotional harm and long periods of neglect, albeit, at other times, they have enjoyed a good standard of parenting.  Should the children return to the care of the mother and the father, then, in my judgment, they will continue to be at risk of suffering significant physical and emotional harm.  The risk of the mother returning to a life of excessive drinking and drug misuse is too high, in my judgment.  Even the father, in custody, recognised the clear risk in paragraphs eight and nine of his statement dated 5 April 2023.  Based on the current evidence, I consider it likely that she will.  Even now, she has not abstained from alcohol and continues to drink socially albeit in moderation based on her own evidence.  </span></p>

The mother also tested positive for cannabis from mid-August 2021 to mid-February 2022 in the high range with the older segment at medium range thereafter.  She also tested positive for cannabis midMarch 2022 to mid-June 2022.  Her case is that she does not smoke cannabis as she cannot get on with it.  The father also said in his police interview that the mother does not use cannabis.  He repeated that in evidence.  However, I am satisfied, on the balance of probabilities that she has used cannabis.  Her case is that she has ingested cannabis by being in the close proximity of the father in the garden shed which is where he chose to smoke his cannabis.  Whether she is actively using cannabis or simply putting herself in a position where she is inhaling so much of the cannabis smoke of the father that she tested positive for its direct use and has metabolised it is not, in my judgment, as significant a difference as may be thought.  </span></p>

It is argued, on her behalf, that she has no reason to lie about her cannabis use as she accepts her use of cocaine and alcohol use.  I disagree.  The motive for lying about it is that the drug results reveal cannabis metabolites up to mid-November 2022.  That evidence to support a finding of drug use extends beyond her cessation of cocaine and chronic excessive alcohol use.  It is more recent.  Even if I am wrong in my finding that she has been actively using cannabis, she is still putting herself in a position where she is exposed to the harmful effects of that illicit drug.  In addition to that, I am also satisfied that she was and will be likely to continue to abuse prescription drugs illicitly obtained from friends as I find she was doing.  I do not believe that she got all those drugs from X to give to her mother.  They were also for her personal use.  </span></p>

The mother has shown a lack of self-awareness around her substance misuse problem.  She failed to recognise that alcohol was an issue during the initial parenting assessment.  The mother, in the witness box, 16 months after commencement of proceedings, admitted to her longstanding problems with alcohol misuse.  This is a step in the right direction.  However, in my judgment, it is too little, too late.  The mother has admitted to that in the face of overwhelming evidence.  In respect of other matters, however, she has continued to be dishonest where she thinks it might assist her case or escape criticism or blame.  She has lied to professionals and the Court previously to conceal the truth of her drug and alcohol abuse.  In my judgment, the Court can have little confidence that the mother would work openly and honestly with safeguarding professionals in the future so that they might manage risk.  In so finding, I have considered the full range of possible alternative reasons for her dishonesty.</span></p>

The mother has lied about the time when she last fed J and the time when she, herself, fell asleep.  I find that she slept from about 10.00am.  I attach weight to the police statements of Messrs V and R despite R’s poor performance in the witness box and V refusing to come to court, the absence of mobile phone use after 9.45am when contrasted with her use of the phone at other times, including through the night and early morning and the fact that she had been up all night drinking and taking drugs from about 10.00pm.

As the father suggested, she made up most of her statement.  This dishonesty was, in part, to help her cope with her own sense of grief but also to avoid professionals and the police detecting any culpability on her part, for neglect.  Having shown a basic level of insight and openness in his police interview and the first parenting assessment, accepted by the Local Authority, the father appeared to be motivated to change at the start of these proceedings.  He has not only failed to execute change around substance misuse, he has increased his use of cannabis and cocaine, used as a cocktail, despite them having an admitted negative impact on his parenting capability.  He was evasive when questioned about his illicit drug use, saying, “I am not an expert” and “I don’t know what you want me to say” when asked about the effects of cannabis on him.  </span></p>

The father has shown that he is unable to stand up to the mother.  He is not able to be positively protective and, instead, has shown a willingness to cover up issues.  The father’s response to the alpha and DNA legal test results for cocaine use is that he has been visiting pubs which are so crowded with active cocaine users that there is cocaine powder in the air that he has ingested.  He visits those pubs with the mother.  I am satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that the father has used cocaine, based on the expert evidence of DNA and W.

Substance misuse of the extensive type that has been admitted in this case comes with an inherently high risk of neglect, significant physical harm through access to illicit street prescription drugs and significant emotional harm.  The parents have admitted not only to the substance misuse, and, by extension, those risks but also the fact of significant harm to the children on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day.  The parents have admitted the children being exposed to the mother’s substance misuse by returning home intoxicated by drink or drugs, A, in particular, witnessing her being intoxicated and aggressive and her being incapacitated by being hungover after the event.  </span></p>

The Local Authority is concerned, however, of whether this can be sustained, taking into account that only this week has the mother managed to admit that she had a problem to address.  The fact, also, that she was around drugs several times a day, going to pubs where she is surrounded by alcohol and cocaine per G’s account, and remains disinclined to tell the full truth about anything that might cause concern amongst professionals are all extremely poor indicators for sustaining this progress.

They should have expected to be subject to scrutiny and investigation and to do otherwise was, in my judgment, to put their own needs first above those of the children.  I reject the suggestion that there was no evidence to support the Local Authority case that the children have suffered significant harm as a result of their parenting.  A has been demonstrating behavioural difficulties: a number of exclusions from school which have settled down in his current care regime.  Even the father describes behavioural difficulties in the home: C194, aggressive behaviour around the home which the father suggests requires anger management or therapy.  Those behaviours appear to have abated in care.  However, in any event, I draw the reasonable inference from the oral evidence given by the parents that the children would have suffered significant emotional harm from the drink and drug abuse of the parents and domestic abuse described by the father, which I accept.  In addition, they would be likely to be at risk of significant emotional and physical harm in the future.</span></p>

There are open adoptions, where the child sees his or her natural parents, but I think it would be fair to say that such arrangements tend not to be seen where the adoptive parents are not in full agreement.

The risk of relapse in terms of the mother’s drug and alcohol use, recognising that she accepts that she still drinks occasionally is simply too high.

I recognise that either a return to the parents for D or placement in long-term foster care would keep her birth family ties going and avoid a further sense of loss, particularly, for A, B and C and I accept that it will be hugely upsetting for them.
