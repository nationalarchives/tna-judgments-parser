He has some behavioural difficulties that are improving with careful adult reassurance and may also be due to his experiences in the family home. His emotional and developmental progress should be carefully monitored by the health visitor and social worker to ensure he does make the expected progress over the next few weeks and months and that he receives therapeutic input if needed [E55-E69, O334-O341, O361-O384]</p>

This is highly suggestive of non-accidental/inflicted injury. As per the RCPCH child protection companion chapter 9 “rib fractures in very young children are highly specific for abuse. Abusive rib fractures are commonly multiple. The commonest site for abusive rib fractures are posterior rib fractures”. [B’s] case was peer reviewed on [date]. Recommendations and follow up.  Following on from the strategy meetings held on [date], and [date] a section 47 investigation is ongoing. Medically B will be followed up by the Ophthalmology team under [name] in one years’ time to assess her visual development. We are awaiting a tertiary report of the second limited skeletal survey as there is a suggestion there may have been some subtle changes indicative of a fracture not seen on the initial survey.

On initial images there is a linear lucency paralleling the metaphyseal margin on AP view and fragmentation on the ventral aspect of the metaphysis on lateral projection. Both of these findings have resolved on the subsequent images and on the balance of probability I believe that the appearances here represent a metaphyseal fracture. There are healing fractures of the posterior aspects of the right sixth and 11th ribs and of the left fourth rib. On the images dated [date] there is focal callus formation in relation to all of these fractures. On the images dated [date] there has been some remodelling, but the fracture line is clearly visible in relation to the right 11th rib. There are equivocal appearances to the medial aspects of the distal femoral metaphases bilaterally. On the initial images there is subtle spurring evident. Allowing for slight projectional differences this has not altered significantly on the subsequent study dated [date] and on the balance of probability this is likely to represent physiological spurring.' There is an equivocal appearance to the right distal tibial metaphysis. on the initial AP images there is a suggestion of a double density medially with an intervening linear lucency' Unfortunately the projection obtained on follow up views is significantly different, making it difficult to assess whether this represents a normal physiological finding or a bucket handle fracture”.</p>

The schedule was expanded following the conclusion of the evidence and all parties have responded. In final submissions the local authority submits that the evidence does not enable the court to identify the perpetrator of the injuries to B. In those circumstances the court should arrive at a list of potential perpetrators i.e persons in respect of whom there is a real possibility that they caused the injuries and that the said list comprises of two people namely the mother and the father.   In the event that the findings are made, then it seeks for the children to continue to be placed with the maternal grandmother and aunt under interim care orders pending a trial placement followed by Special Guardianship Orders.</p>

The magnitude of this assertion and the extent to which the local authority and the Children’s Guardian make a similar assertion will be dealt with later in this judgment. The mother is clear in the submissions from her leading and junior counsel, and from her stated position upon the resumption of the fact finding hearing that the father has lied about his mental well-being, he has done so with a view to avoiding giving evidence and that the reason that he did not wish to give evidence was that he has caused the injuries to B.</p>

For a period during the proceedings, he was subject to a negative capacity assessment and was represented by the Official Solicitor. Following a second report, the court being dissatisfied with a report from Dr McClintock for reasons set out in my judgment on 24 October 2023 which is at S485 he has resumed a full role in the proceedings and has instructed leading and junior counsel through his solicitor and with the benefit of an intermediary. His position is that the court should find that the mother has caused the injuries but it is accepted that the court might not feel able to do so in which case the correct approach is to make a finding as to those in respect of whom there is a real possibility that they caused the injuries and it is accepted that he would be on that list along with the mother.</p>

One of the few advantages of the proceedings having taken so many months is that the local authority had the opportunity to reflect upon having heard all of its own evidence and that of the maternal grandmother, which enabled it to conclude at that stage that it would no longer seek a finding against the grandmother. All parties agreed and she was removed from the schedule of findings. She has remained as a party however given that the local authority’s plan is for the children to be placed with her and indeed they have been placed with her during the latter part of the proceedings. The grandmother's evidence contributed to the factual matrix. Her evidence is relevant  as to what she has seen and also the relationship in the family in the wider context. At the conclusion of the fact find hearing she has made detailed submissions through her counsel as to the likely perpetrator and seeks to persuade the court that the father is the perpetrator. Ultimately, she seeks care of the children jointly with the aunt. </p>

In A, B and C (Children) [2021] EWCA Civ 451. Macur LJ at para 58 states. “That a tribunal’s Lucas self-direction is formulaic, and incomplete is unlikely to determine an appeal, but the danger lies in its potential to distract from the proper application of its principles. In these circumstances, I venture to suggest that it would be good practice when the tribunal is invited to proceed on the basis , or itself determines, that such a direction is called for, to seek Counsel’s submissions to identify: (i) the deliberate lie(s) upon which they seek to rely; (ii) the significant issue to which it/they relate(s), and (iii) on what basis it can be determined that the only explanation for the lie(s) is guilt. The principles of the direction will remain the same, but they must be tailored to the facts and circumstances of the witness before the court”.

Further it is impossible to say where the hands which caused the injuries were positioned as the fracture can occur away from that point. If the injuries were caused by a squeeze, they would not necessarily be at the site where the fingers were placed. He accepted that if a person were to pick up the child face to face and apply the necessary pressure to cause the injury, more pressure being applied on one side could lead to there being two breaks on that side but he responded that it would also depend on how the child was being held and how the force was distributed through the rib. He also stated that it was not possible to say that it was more likely that the person who inflicted the injury was left or right handed – there were too many variables at play.</p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in">Fractures are extremely painful, both when the fractures occur but also during normal handling and movements by the child EG when getting dressed. Pain from fractures occurs not only from the episode but also from movement of the broken areas against each other. With fractures of the limbs, immobilisation of the limb through a cast is often enough to reduce any painful sensation, however, neither rib fractures nor skull fractures can be immobilised to reduce pain. Normal breathing movements will be painful with rib fractures and so infants will often start to breathe shallowly to avoid causing too much pain. Parents may or may not notice that the infant is not breathing as deeply as before. Handling around the chest when lifting, dressing etc will be painful and infants with rib fractures will be distressed during this handling unless there is something else compromising their responses. Once the rib fractures are healed sufficiently for there to be little movement or disturbance of the bone then breathing will become less painful the time this takes is variable from child to child and cannot be quantified.</p>

The additional questions went specifically, to how B may have presented upon suffering the rib fractures and in the hours following the injuries. The expert responded as follows: “as each child is an individual it is not possible to be specific. As discussed in my first report fractures are painful when they occur, and I would expect a child to cry out and be distressed... Each child is an individual and they show their distress in many ways from facial grimacing, crying, screaming, wriggling, refusing feeds etc. Many parents identify and learn their child's cues and begin to distinguish a hungry cry from a pain cry but not all parents can do this. If a child was otherwise normally a settled or quiet baby, then I would expect that any signs of distress would have been noted as unusual or a change in behaviour and that a parent or carer would have therefore realised that something was wrong, but they may not have realised that this specifically meant pain.... It is not possible to state how B might have specifically presented... I described the general features of rib fractures i.e that a child may breathe more shallowly or be distressed when being handled. This might take the form of B crying each time she was being handled or be more fussy or unsettled. It is not possible to say how long this might last for.” In response to the question as to how B may have shown her distress and how obvious that would have been to a carer that she was suffering pain upon handling they response was “as outlined above this is difficult to say and there are many ways for better show that they are in distress which include crying, being unsettled, grimacing. Parents may have notice she was more distressed or unsettled when being handled particularly she was normally a settled Placid baby, but this may not have realised this specifically meant she was in pain. The expert was taken to the mother statement at C158 was she noted B to be distressed. In that statement at paragraphs 27 to 29 the mother describes an unwitnessed episode of the father feeding B when she heard B crying more than usual and for longer. She then took over feeding B who settled and calmed. The expert comments “it is possible that the excessive crying noted by the mother represented an injury being caused but it could also be that the injury have previously been caused and B was crying because she was in pain from being handled or that no injury was being caused or are being caused and B was distressed for another reason.”</p>

She considered that the description of small dots was a reasonable way of expressing what was seen.</p>

Sch will generally resolve in days, and one would not expect them to endure beyond two weeks. One would not expect the sch to go away and then come back. She agreed with Dr Markham that the fact that the sch were bilateral is significant and not surprising as they occur due to an increase in pressure and both eyes are in the same head.</p>

The person who caused the injury would know they had caused it as B would be distressed. The child would subsequently be more grizzly. A person who was not there at the time might notice a change in behaviour. They might not seek immediate medical attention but would bring it up with the health visitor. A parent noticing a few red dots in the eye might not be expected to have an immediate response in terms of seeking medical help but would contact 111 or go to A&amp;E or speak to the health visitor if there were blood over a large proportion of the eye the next day.</p>

This might be the only thing that apparent, a carer would pick up; that change of behaviour and I think I've already said that actually it's really difficult for professionals, particularly when we don't know the babies too, and when we clinically examine them, to be able to identify that there are rib fractures there.”</p>

The existence of the rib fractures and the expert evidence as to causation is not disputed. The parties make different submissions as to the most likely timing of the rib fractures in the light of the totality of the evidence which will be addressed below. There are two schools of thought. The first is that advanced by the children's guardian that the court should accept the evidence of Dr Johnson which was subject to a caveat to the extent made clear by him in terms of the difficulty in dating fractures, but was clear in that he dated the rib fractures as being at least two weeks old at the time of the first X-ray. This conclusion is reached in the light of the extent of the healing presentation at that point and the subsequent healing process which was evidenced by the second set of X-rays 11 days later. The doctors involved in the taking and initial review of the X-rays on the 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September reached a similar conclusion. The second school of thought entertained by all others is that the caveat attached to Dr Johnson's evidence enables the court to conclude, in the light of the totality of the evidence, that although there was the degree of healing seen by Dr Johnson on the X-ray of 1<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">st</span> September, in fact, the ribs were injured closer to the date of the X-rays and (the parties differ as to the exact date of causation) were more likely to have been inflicted on the morning of the 26<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August or thereafter.</p>

The first being that put by the children's guardian which is to remind the court of the description of burst blood vessels advanced by the maternal grandmother and aunt as having been seen by them on 18<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August. If the court accepts the description from those witnesses as being true and accurate then one has a description which has been accepted by Dr Markham as being appropriate, present in the child at a time which fits with Dr Johnson's ageing of the rib fractures. That said, the court has in mind the caution expressed by Dr Cleghorn in the context of whatever those members of the family reported not having been seen by a professional. Without at this stage delving into the factual matrix, search haemorrhages were not seen by medical professionals either on the 16<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> or 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August.</p>

The three areas of evidence are as follows: family life before the issue of proceedings (including the parents relationship on the involvement of children services); the events at the [train station]; the subject of father's capacity and whether he has sought to mislead the parties and the court as to his mental well-being and ability to participate in the court process.</p>

She was unable to reconcile the text messages with the mother which suggested more contact with the mother and B than the witness was willing to admit. This included one occasion when the whole family was said to be together at the grandmother’s house for a roast dinner, but the grandmother was steadfast that this had never happened. The grandmother’s evidence was at odds with the interpretation of the text chain which I am invited by the mother to adopt. That text chain is more consistent with the events as advanced by the mother than it is with that advanced by the grandmother. The suggestion is that this grandmother has prevented the court process and those involved having the greatest knowledge of B’s movements must have some weight in my deliberations.   I note that there has been no evidence given by the mother of any cause for concern regarding B’s health either at the alleged roast dinner or the alleged later visit to Wetherspoons. The cross examination of this witness by counsel for the mother was patient and thorough and revealed what I am satisfied was a determination by the paternal grandmother to answer only the questions she wished to answer and not to enter into a productive discourse. Her answers to questions were rarely fully on point. They were slightly but significantly shifted in terms of their response. The result was that it would have been easy to have missed that the question had not been in fact answered. The tenacity of Miss Minoprio enabled the court to appreciate that this technique was being deployed and to realise how dominant it was during the lengthy exchange so as to be incapable of being explained by confusion or nerves.</p>

It is also clear that the grandmother was very much involved in the life of C and that any concerns which she might have had with either the father or C’s mother and which arose from the delay in declaring to the grandmother that she had a grandchild, were long buried.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I heard from [name] who is the biological mother of the father's child C. They assisted the court with gaining an understanding of the father's relationship with C. I was told that there was no romantic relationship between them. The father has spent time with C which, during his relationship with the mother has involved C staying with the mother and father for several days per week. This was the arrangement prior to B’s birth and after B’s birth though the contact seems to have been less, there were occasions when all three children were in the care of the parents. The witness confirmed the delay in informing the paternal grandparents of C’s existence / status. When asked why the father would have told others that he was not the father the witness came up with the completely unconvincing response that it was appropriate for the father to deny being the father of C because he was always referred to as “daddy”. In my judgment that answer illustrated the skewed thinking of this witness on this particular issue. </p>

The nature of the contact included messages which though not personally sexual related to sexual content. When questioned about the appropriateness of these messages the witness responded that as they are asexual they meant nothing to them. As was obvious from the response of the father in court who giggled at this point, it was clear that they did have a titillating content so far as he was concerned.</p>

They claimed to be unable to remember with whom they had had discussions. At the end of the witness’s evidence, they admitted to having recorded the entirety of their evidence on a phone. They denied that they had been put up to this by anyone else and claimed that they record all conversations so as to be able to recall what was said later given difficulties with their memory. I do not accept that there was any reason at all for this witness to record the evidence as they have no reason to wish to be reminded of its content away from these proceedings. Accordingly, I am driven to the conclusion that there was a malevolent reason for the recording having been conducted and I note the witness’s continued involvement with the father's family.</p>

The hiding of his paternity is a feature of the early days of the relationship between himself and the mother. The detail of the lies in relation to first saying that the father of C was dead then saying that the father wished to adopt C all go to the ability of the father and those around him to lie as and when it suits them.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the question of her relationship with the daughter, she felt that her daughter had pulled away from her since being with the father. Sometimes she would not hear from her for five days and when prompted the mother would say that she had been busy. She felt that the mother was going towards the father’s family, and she therefore decided to take a step back and let the mother find her own way. This started pretty much straight away after the relationship between the parents commenced. She was concerned about a lack of honesty around the relationship and confirmed that she had him a bad feeling about the father from the moment she met him and his family. She referred to the issue around C’s paternity and she said “I don't like liars.” She said that she would have much preferred to have been told the truth from the start but “I can't deal with people who lie to me.” She confirmed that the mother had lied to her as well and it seemed that the mother’s motivation was not having seen a DNA test at that point. There had been a falling out when the truth about C had been discovered. There have been occasions when the mother has lied to the grandmother, and she confirmed that when she was younger, the mother had a temper. That said, she has calmed down since she had children. She did not think that the mother struggled to look after the children. The mother used to take the children out quite a lot whereas the father did not want to. She said that the mother is the sort of person that would never admit she was struggling but after hearing all of the evidence it was quite obvious to the grandmother that she had been struggling, and the grandmother said she wished that the mother had asked for more help. Later in her evidence she was taken to more recent behaviour which showed the mother to have lost her temper.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">From the grandmother’s evidence the court has the picture of her relationship with the mother deteriorating following the mother forming a relationship with the father. She felt pushed out by the paternal family. She was clear that the mother had a temper when she was younger, and she also answered questions about exchanges between the two more recently. She did not know of the extent of the problems the mother was facing in terms of looking after the children and she wished that the mother had asked for more help. This witness came across as having a realistic view of her daughter, she was in no way claiming her daughter is perfect. She was clear about what she had seen in terms of B and she was clear about what she had felt about the relationship between the parents. She was honest and making it clear that much of her view of the father arose from her initial instinct, but she was also clear that the lies and his behaviour subsequently  did nothing to improve her view of him. I note her contribution to this aspect of the evidence and treat it with caution not because the witness has been dishonest but because she has been honest about this subjectivity upon which her views of the father are in part based.</p>

The children's guardian provided a case report on that day setting out events which had occurred on Friday 28<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July after court. That document is at C676. Miss Jones the author was not required for cross examination at the recent hearing. I am satisfied that the account within it is accurate, and I find that events occurred on that day as she has described. In short at 17.44 she received a phone call from the father whom she described as being emotional and distressed and who told her that he had seen the mother at the train station and that she had come to speak to him about the children's futures. He was worried and panicked that they had spoken and repeatedly said that he had broken the rules. He had told the guardian that the mother had not been upset but he was worried that she might say something different at court. He indicated that he had already spoken to his intermediary about what had happened and that he was trying to speak to the local authority. The guardian told him that she would let the children's barrister know so that others could be made aware, and he said that he was worried about this being held against him when giving his evidence. He called again at 18.10 in what the guardian describes as a more distressed state including being breathless. He told the guardian that he had lied to her and that it was he who had gone to speak to the mother.  He spoke of being a liar and how everyone will know that he lied. The guardian was worried that he was having a panic attack and so worried that she contacted his mother after he had agreed to that happening and sending her his mother's mobile number subsequently at 18.48 the guardian was in touch with the paternal grandmother who indicated that she was with the father and was going to take him to hospital.</p>

Those representing the mother made application to the court for the father’s telephone records on the basis that there was a concern that those being asked to give a view about the father's level of functioning were not being given an accurate picture by him. The litigation process around this issue is covered in my judgement of the 24<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> October 2023 and I do not intend to go into any detail at this stage. Suffice to say that ultimately the telephone records did provide a picture of life which showed that the picture given to those commenting upon the father's functioning was not comprehensive. Dr McClintock had been assisting the court as to the father's capacity. My dissatisfaction with the approach taken by that expert and the court’s lack of confidence in his conclusion led to there being a second psychiatrist instructed namely Dr Morton. Dr Morton found that the father did have capacity and it was confirmed in the run up to this hearing that the father continues to have capacity. The reports of Dr Morton bear reading in full so that the subtlety of his approach is not lost.</p>

There are numerous examples in the text messages of the father’s phone that contradict his assertion to Dr McClintock that he was not engaging in any activities during the day and that he ‘will do nothing, I stay in, there’s nothing for me to do.’ [E271 §4.6] He was taken to many examples by Professor Delahunty KC in her cross examination, highlighting his repeated social activities with his five-aside football team and his involvement in proactively organising some of those events; his holiday [abroad] with his parents; his engagement with strangers on the dating app Tinder; his interaction with a neighbour and the care of his grandmother. The Guardian shares the concerns of the other parties in this respect and does consider that the evidence suggests that the father’s assertions about his daily activities to Dr McClintock were untrue.</span></p>

Overall, the Guardian would urge the Court to exercise caution in accepting at face value when the father says that he cannot remember and would flag up the following points for particular consideration:</span></p>

The quote is that the father is worried that 'if he was doing more the court would feel that he was better and expect him to give evidence'. The Court may consider that this is an indication that the father had formed an understanding in his own mind (and one that he was prepared to articulate to a professional) that he would be less likely to be required to give evidence if his health was considered to be poor and therefore, he recognised that his exposure to cross examination is directly linked to whether or not he is perceived to be ‘better’. Having made that link, if the father wished to avoid giving evidence, he would have the incentive to continue to present himself as not being ‘better’ thus maintaining his assertion that he has lost his memory.</span></p>

If the scars that he is pointing to are those relating to the injuries observed by Dr McClintock when he assessed the father on 2 October 2023, it would seem that ‘new [father’s name]’ emerged in the Autumn of 2023. The order for the inspection of [the fahter’s] mobile phone was made on 5 October 2023, but he was on notice of such an application being made from 13 September 2023 [B274] so his self-harming behaviour may be linked to that knowledge. </span></p>

Within that, the Court will have to consider if the invasion of his privacy of itself (at that point likely to be heavily redacted although later reversed to open disclosure) was a trigger to self-harm or whether it was the consequential impact on [the father’s] credibility that was the driving force. The Court may conclude that it is impossible to separate out the various influences, but the Guardian does think it is important that all options are considered given the significance of these events.</span></p>

It was also noticeable that [the father] seemed to revert to the use of the third person when describing the behaviour of ‘old [father’s name]’ in what seemed to be a further attempt to distance himself from more difficult questions put to him by Counsel. </span></p>

I am particularly struck by the evidence from Dr Morton regarding the father's ability to have a clear recollection of events which he had previously said that he could not remember (as set out at paragraph 2A of the guardian submissions). This ability to recall sits alongside the ability to recall as evidenced by the examples identified in the mother submissions where the father was able to recall notwithstanding his claim to have lost his memory.

On the question as to the father's credibility and his memory loss and whether the same is genuine, the court is reminded of the conclusions of Dr McClintock on two occasions regarding the father lacking capacity and that Dr Morton reached a contra review but nevertheless said that it was a borderline decision. It is submitted that the court should accept the expert evidence supported by the various medical records exhibited by the father to his six statement and conclude that the father had a genuine breakdown in July / August 2023. The father argues that if the court accepts that he had a breakdown then that goes a long way to counter the assertions the mother has made about his credibility and therefore in simple terms it is contended that the meltdown was genuine.</p>

It is more likely than not that he was then worried about the consequences of his behaviour that day and his lying to the guardian. We know that he was worried because he said so to the guardian. It is likely that his worry about giving evidence would be increased in the light of what he had just done. That said, he had the benefit of a known and familiar legal team around him and a very supportive, familiar and engaged intermediary.</p>

He claimed to be suffering mentally and described various aspects of his life to those whose help he was seeking. It has become apparent that he did not give them the full picture as do what was happening in his life and this continued when he saw Dr McClintock who was to assist the court on the very subject as to whether the father was fit to give evidence. The inaccuracies in his account to the professionals have been laid bare by telephone records and investigations into his daily life, his international travel, and his social and personal life. Given that he has continued to live a life involving his friends, playing football, going on holiday, and not being at his mother’s as claimed, one can see that the purpose of speaking to medical professionals as he did, was not so as to seek some change to or advice about his daily life. The only area in which there has been a significant consequence of his claim to be unwell has been in the court arena and in the related context of his then not seeing his children. </p>

He lied to the mother at the outset and failed to be open with his own parents. The deception went beyond a straight denial to a concoction regarding the death of the child's father and an application by this father to adopt. That said, it is correct that this dishonesty is in a different category to that above in that it has less direct relevance and has thus limited my ability to satisfy the approach now taken in respect of the Lucas test which has been applied carefully in the analysis on behalf of the mother above and which I adopt. I do accept however that this is dishonesty which goes to the father's credibility in that it was perpetuated in his dealings with social services and is indicative of his ability willingness and to obfuscate so as not to answer difficult questions.</p>

Thus, we have evidence from the grandmother that as early as the 17<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August the mother was communicating to others about her worries about B’s eyes.

There is a text message to the father at 08.27 where she mentions having bought breakfast. The evidence is that the children were left at home with the father during that excursion. The mother was unable to provide the court with any further detail about what happened immediately upon her return home that morning and what discussions took place with the father.

I have in mind the questions about the daily evolution of the redness of the eyes. I was alert to the mother’s presentation during that evidence and had I been concerned that fairness was not being achieved then I would have stopped the questions. In the end, I am satisfied that what occurred was that the mother was given the best possible opportunity to communicate to the court the extent of her concerns about B’s eyes and how that concern was maintained.</p>

He spoke of the “Old [father’s name]” and the “New [father’s name]” to which I have referred previously. Anything that was to do with the older [father’s name] he claimed to forget except as per the examples which I have already cited above, and he now claims that the New [father’s name] would behave differently. His position is that the New [father’s name] cannot comment upon what happened in the world of the Old [father’s name] and so it follows that his contribution to the evidence of the events around B’s injuries is limited to that which he has already written as opposed to being able to elaborate further or assist the court further during his evidence before me in the hearing.</p>

Her evidence is clear that she was desperate to have the father involved more. She tried to involve him more by persuading him to spend time with B and she resorted to sending text messages to him as if they were from B. Her evidence is that none of this succeeded and that the father was distant and at times, when interacting with B, she was concerned. It is clear however that her concerns were not such as to lead her to make complaint to anyone else or to remove herself and her children from the home. There is no indication that her concerns reached anything like that level and one notes that at no time whatsoever, before the father's alleged mental breakdown, did she advance a positive case against the father. Of course, it is not for her to prosecute the father, but it is her responsibility to make sure that the court has all the information which she has available to her when making decisions about B’s future and when trying to work out what has happened to her in the past.</p>

Even the delay between sending the text on the 29<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August and waiting for the health visitor to visit on the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August is in my judgement an unacceptable delay and not one which could be expected of a reasonable parent in circumstances where this young child had shown varying symptoms of illness in the eyes over a number of weeks and which we know to have escalated in the immediate run up to the admission to hospital on 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> August.</p>

I am satisfied that she did not cause the injury and that it is more likely to have occurred when the father had sole care of the child, even in the context of that being for minutes and perhaps in a different room of the house to the mother. The evidence from the paediatrician regarding the infinite variation in terms of pain and how a child exhibits the same, combined with none of the visiting health professionals noting any discomfort on the child being handled, leads me to the conclusion that the mother if absent at the time that the injury was caused, would not be aware of it and therefore could not be said to be culpable for failing to protect the child going forward</p>

Something caused her to make that search. However, she then remained in the family home until the 30<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> and in that continued to expose B to the environment in which she had come to experience damage to her eyes. The mother’s inability to provide me with an account as to what happened that morning leaves the court to conclude that the mother was concerned as to the origins of the condition of B’s eyes and failed to remove her from environment within which B’s eyes had suffered. She has provided the court with an account of the father's behaviour which has contributed to the courts thinking in terms of the conclusions to be drawn about his harming B. The mother had much of that information all along and was equipped to reach a similar conclusion.</p>

The injuries inflicted are in my judgment injuries to which a young baby is susceptible and are not injuries to which similar handling of A would make him susceptible. In addition, the circumstances around handling a tiny baby are very different from those around the handling of an older child. I am not satisfied that A was likely to suffer significant harm but I am satisfied that he was likely to suffer emotional harm as a result of his little sister being injured and also the dynamics at large in the family home at that time.</p>

Whilst I have already noted that the conditions at the time that B was admitted to hospital was satisfactory there is sufficient evidence in the chronology and in the references  relied upon by the local authority to form a  firm conclusion that there were times during A’s life when the local authority’s concerns regarding home conditions were manifest. I have considered the references cited at paragraph 13 on mother's evidence about home conditions including her acceptance that at times they had been dirty. Even without that acceptance, having regard to the totality of the evidence I make the finding sought by the local authority. There had been sufficient occurrences in the history to enable this court to consider it likely that the waxing and waning of conditions which had been manifest in the past is likely to reoccur with consequent effect for B.</p>
