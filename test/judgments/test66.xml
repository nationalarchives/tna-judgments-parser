We also note that the Appellant has been registered for VAT since April 2010. In our view, he should have been aware of his VAT obligations, e.g. to file VAT returns on time and to make payment on time. Compliance with those obligations are not contingent on him having received reminders to do so, or notices of surcharge.</p>

The surcharges were correctly issued; the rates are prescribed by the statute. </p>
