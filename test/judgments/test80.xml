            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">On 20-21 February 2024 I heard the application by the defendant, Elster Water Metering Limited (“Elster”), for strike-out and/or summary judgment against the claimant, South East Water Limited (“SEW”), on its claim.  This is my judgment on that application.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In summary, SEW sues Elster to recover its claimed losses consequential upon the failure of automated meter reading (“AMR”) electronic units (also referred to as remote read radio modules) supplied by Elster to SEW pursuant to a framework agreement entered into in 2010, which made provision for the supply of water meters and AMR units.  The framework agreement had a 5 year term, which was subsequently extended by a further 5 years.  The AMR units were designed to allow water companies such as SEW remote access to the water meters which measure the amount of water supplied to individual properties within their region, facilitating meter reading for billing and other purposes.  Remote access reduces the time and cost of having to gain physical access to each meter, typically located underground, on what is a six monthly basis.  A substantial number of water meters and AMR units (some separate and some as part of a composite unit with the meters) were supplied over the lifetime of the framework agreement.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The essence of SEW’s case is that the AMR units were supplied with sealed in battery units which ought to have, but did not, in breach of contract, have a life of at least 10 years, comparable with the life expectancy of the water meters supplied by Elster.   Accordingly, complains SEW, it will need to replace all of the water meters and AMR units supplied under the framework agreement and, as a result, has incurred and will continue to incur substantial direct and other related losses.  SEW’s alleged losses are said to be very substantial, pleaded at between £19 million and £29 million, but it acknowledges that its overall recovery is subject to a contractual cap of £10 million.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Elster’s strike-out / summary judgment application, put briefly, is advanced on the principal basis that SEW’s claims cannot succeed because of two contractual provisions which, on Elster’s case, have the effect of: (a) preventing SEW from recovering anything more than the modest individual cost which Elster would incur in providing replacement AMR units and a specified contribution towards the replacement installation cost; and (b) excluding losses falling within specified categories of irrecoverable loss.  Elster raises other arguments, addressed below, but they are subsidiary to this principal argument.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">SEW’s primary submission is that the court should decline to entertain these arguments, because they cannot be resolved without an investigation into relevant disputed facts which, it says, cannot properly be performed at this summary stage.  Its secondary submission is that if the arguments are entertained then the court, proceeding - as it must - on the basis that SEW will make out its factual case at trial, should be satisfied that SEW’s case satisfies the modest requirement that it has a reasonably arguable prospect of success.</p>

It follows, in my judgment, that the paragraphs in the current Particulars of Claim which plead its particulars of loss and damage and its sums claimed under contractual indemnities (paragraphs 32 and 34) must be struck out and SEW must – assuming it wishes to do so - produce within a specified time any draft amended particulars of loss and damage which do not offend against the contractual provisions relied upon by Elster and which, if properly arguable and subject to any relevant considerations affecting the discretion to permit such amendments, may proceed to trial.</p>

This was the subject of a specific objection based on the well-estimated legal principle that a party cannot rely on statements made in pre-contract negotiations as part of the factual matrix.  However, as Mr Darton KC clarified in his oral submissions, the statements are not relied upon as relevant to the construction of the contract, but as to: (a) what was known to both parties pre-contract, which is relevant to explain the commercial and business object of the contract and also to the factual investigation which underpins any consideration as to whether or not the contractual limitation provision relied upon by Elster is reasonable under UCTA; and (b) the scope of Elster’s obligations to supply AMR units which were of satisfactory quality and reasonably fit for their intended purpose.   On that basis I am satisfied that – at least for the purposes of this application – the statements are admissible.</p>

After this, in 2015 SEW exercised its option to extend the framework agreement for a further 5 years on the terms of a supplemental deed which included the terms of the existing framework agreement and also made provision for a project to be undertaken to identify and replace further AMR units and meters where found defective.  Little, if anything, has been said in evidence about this project, but it is apparent that SEW considers that it was not fully effective to remedy the problems which it says it has continued to experience.</p>

It pleads that in the circumstances Elster has breached its express and/or implied obligations by reason of the failures of the AMR units within a period far shorter than the minimum 10 year life which SEW was entitled to expect and the projected similar failure rate of those already supplied and still operational.</p>

Elster complains that this limitation is not carried through into the claim in the prayer for relief, which is plainly true and which should, thus, be amended in the amended Particulars of Claim to be provided by SEW following this judgment and consequential order.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">In the light of the issues raised I need to begin by referring in a little detail to the genesis of the framework agreement.  It is common ground that it came into being as a result of a procurement exercise conducted by SEW which was commenced in autumn 2009 by way of a formal invitation to tender document (entitled “SEW ITT 002 Supply of Meters (AMR)”).  This made clear that it was a competitive public procurement exercise, to be carried out under the EU Procurement Directive as applicable to water utilities, using the negotiated procedure.  The invitation to tender was dated October 2009 and provided a timetable for the tender exercise with a view to the contract commencing on 1/5/10.  It included a draft framework agreement and required tenderers either to confirm acceptance of the terms or “list … your proposed amendments / variation”, which SEW would then consider as part of the overall tender assessment.  </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0in">It also permitted tenderers to submit requests for clarification and to provide compliant tender submissions but also variant tender submissions if they wished.  In relation to any variant submissions tendered SEW stated that they would be evaluated,  “providing they demonstrate a clear commercial or technical advantage” to SEW. It also stated that the AMR units “must allow for a minimum 10 year battery life” and, under Appendix 11, required (at paragraph 11.9) tenderers to provide details of battery life with supporting data.</p>

It is obvious in my judgment from the timeline of the award – as appears from the award letter (see below) - as well as the subject matter of the tenders, which was different, that the later version related to a different – albeit similar – product.  Nothing however of key significance turns on this point.</p>

It now appears from Mr Simko’s first witness statement that Elster did not in fact manufacture the AMR units.  This has caused SEW some disquiet, although Elster has contended that it made SEW aware that this was the case in subsequent correspondence.  As I indicated at the hearing, insofar as this is a relevant fact – which I doubt - I will assume it in SEW’s favour for present purposes.  The response also, in reply to paragraph 11.9, stated its “minimum battery life specifications” for its 2 existing products as being 12 years and 15 years respectively.  </p>

Having provided its responses to those requests the letter also included two further “clarifications”.  The first was a confirmed price reduction for a specific product and the second, headed “warranty and fault attribution”, contained the details of what Elster was proposing by way of warranty proposal.  This proposal subsequently became Sched. 11 to the framework agreement, so I shall refer to it in more detail below.  However, it is worth observing that there are four material differences between this proposal and what became Sched. 11: </p>

He does not suggest that this understanding was also communicated to him or anyone else at SEW as being a shared understanding by Elster.  Instead, what he says is that he does not recall any negotiation in relation to the Sched. 11 warranty; he says: “I believe that Elster offered the warranty in Schedule 11 to make its tender more attractive and SEW ultimately decided to award the contract to Elster (which would have involved taking into account many factors including the price and the fact that Elster was willing to offer replacements on the terms in Schedule 11)”.  He confirms his belief that there was “no negotiation of Schedule 11 after it was offered by Elster”.</p>

In short, apart from his suggestion that there must have been “some additional negotiation of Sched. 11 beyond what was initially proposed on 17 March 2010” he can add nothing.  </p>

Beyond that, however, there is no positive evidence about the fact or nature of any actual negotiation.  Since it is clear from Mr Moores’ evidence that his belief, confirmed by his review of the documentary evidence, is that there was no such negotiation, I must proceed for present purposes on that basis, which is the most favourable to SEW.  Also, no-one has suggested any explanation for the reference in the 17/3/10 letter to the statement “below conditions already stated in the original commercial response - warranty in respect of Goods &amp; Services and Defects Liability”.  Again, therefore, in the light of Mr Moores’ evidence that he believes that there was no previous reference in the “commercial response”, whatever that might have been and whether it even related to this tender, I must proceed for present purposes on that basis.</p>

In this paragraph it did not plead a positive case that Sched. 11 comprised Elster’s written standard terms of business.  It did, however, in paragraph 8 of its Reply, in the context of reliance on the <span style="font-style:italic">contra proferentum</span> rule of construction, plead that “the Framework Agreement was prepared by the Defendant and incorporated its standard terms and conditions”.  As Mr Power observed in his submissions, it is surprising – to say the least – that SEW could ever have pleaded this as a positive case, given the clear and overwhelming evidence (see above) that it was SEW which produced the framework agreement as part of the invitation to tender.  As he says, this pleaded allegation must also be struck out from the amended Particulars of Claim to be provided following this judgment.</p>

This, I must say, is neither as full nor as unreserved an admission as it should have been.  It is not simply a question of it <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">appearing</span> that he was mistaken – he plainly <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">was</span> mistaken and he ought to have said so in clear terms.  It also fails to provide any explanation as to how he came to allow the Reply to be filed and served in that form, with his statement of truth attached, with such an obvious error in it.  It does not appear that he could have conducted the enquiries, or ensured that such enquiries, obviously relevant to this issue, which needed to be made at the time were conducted.  It is not as if SEW had not already had plentiful time and opportunity to make these enquiries before it came to prepare its Reply.</p>

Again, it seems to me to be obviously necessary that this would have to be done, and his reluctance to accept this in clear terms is less than impressive, but of more importance to the current application is the basis for SEW’s stated corporate belief – whatever is meant by that expression. </p>

He then continues: “Mr Simko has not provided any documentary evidence for his assertion that Schedule 11 was “bespoke” (and he has no personal direct knowledge of how Schedule 11 was produced).  As such, there remains an important (and disputed) live issue of fact as to whether or not Schedule 11 (or even just the relevant provisions within Schedule 11) constituted Elster’s standard terms of business”.  </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The highest he gets to giving reasons for why this is a disputed issue is in paragraph 45 of his witness statement, where he says: “So far as I and indeed the senior management at SEW understand it, Elster has sold a lot of AMR water meters to other water companies/utilities both in the UK and in the US.  It was and is a substantial business within this field and, as such, is likely to have prepared its own draft terms for the purposes of this business and particularly in relation to the replacement of “faulty” units where it would be carrying out the necessary work and would have a greater understanding of the process involved and its costs”.  </p>

He does not even identify the senior management to whom he refers or the other water companies or utilities in the UK or US to which he refers.  Nor does he give any grounds for asserting that it is likely to have prepared its own draft terms, either generally or specifically in relation to the replacement of faulty units.  However, it is this apparent belief – and only this apparent belief - which forms the foundation for his submission at paragraph 46 that “a proper search must be carried out for similar (alleged) exclusion provisions in other contemporaneous contracts entered into by Elster and a disclosure statement must be given by a suitably authorised person from Elster setting out the extent of the search and confirming that disclosure has been given of relevant documents”.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Mr Poncia made this witness statement having already seen Mr Simko’s first witness statement in which Mr Simko had said, at paragraph 19, that he had “been provided with and reviewed some other comparable contracts which Elster entered into with other customers.  Those contracts contain different warranty provisions, and none of them contains a schedule which closely resembles Schedule 11 of the Framework Agreement”.  At paragraph 20 he said that he had “also not located any Elster standard terms and conditions which contain provisions similar to Schedule 11”.  He accepted that in other contracts he had reviewed “Elster was seeking to put in place a warranty regime that provided protection for it in line with expectations around how products would perform over time”.  He gave reasons in paragraph 23 for stating that the terms of Sched. 11 appeared to be “bespoke”, because “the product replacement regime based on the year of failure is specific and tied to the particular products supplied under the Framework Agreement (i.e., the AMR modules and the meters)”.  Mr Poncia did not engage in any way with this evidence in his witness statement.</p>

From my review of these agreements what they indicate, as indeed might be expected in contracts made with water supply companies, is that: (a) they appear to be based on the individual water suppliers’ own particular standard terms; and (b) there is no indication of there being any warranty similar in any way to that which appears at Sched. 11 in the instant contract.  </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The end result, in my judgment, is that SEW has no positive evidence whatsoever that Sched. 11 can be said to be Elster’s standard terms of business.  There are only two possibilities.  The first is that SEW has made no attempt to investigate this point, despite having pleaded a positive – albeit erroneous – case as to the contract as a whole being Elster’s standard terms, in March 2023, and despite having known what Mr Simko was saying in his first witness statement since 5 December 2023.  The second is that it has and that its investigations have revealed nothing of assistance to it and it has chosen to say nothing about this its evidence, which may explain Mr Moores’ silence on a point which one might expect him, rather than Mr Poncia, to cover.</p>

He accepted from his investigations that Elster would seek to include a protective warranty regime into other contracts but, as he said, none which closely resembled Sched. 11.  When challenged by Mr Poncia to provide documentary evidence to this effect he did so in his second witness statement.  The best that Mr Poncia can say – and indeed the best that could be said by Mr Darton KC in submissions – is that pending disclosure this is a point of evidence which should not be determined against SEW at this summary stage.</p>

There is no good reason to conclude that it is even arguable that Mr Simko or anyone assisting him has: (a) consciously only chosen to search for contracts which they already knew did not contain anything like Sched. 11; or, worse still, either (b) suppressed the results of searches actually made which did reveal that contracts were made in or around 2010 which did include the same terms as Schedule 11; or (c) falsely stated that nothing like Sched. 11 was in existence at the time, when they knew that it was in existence, that Elster always tried to include it in contracts, but failed to succeed in the contracts referred  to and attached to his second witness statement.  </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Instead, the documentary evidence which is available shows that: (a) Elster did not even put the first draft of what became Sched. 11 to SEW until a relatively late stage in the tender process and, then, only on the relatively tentative basis of a proposal; (b) Sched. 11, whether in its first draft or eventual form, does not have anything like the appearance of standard terms of business, in that it is: (i) limited to one specific subject, i.e. warranty and fault attribution for one specific event, namely a faulty device being identified in the field; and (ii) clearly very much bespoke to that specific event, where the fault device is that of the AMR unit (including) battery and meter, rather than the whole suite of products offered by Elster – some of which can be seen from the other contracts.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">If, as Mr Moores asserts, there was no previous reference to this warranty and fault attribution provision in the previous tender correspondence, then the only other possible explanation for the reference in the draft to “below conditions already stated in the original commercial response - warranty in respect of Goods &amp; Services and Defects Liability” is that these conditions and thus, presumably, the accompanying warranty itself, were produced and sent in respect of some earlier contractual negotiation, either with SEW or some other business.  Even assuming this, as the most favourable analysis to SEW, it still does not go anywhere near proving that Sched. 11 was Elster’s standard terms of business.  Apart from anything else, the words “warranty in respect of Goods &amp; Services and Defects Liability” is completely different from the words “Meter AMR Warranty and Fault Attribution” used in this contract and, from a comparison, appears to deal with a different – albeit a related - subject matter.</p>

This cannot be difficult in a proper case since anonymised requests about prospective terms of business can be made and participants in the credit market may well have knowledge of how particular lenders go about their business. It cannot be right that any defaulting borrower can just assert that business is being done on standard terms and that the lender then has to disclose the terms of other (how many other?) transactions he has entered into before he is entitled to summary judgment” (paragraph 33).</p>

Evidence, such as has been adduced here and is consistent with the evidence about the genesis of Sched. 11, that Elster did not habitually use  Sched. 11 in other contracts at the time is fatal to SEW’s case.  SEW must either produce some evidence that Elster did habitually use Sched. 11 at the time or some evidence showing grounds for a belief that such evidence is likely to be available at trial. </p>

There is no evidence that this has even been attempted or reason to think that such companies would have had any good reason not to assist if they had been approached and able.  Instead, SEW having raised the issue, Elster has done what Longmore LJ suggested was not even required in that case, by providing disclosure of other transactions which demonstrates that it did not habitually use Sched. 11 in similar transactions at around the same time.  </p>

This is a substantial value claim and SEW is a well-resourced company with access to extremely competent legal advice.  It cannot complain if the court takes the view that it ought, at the hearing of a 2 day application coming on 5 months after the application was issued, and having had sufficient time to appreciate the importance of the point and undertake investigations, have more to show or say than mere surmise and hope that something will turn up, in the face of clear evidence from Elster - made by witness statement verified by statement of truth and backed up by disclosure of relevant documents - which shows that its case is not reasonably arguable.</p>

This disposes of the argument raised by Mr Darton in reliance upon clause 3, which stated: “All Products purchased pursuant to this Agreement shall be subject to the Supply Conditions. All other terms and conditions are expressly excluded from this Agreement pursuant to clause 11.1 of this Agreement”.  Mr Darton submitted that this excluded Sched. 11 from the terms applicable to individual supply orders.  However: (a) clause 11.1 is an entire agreement clause which applies to the framework agreement as a whole and, hence, is irrelevant to the individual supply contracts; and (b) the first sentence does not purport to exclude the terms of the framework agreement as a whole, including therefore the other schedules.  Indeed, since the other schedules includes the specifications of the products and provisions for delivery time and performance it would make no sense – and would indeed be inconsistent with SEW’s reliance upon the contractual specification – for this to be the case.</p>

Whilst obviously true, it cannot be assumed one way or another either that such insurance would have covered against premature failure of the AMR units or batteries therein (and normally liability undertaken by the specific terms of a contract is not included in such policies) or – given the relatively modest value of the individual AMR units (comfortably less than £100) – that the combined replacement and installation cost would not have fallen largely within any excess.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">SEW has pleaded that this imposed a contractual obligation on Elster that the AMR units would have a minimum 10 year battery life.  This is contested by Elster, who submits that the words “must allow for” do not connote an absolute requirement for a minimum 10 year battery life.  I can see much force in this submission.  It seems to me to be more akin to a contractual requirement that the batteries should have a minimum 10 year battery <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">design</span> life than an unqualified warranty for a minimum battery life.  However, for present purposes I am prepared to assume that SEW’s case is reasonably arguable as, also, is its case that for the AMR units to comply with their requirements as to quality and fitness for purpose they needed to have a product life of at least 10 years, and that this application should be approached on that basis.</p>

It is probable that the first contradiction is explained by the commercial reality, which is that Elster would replace both AMR unit and meter in any case where it had to replace the AMR unit, and that the second contradiction is simply an error in example 3.

Whether or not that is in fact correct as a matter of procurement law is not a matter for me to determine in the context of this application.  Even if it is correct, and even if that is what SEW believed at the time, there is no evidence to suggest that there was any contemporaneous communication between Elster and SEW in which either said or did anything capable, even arguably, of leading to the conclusion that this was a common shared assumption, or that Elster was aware that SEW was operating under a mistake as to its effect or that it believed SEW must have been operating under a mistake because otherwise it would have re-tendered the tender process.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">Thus, at the end of paragraph 27 of his witness statement Mr Moores says, without providing any supporting detail: “I believe that Elster was fairly experienced in tendering for contracts from water companies and would have known that the procurement process would not permit one supplier to introduce into the contract a limitation of liability that was not offered to other suppliers”.  This seems to me to be complete speculation on his part.  Moreover, SEW has not pleaded or advanced a case for rescission for mutual mistake or for rectification based on some alleged common intention or understanding, or for estoppel by convention, notwithstanding the purported reservation of rights in paragraph 38 of Mr Poncia’s witness statement.  I am unable to place any weight on what is plainly a throwaway comment, made without any supporting evidence to justify it, by Mr Moores.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">Returning then to the objective interpretation of Sched. 11, I have no doubt that Elster is correct as to what it says is its plain and obvious meaning from the clear words used, although – as I shall explain below - I do not accept that this means that it is not a limitation clause.  As Mr Power submits, the heading does not simply say “AMR warranty” but also “&amp; fault attribution”.  Whilst these words in isolation do not necessarily indicate with complete clarity the intended effect of the schedule, the words appearing immediately after that make it quite clear that it is intended to have the effect of <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">limiting</span> SEW’s entitlement in respect of any claim in relation to a faulty AMR unit identified in operation to the cost of an equivalent replacement device and any incidental costs to the warranty set out below.  It is, frankly, hard to see how its wording could have been improved in terms of conveying its intended effect to the intended reader.  It has the undoubted merit of simplicity and clarity instead of being concealed in a thicket of legal boilerplate.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">It is of course true that it must be read as part of the whole agreement, in accordance with the general principle recorded by Coulson LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">Hopkins</span> at paragraph 46.  SEW relies upon Sched. 2 and cond. 13 in particular to seek to argue its contrary interpretation.  However, in my judgment it is simply not possible to read Sched. 11 as being a mere adjunct or alternative to the right conferred on SEW at its election under cond. 13.1.3 of Sched. 2 to give Elster the opportunity to supply replacement products at its own expense.  Apart from anything else, Sched. 11 cannot be read as only applying in the limited case where SEW elected to invoke its cond. 13.1.3 remedy because: (a) it is not stated to depend on SEW choosing this option; and (b) the extent of Elster’s obligations under Sched. 11 are plainly less than the which rights which SEW would have under clause 13.1.3, namely to require Elster to supply replacement products and to carry out any other necessary work entirely at its own expense.  </p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">SEW suggests that clearer words would have been needed to exclude the full panoply of rights conferred by cond. 13.  However, as Elster contends, there is no need to make it explicit in cond. 13 that it is subject to Sched. 11.  As Mr Power observes, the rights conferred by cond. 13 are already circumscribed by clause 9.4 of the framework agreement, even though neither cond. 13 nor clause 9.4 expressly refer to each other.  Although, as I have said, SEW’s alleged belief at the time is irrelevant anyway, it is frankly difficult to conceive how anyone reading Sched. 2 and Sched. 11, even as a non-lawyer and even only briefly, could ever have believed that Sched. 11 was intended only to give SEW an additional and optional right or remedy.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">SEW also contends that clause 3 of the framework agreement operates as some form of order of precedence clause by which the Sched. 2 conditions are to have more weight than anything contained in Sched. 11.  But there is no basis for reading clause 3 in this way.  To the contrary, I prefer Elster’s submission, based on the further principle of contract construction also summarised in paragraph 46 of <span style="font-style:italic">Hopkins</span>, that “where a contract contains general provisions and specific provisions which potentially contradict each other, the specific provisions will be given greater weight”.  I was also referred in this context to the decision of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Yarm Road Ltd v Hewden Tower Cranes Ltd</span> [2003] EWCA Civ 1127 and, in particular, the judgment of Laws LJ at paragraph 41.  It is undoubtedly the case that Sched. 11 deals with the specific case of a faulty device being identified in operation, whereas cond. 13 deals with the more general case of any failure of products supplied to accord with the terms of the contract.  It follows that Sched. 11 should apply in precedence to cond. 13 in the specific circumstances where it does apply, which include the current case.</p>

This process was defined as the “Project” and involved the agreement of Elster to supply new products where the existing were identified as defective as well as its agreement to pay certain specified contributory costs.  Nonetheless, Sched. 11 was left unaffected and, indeed, clause 2.5 provided that Elster’s agreement in this respect was “without admission of any liability and without prejudice to any limitations of its obligations set out in the Framework as amended by clause 3 below, including those related to warranties provided in respect of the Meters”.</p>

However, neither party identified any variation of particular relevance, save only that by clause 3.3 a new clause 9.5 of the framework agreement and clause 5.2 of Sched. 2 was introduced which limited Elster’s total aggregate liability to £10 million.  Although there was some tentative suggestion by SEW that it is difficult to see why this should have been introduced if Sched. 11 had the effect now contended for, such an argument would have been hopeless even without clause 2.5.</p>

It does not seem to me to be obviously either a genuine liquidated damages clause or a clause closely akin to such.  The reality is, it seems to me, that if there was a claim that the AMR unit was faulty and that this was a breach of contract which justified replacement, then the warranty would at least arguably offer less than the full cost of removal and replacement, notwithstanding that the warranty also offered more than the 10 year battery life (arguably) required by the specification.</p>

Second, whilst it applies in the context of SEW having the benefit of wide ranging rights as regards the obligations owed by Elster and the remedies enjoyed by SEW in relation to the quality of and defects in the products, such remedies are also effectively limited in relation to claims falling within clause 9.4 of the framework agreement, and thus including claims for loss of profit, business, goodwill, contracts, revenues, anticipated savings, or special or indirect or consequential damage of any nature whatsoever.</p>

Thus, there is no positive evidence that the cost would be significantly more than the £40 contribution provided for by Sched. 11.  Given Mr Moores’ evidence as to what he (and others in SEW) believed at the time was the intent and effect of Sched. 11 at the time of contracting, he would undoubtedly have said so had it been the case that £40 was a very low figure for what appears to have been a relatively straightforward operation.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">In the first 5 years the AMR units are supplied free of charge.  In the first two years the meters are also supplied free of charge.   As I have said, the position is not entirely clear as regards the meters in years 3 onwards.  However, if the position is governed by the examples, which it seems to me it must be since they were put forward by Elster with a view to explaining the meaning and effect of the table, the meters would be replaced free of charge as part of a composite meter and AMR device.  After year 5 the replacement cost contribution for the AMR unit (and meter, applying example 2) is a sliding scale which bears a linear correlation to the age of the unit.  Although Mr Darton argued that this is allowing SEW less than its contractual entitlement to recover the full cost of a replacement without having to give credit for the full use already made of the unit in the preceding years, that seems to me to be moot.  The benefit of the Sched. 11 warranty is that it provides a sensible commercial arrangement, based on a straight line discounting approach, to arrive at the value of replacement units up to a 15 year end point.  It is difficult to see how this could be viewed as in any way unreasonable, especially when the contract specification was only for a 10 year battery life.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">SEW’s failure to put forward any positive evidence on the cost of replacing units is compounded by its resolute refusal to provide particulars of its pleaded case for existing and future replacement costs, so as to permit any comparison between its pleaded case and the impact of Schedule 11 on its recovery of replacement costs.  In Elster’s solicitors’ letter dated 2 February 2024 they referred to the fact that it had requested information about replacement costs as long ago as April 2023, which was not provided, even though the pleaded claim included specific figures in relation to such claims.   In that letter it repeated its request for information as to how the sums claimed had been calculated, saying that the information was required so that it could be placed before the court at the hearing of this application.  In its letter of reply dated 16 February 2024 SEW declined to do so, giving no reasons which in my view justified this refusal.  It appears from the evidence served by SEW that the real reason is because the pleaded costs are based on a diminution in value basis rather than a cost of replacement basis.  It follows in my judgment that SEW cannot complain if, for the purposes of determining reasonableness, the court is not in a position to make a finding one way or another as to the disparity between actual replacement costs as they would have been anticipated at the time the framework agreement was entered into and the value of the warranty provided in Sched. 11.  </p>

It is difficult to conceive, for example, of a faulty device causing a catastrophic loss, whether to SEW or to some third party to whom SEW might incur some liability.  Thus, the limitation of liability is not obviously disproportionate to the actual likely loss.  This is not, therefore, a case where issues relating to resources, insurance or ability to pass claims down the line are of significance.</p>

It was introduced quite openly in a letter written in response to a request for clarification during the course of contract negotiations.  It is, as I have said, about as clear as one could hope for in terms of its language and effect.  It is concise.  It occupies its own separate schedule and its impact is clearly explained in the heading and the first sentence.  If SEW misunderstood its effect, as I have said I find that extremely surprising and on any view there is no suggestion that this was known to Elster, i.e. this is not a sharp practice case.</p>

Here, SEW was conducting a tender exercise and there were other tenderers against whom Elster was in open competition.  The letter introducing what became Sched. 11 made clear that the provision was a proposal and introduced the option of negotiation.  SEW does not suggest that Elster was the only tenderer who supplied a compliant tender or that there was some feature of Elster’s tender which meant that it was the only available option for SEW, let alone that Elster knew of this and exploited this to its own advantage.  There is evidence from SEW that the other tenderers also insisted on similar or even more wide-ranging limitation clauses.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">There is no evidence or argument from SEW identifying what, if any, other material facts could be placed before the court at any trial which SEW has not already had the opportunity to place before the court at the hearing of this application.  It is again worthy of note that this case has been listed and argued over 2 days with plentiful opportunity for both parties to adduce evidence beforehand.  Thus, although SEW can say that it has not had the benefit of disclosure or cross-examination, those are really the only differences between the position in this case and the position in many other cases, such as the <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Goodlife</span> case referred to in <span style="font-style:italic;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Last Bus</span>, where reasonableness under UCTA is tried as a preliminary issue.  It is difficult to see, and SEW has not identified, what difference disclosure and/or cross-examination could reasonably be expected to make in a case such as the present where, in my judgment, the position is so clear cut in Elster’s favour.</p>

            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in;text-indent:0.12in">In the circumstances, it seems to me to be wholly unrealistic that any trial judge could find that Elster had not discharged the burden of showing reasonableness, regardless of any further evidence which SEW has any realistic prospect of adducing at any trial.  In the circumstances this is another reason for finding in favour of Elster on this application.</p>

However, the question which arises is whether or not SEW can maintain a damages or other monetary claim based either on any alleged failure by Elster to comply with its Sched. 11 obligations or on the claim being limited to the cost to Elster of complying with its Sched. 11 obligations.  Such issues can only be determined if, as and when an alternative pleaded case is advanced.</p>

Again, as with paragraphs 32(i) and (vi), if there is a viable alternative case to be pleaded then SEW will have the opportunity to do so, although it is less obvious how that could be the case here.</p>

They are also obviously claims for a loss of anticipated savings and, hence, barred by clause 9.4, since the whole purpose of the AMR units was to save the need for manually reading the meters.  The same comment as under paragraph 32(ii) applies to this and to all of the other claims addressed below.</p>

Although there has been some attempt to re-categorise these claims as for the cost of supplying water which could not be charged for, whether at all or as envisaged through using a remote read meter, on any view that is still in substance a loss of profit or revenue or, if not, a loss of anticipated savings and, hence still excluded.</p>

It may well be, however, that the parties should be encouraged – if not ordered – to engage in ADR at that point since as a result of this judgment the parties should both know the likely parameters of the claim which can now be made.</p>
