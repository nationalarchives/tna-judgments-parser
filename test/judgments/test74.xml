The proceedings were commenced initially by the submission to the Tribunal of forms T1 and T2 by Ms Bartram, both dated 23 September 2019.  Mr Howe submitted his forms T1 and T2 on 29 February 2020.  Although the papers of Ms Bartram were submitted first, the claim and complaint of Mr Howe were the central focus of the relevant events and therefore his complaints shall be dealt with as the lead case. </span></p>

In accordance with normal procedures, the Respondent was provided with details of the contents of the forms T1 and T2 and required to provide all relevant documentation to the Tribunal having regard to the nature of the allegations made by the Complainants.  Because of the common background facts, and the importance of the issue of jurisdiction, the parties agreed that both cases should be heard together.  It is important to record that both cases must be considered separately as they give rise to different considerations.  </span></p>

The investigation took place in 2018 with a view to establishing whether he had breached any of the standards of professional behaviour set out in the British Transport Police (Conduct) Regulations 2015.  Following such an investigation if a determination were made that a case to answer was established for breach of such standards, it would lead to disciplinary proceedings either for misconduct or gross misconduct, depending on the gravity of the facts uncovered.</span></p>

A so-called Tactical Deployment Authorisation (TDA) was accordingly sought by PC Clarke.  The application, which was provided to the Tribunal, was submitted to Superintendent Gillian Murray who was the head of the Professional Standards Department at the time.  She granted the authorisation, but with important restrictions, on 25 July 2018.  In her witness statement she explained that a TDA is a process set in place by BTP following the decision of this Tribunal in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">C v The Police</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">, in 2006, to authorise, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">inter alia</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">, the use of surveillance in a police non-criminal disciplinary investigation.

It would be difficult to find any significant distinction in the two processes.  In her witness statement Superintendent Murray said it was her understanding the system was “designed to ensure that there was a process of systematic and careful consideration of questions of necessity and proportionality of proposed surveillance in misconduct investigations, following a process similar to that under RIPA, notwithstanding that RIPA did not apply”.</span></p>

The specific object of the surveillance was to further the investigation by proving or disproving whether PC Howe was attending Ms Bartram’s address during his hours of duty.  The way in which the surveillance was carried out has also given rise to the complaint by Ms Bartram.  As part of the investigation, a vehicle with two remote control cameras was parked close to her house to take footage showing PC Howe arriving at or leaving the house.  The cameras were activated when the vehicle was put in position and the images were viewed and recorded remotely, using an iPad, only when it appeared that Mr Howe was going to or leaving the house.  The only footage retained was when Mr Howe’s car, or he personally, was in view. </span></p>

Ms Bartram was seen to exit the car and go into her house.  She returned shortly afterwards and they drove off together.  On 24th August the camera was again in place and activated. PC Howe was seen outside Ms Bartram’s house heading towards the front door.  Sometime later PC Clarke returned to the scene and deactivated the camera in the vehicle with the intention of driving it away.  Before he left the scene, however, he saw Mr Howe, Ms Bartram and a young boy leave the house and get into a car.  PC Clarke did not have time to reactivate the camera and took three photographs using the camera on his mobile phone.   </span></p>

They accepted there were times during the covert misconduct investigation carried out by PSDIU/CCU when they considered whether PC Howe may have committed criminal offences, but those considerations did not crystallise into a suspicion that he had done so and he was not investigated for criminal offences. </span></p>

He pointed out that the BTP documents referred to the nature, circumstances and timing of Mr Howe’s relationship with Ms Bartram and “whether (the alleged relationship) was an abuse of his position for sexual predatory behaviour”: they also mentioned that </span><br /><span style="font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Mr Howe was “currently dealing with a crime that includes another vulnerable victim”.  He pointed out that improperly exercising the powers and privileges of a constable knowingly could bring a sentence of up to 14 years imprisonment on conviction (see s. 26 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015).  He said further the BTP papers  revealed concerns about the possibility that he might be using his position to facilitate a sexual relationship in a sexually predatory way and that there were additional concerns that his unapproved absences from duty could involve fraudulently claiming expenses.  He submitted there was potentially serious criminality involved and that “to miscategorise the … matters, whether that be conscious, subconscious or merely inadvertent, cannot…turn matters that are clearly potentially serious criminal conduct into matters that fall into a ‘non</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">-</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">criminal conduct genre’.  On such an analysis it would be arguable that any behaviour of a police officer whilst engaged in the execution his duties, whatever the serious nature of the criminality involved, could be so categorised as a ‘non-criminal misconduct’ matter as the force so pleased.”  His submission also made the case that the use of Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) data by BTP had been intended to acquire private information, namely, that Mr Howe was travelling to, from and otherwise en route to a specified address.  It was alleged further that the actions of a fellow police officer (PC X) amounted to his being tasked as a Covert Human Intelligence Source (CHIS) without an authorisation being granted either under RIPA or the BTP’s own system of TDA.  It was also argued that the actions of the officer conducting the surveillance at or about Ms Bartram’s address on several occasions rendered him a CHIS.  The thrust of the submission therefore was that the provisions of s. 28(3)(b) of RIPA applied (the prevention and detection of crime), but reliance on s. 28(3)(d) (the interests of public safety) or other provisions was not raised. </span></p>

She submitted that since these, in effect, mirrored two of the bases upon which directed surveillance under RIPA Part II might be authorised “there was no reason in principle why they should be available to justify surveillance for the purpose of Article 8(2) but not available to authorise the same surveillance under RIPA”.  There was good reason to do so, she said, because a “central function of the police misconduct regime is the maintenance of public confidence in policing which is a factor of great importance in the maintenance of law and order….the loss of which could put public safety at risk or reduce the ability of the police to prevent crime or disorder”.  In those circumstances it would be anomalous if the parties in these proceedings were to be deprived of the safeguards afforded by RIPA had the same techniques been authorised in the context of a criminal investigation, just because they were deployed in a disciplinary investigation.</span></p>

It provides authoritative guidance for public authorities investigating misconduct by an employee (in this case Mr Howe was deemed by statute to be an employee) in the course of their duties or working time.  The dividing line is particularly important for the police forces of the U.K., because as mentioned earlier, misconduct by an officer may involve behaviour which is also potentially criminal.  That is evident in the present case as such offences as obtaining a pecuniary advantage by deception, improper use of his authority as a police constable contrary to s. 26 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act, 2015, or misconduct in a public office might have been committed.  At some point a police misconduct investigation may reveal evidence which requires that it becomes a criminal investigation and, if so, there is no uncertainty about the position should surveillance be desired as thereafter a RIPA authorisation should be sought if surveillance is planned.  </span></p>

If the police wish to conduct directed surveillance the application must first satisfy the definition of same in s. 26(2), namely that it is for the purpose of a specific investigation, is likely to result in the obtaining of private information and is otherwise than an immediate response to events or circumstances.  The relevant officer must then believe the authorisation being sought is necessary on grounds falling within sub-s. (3) and is proportionate to the object to be achieved, before (s)he can grant same.  Clearly, therefore, surveillance may only be authorised under RIPA in limited circumstances and it may not be permissible to grant it even when the investigation is of a type mentioned in s. 26(3).  The Tribunal in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">C</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial"> then went further and added that RIPA had no application in the affairs of public authorities unless the investigation related to one of its core functions.  Drawing on the seriousness of the nature of the investigations contemplated by the list of grounds in s. 26(3), the Tribunal concluded that authorisations were only permissible if they related to a core function of the public body connected with those grounds and which are distinct from the ordinary functions public authorities share with all authorities and undertakings such as the employment of staff and the making of contracts. That is a gloss on RIPA as there is no reference to “core functions” in the Act.  The importance of the matter was reiterated later however when the footnote was added to the decision in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Mr and Mrs H v Police Federation of Great Britain</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">.  </span></p>

The case was brought in the Court of Session and concerned a civil claim for breach of Article 8(2) of the ECHR.  Access to the pursuer’s WhatsApp messaging had been obtained by the police in the context of a criminal investigation and the information was then handed over to their Professional Standards Department.  The acquisition of the WhatsApp message did not result from directed surveillance under RIPA.  The police said their actions were for the investigation or prevention of crime or for the protection of the public by way of a defence to a claim under s. 7 HRA for breach of Article 8 ECHR.  In the event the Inner House held that Article 8 was not engaged.  It does not follow that where an investigation may have those effects that RIPA Pt II applies as it is essential to have regard to the true nature and objects of the investigation before it does so.  As noted, there are very many cases in which police misconduct may involve, or border upon, criminal behaviour.  That does not make every ensuing inquiry a criminal investigation, or one intended to protect the public so as to attract RIPA and the jurisdiction of this Tribunal.  Both the Inner and Outer Houses agreed that police misconduct should be regulated by a proper and efficient disciplinary process and this is provided by statute in the form of the 2015 Regulations, but they made no attempt to suggest that the Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000 applied to the </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial">Police Scotland</span><span style="font-weight:normal;font-family:'Times New Roman';color:initial"> investigation. </span></p>

She also attached significance to the skills, techniques and equipment available to the police to carry out surveillance, but I cannot see the relevance of this to the legal point in issue.</span></p>

The only two that are arguably relevant are the economic well-being of the UK (in cases such as the instant one where the officer is being paid for work he has not done) and public safety (if it can be shown that the misconduct is of a kind that may put the safety of the public at risk).

(The Home Secretary is empowered by s. 28(3)(g) to add to this list by order, but nothing else in Art 8(2) seems apposite and a bespoke ground – such as “for the purpose of maintaining public confidence in the police” or, more broadly, “for the purpose of maintaining standards of integrity and propriety in the public service” – would not only leave the respondent authority vulnerable to challenge in Strasbourg but would be equally nugatory in the domestic courts, since a defence to an action brought under s. 7 of the HRA would not satisfy the requirements of Art 8(2) even if justifiable under RIPA.)</span></p>

The police seemed to assume that, as the surveillance involved no infringement of the ordinary criminal or civil law, they had no need of the protection afforded by RIPA, but this betrayed an imperfect understanding of the impact of the HRA and ECHR, which is that the unlawfulness arises exclusively from the interference with privacy regardless of any other legal provisions: such interference by a public body under Art 8(1) is unlawful unless it can be justified under Art 8(2) and any such justification would have to be “in accordance with the law”. Mummery LJ for his part realised this. While explaining convincingly why it should not fall within the RIPA regime, he acknowledged that such matters fell to be litigated in the ordinary courts if RIPA did not apply (para 89), but considered it “unnecessary and undesirable to express a view on . . . whether the interference with the Art 8(1) right was ‘in accordance with the law’  for the purposes of Art 8(2)” (para 91). In other words, the potential vulnerability of the police, without the shield of RIPA, to liability under Art 8(1) was not a factor that could override the other objections to bringing such matters within the ambit of RIPA.</span></p>

Mummery LJ saw no reason to treat public and private bodies any differently with respect to such matters as employment and contracts, but this is to overlook the fact that a public authority is governed by the HRA whereas non-public bodies (for the most part) are not. The latter may therefore lawfully engage in activities which in the case of a public body would render it liable for a breach of Art 8(1). But if that had been in the mind of Parliamentary Counsel when drafting RIPA, he or she would have given the appropriate powers to all public bodies, not just the few identified for the purpose of Part II of RIPA. Mummery LJ’s conclusion, therefore, seems irresistible. RIPA is not the appropriate vehicle for this purpose.</span></p>

That would not have to be, and perhaps should not be, under the RIPA umbrella. The same problem arises for all public bodies.
