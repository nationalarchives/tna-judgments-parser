          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The central claims made by Sahara against Sonara are simple. They are for breach of (i) a contract dated 14 January 2013 (“the 2013 Contract”) for the purchase of crude oil, (ii) various further crude oil contracts concluded in 2014, 2015 and 2016. This apparently simple case has however given rise to a raft of legal and factual issues. </p>

          <num>2.</num>
          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The first complication is that the claims are not pursued simply, or even primarily, as claims for breach of those contracts. They are ultimately substantially based on a “Joint Report” dated 5 September 2019 following a “reconciliation meeting” between the parties.  This Joint Report is said by Sahara to encapsulate an agreement settling disputes as to the various elements of the claims.</p>

          <intro>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The second complication is that the claims have layers. Sahara originally claimed both principal sums and interest (including both contractual interest and what is referred to as Incremental Interest) as well as default changes and foreign exchange differential in relation to four cargoes. What remains in issue now are only the elements other than principal and contractual interest (which have been paid). There are three disputed heads of claim:</p>

              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.11in">FX losses arising from cargoes charged in Euros, which equate to the difference between the figure produced by a conversion to Euros at invoice date and the ultimate payment date (the Euro having fallen against the US dollar in the relevant period).</p>

          <num>4.</num>
          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The reason why all these different elements arise is this: Sonara did not pay for one cargo until 2016, and the other three outstanding cargoes until 2019. Therefore, whilst Sonara was contractually obliged to pay for the cargoes in under 4 months, it in fact paid for them only after 5-6 years. Sahara’s claims are therefore ones which they make to make themselves good for this extremely long delay – in essence Sahara says that because of the delay its own banks hit it with raised and ultimately penal interest charges and it lost money on the $/€ conversion.</p>

          <num>5.</num>
          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The fact of the delay is not in issue. Nor, really, is the contention that Sahara has suffered many of the losses it claims to have done – though the exact amount of proved quantum is in issue. What is the main issue is whether these losses are recoverable under the terms of the contracts or the Joint Report and whether it is now too late for Sahara to claim them.</p>

          <intro>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Sonara does not dispute that there were breaches of contract but says that those were compensated as agreed under the Contract. It says it never owed to Sahara the Incremental interest on 2013 cargoes and/or 2013 Default charges and/or or 2013 FX differential. The claim is disputed by Sonara on the basis that:</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The key point relating to the Banks is the increase in the interest which underpins the Incremental Interest claim. There are some disputes as to the precise interest rates raised by Sonara’s expert Mr Good, but for present purposes they are not material. Access Bank raised its interest rate slightly from 4% to 5% in February 2015. However on 26 November 2014 Access Bank’s interest rate was unilaterally increased to 7.5%,  in large part for reasons specific to the Nigerian economy which was aiming to preserve its external reserves which had been under pressure from declining oil revenues and dollar receipts. On 17 February 2015 that rate was raised again to 9.5%. A further increase to 11.5% followed in July 2015 and to 12% from October 2015.</p>

Sahara presented its claims. The outcome of the meeting is documented in a letter from Sonara dated 20 March 2017, which stated that Sonara “<span style="font-style:italic">rejected in block”</span> Sahara’s claims. As to foreign exchange exposure, Sonara appeared to reject the claim because Sahara should “<span style="font-style:italic">respect the commercial contract governing each operation</span>”. As to “penal charges”, Sonara’s position was that <span style="font-style:italic">“claim not justified”</span>. As to “interest charges”, Sonara did not appear to reject the claim outright but stated “<span style="font-style:italic">Parties shall proceed with interest reconciliation until a compromise is reached</span>.” Minutes of the meeting show that the parties discussed the relevant invoices in some detail looking into such matters as late LC charges, LIBOR rate applied, value dates of SWIFT payments and Euro conversion rates.</p>

In respect of the 2013 cargoes, there was a dispute as to whether Sahara was in principle entitled to claim for forex differentials, certain interest, and penal charges. In any event, Sonara asked Sahara “<span style="font-style:italic">to make best endeavours to provide all justification documents from their banks</span>”.

Sonara informed Sahara DMCC of these events by way of a letter dated 1 June 2019 and declared this a “Force Majeure” event under the Term Contract.  </p>

For Sahara it was contended that based on the admissible material (i.e. taking into account the pressure from bankers on one side and the Swap finances on the other but ignoring negotiations and subjective interpretations) the language of the Joint Report leads to a conclusion that there was a binding agreement, and that it extended to the items labelled “undisputed”. Sahara says the Agreement is an agreement – a contract, and that the parties’ label of “Undisputed” is clear and unambiguous.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Sonara’s position on this was not entirely consistent. Its pleaded case at paragraph 19 of its defence is that it “<span style="font-style:italic">…recorded certain agreements… specifically the agreements that SONARA would pay to Sahara the sums identified at paragraphs 11(c) to 11(g). However, it is denied that the Joint Report constitutes a contract or agreement and/or that it contains or gives rise to any contractual obligations and/or agreements</span>”. In closing however it accepted that the reasonable objective interpretation of the document was that as regards “Reconciled Claims” Sonara would pay them.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">So far as the contentious matters are concerned, Sonara says that the Joint Report document does not refer to any of the three extant claims as being agreed. It does not include them under “Reconciled” claims (which is how the claims for contractual interest are separately recorded in the same document). Rather it records (i) that the “undisputed claims” (the claims for incremental interest and FX claims) are to be the subject of continued negotiation and (ii) that Sahara completely rejects all Penal Charges. Accordingly Sonara contends that Sahara’s primary case that there is a binding agreement to pay the sums claimed for incremental interest and FX claims is fanciful and must fail.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">As to negotiations Sonara does place more emphasis on these (both before and at the September Meeting). In particular Sonara place emphasis on the drafts of the Joint Report and specifically how the FX and Incremental Interest claims had been moved into “Disputed Items”. It contends that it is settled law that in deciding whether negotiations have led to a binding settlement agreement the Court will look at the full negotiations which of course includes evidence of the meetings leading to the Joint Report and the documents exchanged between the Parties. It says that against this fuller background I should scrutinise the suggestion of an agreement with particular care as running against the tide of the previous correspondence.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">There was therefore technically a debate on the admissibility of the evidence from the negotiations (and the parties’ actions after the Joint Report was signed). That debate hinged on the question of whether one was considering a question of whether an agreement was concluded, in which case the materials would be admissible, or whether the issue was one of construction.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Certainly as regarded the negotiations, the debate as to admissibility was not entered into very wholeheartedly, because both parties found material they wished to rely on within the negotiations. As I will endeavour to explain below in fact adopting either approach leads to the same conclusion.</p>

The effect of the signatures on a preprepared signature grid – and of the careful initialling of every page of the document - is suggestive.

Interposing the iterative stage in relation to this point here, that initial impression is reinforced, not contradicted, if one follows through the drafting history: the bullet point was put in originally to record what Sahara hoped would be a final binding agreement on all points except the Penal Charges.</p>

The submission that the reference to “This AGREEMENT” in the very final bullet point is determinative because there is no language confining it to parts of the Joint Report cannot stand when (i) as noted, this is not a formally lawyered document (ii) on any analysis the agreement could only ever extend to parts of the claims (ie. not the disputed claims) and (iii) the parties (despite having lawyers present) did not call the entire document Agreement, or Settlement Agreement. When it came to titles, they called it a Joint Report.</p>

Stripped of all context, it does indeed suggest a purely binary answer. But in a context where (i) there were two categories ahead of the “disputed” items (ii) both of those different categories suggest agreement, and yet are not taken together and (iii) there had been two areas of discussion over the years, one as to the maths and one as to liability, “undisputed” could very obviously mean undisputed as to liability, undisputed as to quantum, or both. In context - specifically given the content of that section - it appears clear that of the two categories the parties intended “Reconciled” to refer to “undisputed as to both”. That simply as a matter of logic suggested the parties intended “Undisputed” to cover either undisputed as to liability (but disputed as to quantum) or undisputed as to quantum (but disputed as to liability). Sahara’s case as to the extent of agreement is not therefore as strong as it might appear.</p>

While Sahara’s case on this was extremely well put both in writing and orally in my judgment it gave too much weight to the simple word “undisputed” and insufficient weight to the natural meaning of “negotiations”. While the natural meaning of “negotiations” could conceivably be read down if “undisputed” could really have only one meaning, where that is not the case, “negotiations” has to be given its natural meaning if that is possible. As Sonara contended, the clear resolution that <span style="font-style:italic">“the Parties will reconvene for … further negotiations on the Undisputed Claims”</span> is at least extremely difficult for Sahara’s case.  On an objective reading of the whole document the use of the word “undisputed claims” does not comprise an acceptance that Sonara agrees to pay the Incremental Interest or FX Losses in the sums claimed or in any sums.</p>

In context it makes perfect sense for it to be read thus: “<span style="font-style:italic">for parties to reconvene, SONARA to propose potential flexible payment terms, schedule [agreed: principal/reconciled] and further negotiations on the undisputed claims.

There had been a number of reconciliation meetings in which Sahara had pressed for payment and where Sonara had made clear that they were not persuaded that the claims fell within the boundaries of their contractual liability. There is the unlikelihood of Sonara, in the financial position it was in, agreeing any liability that was not clearly established. </p>

Secondly Sahara had made clear that the issue was very pressing and that it wanted to reach a position where it could expect payment – and it had something to give to its by now fractious banks. Then there is the fact that the parties knew that Cameroon Government agreement would be needed for anything not demonstrably due from Sonara, particularly in light of the financial crisis at Sonara caused by the refinery fire in 2019. Sonara was dependent on the Government of Cameroon for support.</p>

Having said that, what Sonara were contending for (which does depend for its precise formulation on what is said to have been said at the meeting) may in essence equate to the possibility floated above of “Undisputed as to quantum”, at least as regards the interest elements. The reason for this is that since interest is a necessary incident of bank borrowing, the quantum of the charges would be the main basis upon which Sahara could dispute the charges with their bank. If Sahara had agreed quantum with the banks, it was in a position to verify the amount it was seeking to claim from Sonara – at which point there would be no issue between Sahara and Sonara that Sahara had a liability in x amount, but liability might remain in issue as between them. I also note that Sonara’s precise characterisation obviously cannot apply to the forex claims which were not charges imposed by banks. </p>

In other words, during the course of the meeting the parties had agreed that that some of the figures originally put forward were not quite right and that the new figures were right.</p>

The same can be said in reverse for Sonara’s characterisation, which involved an implausible definitional statement from Sahara. I reject Ms Nsoh’s evidence on this point, which resonated with hindsight and wishful thinking.

There is the fact that the document was never drafted or signed off on as a Settlement Agreement; nor was there any internal report at Sahara of agreement. There is the emphasis on continued trade and approval of the Government of Cameroon with Sonara’s GM saying at the beginning of the meeting that he wanted a <span style="font-style:italic">“…quick resolution in a bid to allow Sahara to resume petroleum product supplies to Sonara”</span> combined with the wording for onward submission<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> There is the fact that after the Joint Report had been signed off Sonara reverted to the approach they had taken before – and were not met with shouts of outrage, on the basis that they had agreed liability for Incremental Interest and FX.</p>

And there was an “agreement” that Sahara had become liable for  Incremental Interest and FX in amounts which looked right, to put the matter before the Government of Cameroon (which might take a pragmatic view) and then to come back to negotiate if there was no agreement by the Government to pay or to support payment. On that basis the “agreement” as to the “Undisputed Claims” was no contractual agreement; it was at best an agreement to agree. </p>

With three clauses, all of which can on their face have relevance one should expect to find a scheme in which each plays a part.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The contention advanced is that Clause 8 comprises the agreed damages for a failure to make payment on time and is a binding liquidated damages provision such that it is not open to Sahara to claim its (alleged) actual interest (the Incremental Interest Claims) or the alleged damage said to be suffered as a result of the delayed payment (the FX claims and Penal Charges claims). The basis upon which Sonara advances this case is a broad one; it says that as a matter of principle default interest clauses are liquidated damages provisions. It relies upon two textbook citations (Benjamin’s <span style="font-style:italic">Sale of Goods</span> 12<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Edition at 13-035 and <span style="font-style:italic">Petroleum Contracts</span>, Roberts 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span>  Edition at 20-013); but more substantially upon the argument that it is apparent from a list of cases where the question of whether a default interest clause is a penalty have been considered, that default interest provisions i.e. payment of interest for delayed payment on non-payment (which is a breach of contract) are by nature liquidated damages clauses. So Sonara says, because those cases say that the clauses in question were liquidated damages clause, this clause is also a liquidated damages clause. The cases in question were: <span style="font-style:italic">Lordvale Finance plc v Bank of Zambia</span> [1996] QB 752 at 763-764; <span style="font-style:italic">Jeancharm Ltd (t/a Beaver International) v Barnet Football Club Ltd</span> [2003] EWCA Civ 58 at [9]-[19]; <span style="font-style:italic">First Personnel Services Ltd v Halfords Ltd</span> [2016] EWHC 3220 (Ch) at [161]¬[163]; <span style="font-style:italic">Biosol Renewables UK Ltd v Lovering &amp; Anor (t/a R &amp; A Properties (A Partnership)</span> [2021] EWHC 71 (Comm) at [310]-[316]; <span style="font-style:italic">Ahuja Investments Ltd v Victorygame Ltd &amp; Anor</span> [2021] EWHC 2382 (Ch) at [131]-[145]; <span style="font-style:italic">Hossein and Ors v London Credit Ltd and Another</span> [2024] EWCA Civ 721 at [32]-[57].</p>

As observed in the hearing these authorities cannot dictate the answer on this iteration of the argument. None of them is a case which purports to lay down (as ratio) any proposition that all default interest clauses are liquidated damages clauses. In the cases cited the fact that the clauses were liquidated damages clauses is revealed by the fact that arguments as to penalty (the dark side of liquidated damages) were in play. But that does not mean that all contractual interest clauses are liquidated damages clauses.</p>

In that case the shipowner argued that it should be entitled to recover costs of settling claims with the cargo owners in addition to the demurrage.</p>

Our conclusion is that, in the absence of any contrary indication in a particular charterparty, demurrage liquidates the whole of the damages arising from a charterer's breach of charter in failing to complete cargo operations within the laytime and not merely some of them. Accordingly, if a shipowner seeks to recover damages in addition to demurrage arising from delay, it must prove a breach of a separate obligation. Our reasons are as follows.</p>

Such an agreement forfeits many of the benefits of a liquidated damages clause which, in general, provides valuable certainty and avoids dispute. There is nothing in the charterparty or in the standard definitions of demurrage (including that from Scrutton which we have quoted above) to suggest that the parties in this case had such an intention. …”</p>

It is a case dealing with a very particular issue in a very particular context – demurrage in voyage charterparties. Whatever controversy there may in the past have been about the nature of demurrage, by the time of the <span style="font-style:italic">Eternal Bliss</span> it was well established, and the case proceeded on the basis that, a demurrage clause is a clause liquidating damages for a particular breach namely failure to load or discharge a vessel within the laytime. The controversy with which it grappled was the question of whether it liquidated all losses, or whether there was scope for other losses to be claimed – but that was a question which arose against that very specialist background and coming from a premise that everybody involved would know that the clause was a liquidated damages clause. The Court of Appeal did not consider liquidated damages clauses more generally – and it is notable that the authorities to which they were referred were ones which related to this particular field, not general authorities as to liquidated damages.</p>

Doubtless the Court is right that once a liquidated damages clause is found to exist the question of commerciality will have considerable influence in evaluating whether on the facts of that case the parties intended that that specific liquidated damages clause should liquidate only some of the damages arising from a particular breach. But that does not mean that a different answer might not result in a different context where the presence of a liquidated damages clause is not a given.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">In this case one therefore has to start from the prior question of whether Clause 8 is a liquidated damages clause at all. On this question there are powerful indications that it is not. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The first point is that, even without considering the content of the other “damages” clauses in any detail, Clause 8 does not stand alone. It is plainly a part of a scheme. Secondly it does not say it is a liquidated damages clause. The relevant part is not even a clause on its own, or a clause directed to breach; but rather it is a part of a longer clause on payment. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Thirdly and very importantly – it applies, and interest is payable, even where there is no breach of contract. Clause 8 requires payment to be made “<span style="font-style:italic">not later than one hundred and twenty (120) days after the bill of lading date</span>”. It follows that Sonara will not be in breach if it makes payment within 120 days of the bill of lading. Nevertheless, interest runs from 31 days after the bill of lading onwards pursuant to the same clause: “<span style="font-style:italic">Ninety (90) days will bear interest at a rate equivalent to Euribor three months as published by Thomsons Reuters on the 31st day after b/l date (b/l date = day 0) + 2.60 percent</span>”. The obligation to pay interest is thus not triggered by or contingent on breach. Although a higher rate of interest is payable after 120 days (and it would therefore be conceptually possible for this interest to be liquidated damages) there is nothing in clause 8 which marks this interest out as different in kind to the interest which goes before.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Sonara also contended that an approach which concluded that Clause 8 was not a complete code was an outrage or an enormity. This is an argument which failed to gain any traction at all, particularly in circumstances where there was absolutely no evidence to suggest that the contractual interest rate was calculated (as the citation from <span style="font-style:italic">Petroleum Contracts</span> suggested) by reference to all the various losses which would be likely to eventuate arising out of late payment: and in this context loss of use of the money, incremental or penal interest charges, loss of credit rating arising out of reciprocal late payment are merely some possibilities which spring to mind. It could be perfectly possible for Clause 8 interest to represent an approximation to loss of use of money, without ever aiming to scratch the surface of other potential losses. The conclusion that Clause 8 is not a complete code of liquidated damages is only conceivably an enormity if one can conclude that it represents a genuine pre-estimate of all the losses to be covered. Yet that was not the nature of the case advanced – and that was a case which would have had to be pleaded so that evidence could be adduced.</p>

The wording in question here of <span style="font-style:italic">“directly consequential losses”</span> is at odds with the meanings generally attributed to those words in the context of damages. In the circumstances, Sahara contends that the proper interpretation of <span style="font-style:italic">“directly consequential losses”</span> is as a reference to losses which (i) have a causal connection to the relevant breach and (ii) would have been reasonably contemplated when the contract was made.  On that basis it says that the contentious claims fall within Clause 18.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Sonara has focussed upon cases dealing with indemnities in letters of indemnity or charterparties, where they form a fairly central part of the contractual scheme. Sonara’s contention is that one can see from these cases that an indemnity does not necessarily bypass the normal rules as to remoteness. It points to <span style="font-style:italic">Total Transport Corp v Arcadia Petroleum Ltd</span> (The “Eurus”) [1998] C.L.C 90 where the issue was whether the relevant clause, clause 36, permitted recovery of damage that was not within the reasonable contemplation of the parties. There Staughton LJ rejected the position that clause 36 should be construed as allowing recovery for loss that was not in the reasonable contemplation of the Parties because otherwise there would be surplusage in the wording of clause 36 concluding:</p>

I cannot extract that from the wording of the clause; and even if it were arguably there, we are now enjoined to have regard to the purpose or aim of contractual provisions as well as to the actual words used”</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">To some extent the focus on the interrelationship with remoteness puts the cart before the horse. The first issue is really to ask what this indemnity clause is doing as part of the overall contractual scheme. This is a point more nearly approached in Sonara’s Responsive Note, where it is submitted that the relevant paragraph within Clause 26 is aimed at the “<span style="font-style:italic">loss, damage, costs and expenses including legal fees</span>” that would arise from the exercise of remedies under Clause 26 (which include of course suspension and termination). Sonara also urges caution about a conclusion which would have Clause 26 as an overriding provision which takes out both Clause 8 and Clause 18.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">There is force in this argument. This is not a case where Clause 26 stands alone as a scheme for recoupment of damage or loss caused by breach.  The parties have agreed three clauses: a contractual interest clause, a damages clause and a (part) of a default clause. Simply structurally the Clause 26 indemnity does not look like an overriding provision: it is buried within Clause 26, with no signposting to it, and no cross references to the other clauses which it might affect.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Sahara is right that the wording of the clause is wide and that it is on its face apt to cover the matters claimed, even if they are not recoverable via the other clauses. However at the same time not only is the wording of the indemnity wide, but the gateway to it is at least equally wide. This is not a case of a generous remedy being available in limited circumstances. Events of default on the wording of the Contract cover not just material misrepresentations or insolvency but also (i) all failures to pay (however small the delay is) (ii) every other breach of contract (however minor) and even (iii) “<span style="font-style:italic">the seller has good reason to doubt the continuing ability or willingness of the buyer to perform its obligations hereunder</span>”. In other words, in this contract there can be an event of default even where there is no breach at all.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">It follows that if a generous reading is given to the application or breadth of the indemnity wording the result would truly cut across the contractual scheme. I am consequently persuaded that the submission of Sonara that the wording in question is not an overriding indemnity provision but rather a specific indemnity aimed at the “<span style="font-style:italic">loss, damage, costs and expenses including legal fees</span>” that would arise from the exercise of remedies under Clause 26 is correct. That conclusion arises from looking at the wording in the round, including: (i)  the role of Clause 26 overall in the contract, (ii) the structure of Clause 26 (iii) the positioning of this wording in the text, which follows on from the remedies of the seller and is placed subsidiary to a paragraph which deals with the effects of one of those remedies (suspension) and (iv) the specific reference to exercise of remedies. Essentially this wording appears to be designed to mop up losses and costs incurred in the event an event of default is declared and/or if any steps are taken under it. That is further consistent with the reference to legal costs.</p>

In this case and on the facts outlined above it is simply not possible for Sahara to overcome this hurdle. There was, on the facts, no acknowledgement of liability – even if there was (contrary to my conclusion above) an agreement to pay. Sahara obviously points to the agreement to contest the penal charges, asking “<span style="font-style:italic">why would the parties do that if Sonara did not acknowledge liability?</span>”<span style="font-style:italic">.</span> Against the background of the relationship and ongoing attempts to co-operate there could be all sorts of reasons – including (if there was an agreement – contrary to my primary finding) a settlement of a disputed claim for commercial reasons or (if there was no agreement) the hope that by the joint approach the claim could be got down to a point where Sahara was less impacted, or to a point where a settlement of a disputed liability could be reached. But the important point is that even though Sonara did agree to jointly contest the penal charges, it did make clear before, during and after the meeting that there was no agreement on liability. The inference from the joint approach is by some way less compelling than the clear words of Sonara.</p>

Sonara contends that the losses are losses stemming from breaches of single obligations to make payment, which occurred on the 120<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> day after delivery. Effectively it says that it is artificial to fragment the losses in the way suggested just because (on this hypothesis) they are pursued via an indemnity rather than as damages.

Nor is this a case like <span style="font-style:italic">The Caroline P</span> where there essentially was no liability until judgment in the proceedings, which also quantified the liability. Again none of the cases cited is purporting to lay down a principle which is generally applicable.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">In their essence the losses claimed in this case are not distinct losses at all; the losses after April 2015 are not in any way different losses from those before. Certainly when it comes to interest the essential one-ness of the claim can be seen by an examination of how the various heads of loss were separated out. In particular (i) the Incremental Interest figure is calculated by comparing the interest rate paid with the interest rate payable, and applying that to the overdue balance and (ii) it was apparent that the taking of 150 days as the start point was essentially an arbitrary - post 120 day - date. </p>

The extremely clear and helpful division of losses at Schedule 2 of the Sahara Skeleton  - although necessary for me to understand the case  - ultimately serves to highlight the artificiality of this argument. For example as to Ecobank default charges: “<span style="font-style:italic">This is the proportion of the total Ecobank charges and interest (pre-settlement) attributable to 21 April 2015 onwards as shown at H42 of the</span> “<span style="font-style:italic">Summary &amp; Time Bars” tab (i.e. 67%), multiplied by the sum claimed in respect of default charges and excess interest as pleaded…</span>”</p>

By that exchange Sonara confirmed that the remaining balance of the letter of credit had been offset against the 2013 late payment interest. In particular, the letter of 13 February 2020 records Sonara’s agreement to the proposal to offset the remaining balance of the letter of credit against the reconciled claims. Although the discharge of Sahara’s obligation is not explicitly spelled out in those letters, no other plausible construction can be given to the agreement to offset the remaining balance of the letter of credit. Sonara’s suggestion that the reference is to some different (unidentified) Standard Chartered Bank letter of credit is not credible where the match for this transaction is so precise;</p>

However, I accept Sahara’s submission that in this respect the Reconciliation Spreadsheet itself is evidence of the rates charged by Credit Suisse.  As explained by Mr Olagbami during cross-examination, the base documents used to produce the Reconciliation Spreadsheet was “<span style="font-style:italic">a combination of bank statement documents as well as bank correspondences… from the banks at the time</span>”.  The Reconciliation Spreadsheet is therefore derived from the original base information.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The main outstanding issue was whether Sahara paid the sum to Access Bank as alleged. Sahara’s case is that it paid $196,764,760.26 to Access Bank, and after various deductions the excess interest and penal charges is $21,879,529.41. Mr Good’s written opinion was that, out of the $196.8 million said to have been paid to Access Bank, Sahara has provided bank statement evidence of only $64m in relation to payments from 2019 onwards. This was a point to which repeated reference was made orally at trial and submissions were made in closing by reference to the Sahara witnesses’ (predictable) evidence that they would have expected there to be bank statements.  However, there is a difference between there having been bank statements and there being bank statements now. Further Mr Good did not seem to be opining that he had serious concerns about this, or considered there was no evidence at all. He characterised it in evidence as a “slight reservation”. Of the remaining $133m paid during 2013-2018, Mr Good accepted in cross-examination that he was “confident” in the inflows from Sahara (or at least the $104m paid during 2013-2016).  I consider that this is sufficient to establish that Sahara paid $196.8 million to Access Bank.</p>

However, what matters is what Sahara eventually paid Ecobank as a result of a final compromise settlement being made in August 2020. Sonara did not suggest in evidence the eventual Ecobank settlement was unreasonable and, in any event, this would have been an implausible suggestion to make.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Sonara pointed out the absence of factual witness evidence as to the basic underpinning of the claim: the need to convert the Euro payments to USD and if so when and at what rates. In this context a spreadsheet, however thorough, is not a substitute for underlying evidence. It is qualitatively different to the materials which were available to verify the other aspects of the claim. Then there was the question as to the impact of hedging. As to this, the November 2016 report identified some hedging gains for three relevant cargoes: 1795-07 with the comment “<span style="font-style:italic">hedge fully expired in September 2014</span>”; 1796-08 with the comment “<span style="font-style:italic">hedge done and rolled up to 29 July 2016</span>”, and 1797-09 with the comment “<span style="font-style:italic">Hedge done but rolled for the full amount of the cargo only up to November 12th, 2014 and then for 60% of the cargo up to March 27th 2015.</span>” There is no document which suggests further hedging carried out after 2016, and the case was closed on the basis of an undertaking to credit for “any” hedging; nor is there evidence as to how the existing transactions fit within a strategy, or why there should be only three such transactions when, as noted in the earlier sections, wider hedging was to be expected.  All in all, the questions are such that I would have concluded that this element of the losses was not made out.</p>
