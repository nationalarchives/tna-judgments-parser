            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">This case relates to events during a dark period for the world, when COVID-19 was spreading rapidly across the globe and governments everywhere were improvising their responses to this dreadful threat. A key element of this response was the procurement of Personal Protection Equipment ("<span style="font-weight:bold">PPE</span>") including masks.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">I shall refer to the First Claimant by its trading name, “<span style="font-weight:bold">Hitex</span>”. Hitex was a manufacturer of medical supplies in Jordan. Early in 2020 it turned to the production of medical masks. Hitex entered into a contract for the sale and purchase of masks (the “<span style="font-weight:bold">Supply Contract</span>”) with the Defendant ("<span style="font-weight:bold">Uniserve</span>") at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic in April 2020. The contract had been arranged by the Second Claimant, which I will refer to as “<span style="font-weight:bold">Caramel</span>” acting through the Third Claimant, (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Mr Popeck</span>”), who was and remains Caramel’s sole shareholder and director. These parties were to be rewarded by Uniserve by means of an introduction and supply agreement (“the <span style="font-weight:bold">Commission Contract</span>”) entered into alongside the Supply Contract.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Mr Popeck was an experienced businessman who operated principally within the fashion trade acting generally as a middleman buying from manufacturers or other wholesalers and selling to retailers. At this point he had had no experience in supplying PPE, but he was astute to the opportunity for profit caused by the soaring demand for PPE that was evident by this time. </p>

It was well connected with the UK Department of Health and Social Care (the “<span style="font-weight:bold">DHSC</span>”) and also saw the opportunity to profit by moving into the supply of PPE.</p>

There were also some recordings of telephone conversations which had been made by Dr Stead, which were also helpful as a contemporaneous record. Given Dr Stead’s evidence that he recorded all his telephone calls except when he was out of his office, it was slightly surprising that he did not disclose a greater number of relevant telephone calls. I accept his evidence that he did not record conversations when he was outside his office but given that the United Kingdom was on lockdown at this period, it is surprising that he was taking (and initiating) important calls that were not recorded.</p>

The court heard that the machine operators producing the masks also produced handwritten daily reports of the masks they have produced that day. It would have been very helpful to the court to have had these reports and it is unclear why they were not made available.</p>

I bear in mind that the passage of time can cloud or distort memory and that it is unlikely to be the case that individual witnesses will be consistently reliable or unreliable. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">This, in my view was certainly the case in the evidence before me. Mr Khader and Dr Stead each had a good recollection of the matters under consideration whilst the other witnesses were relying much more on having their memories jogged by the documentary evidence put before them, and reconstructing events on the basis of what they thought they would have done. Mr Popeck underwent major surgery for a heart condition during the period in question, which may have affected his memory. Mr Liddell at this time was dealing with a very large number of contracts (he suggested in cross-examination that he was dealing with 300 vendors from over 500 factories and managed over 15,000 purchase orders, in addition to the Supply Contract), so it is unlikely he would have had as great a grasp of the events in question as some of the other witnesses for whom the Supply Contract would have loomed larger in their minds. </p>

Mr Popeck originally made enquiries of a friend and colleague in Istanbul called Mr Ibrahim Tetik to explore the possibility of sourcing PPE from Turkey. Mr Tetik introduced Mr Popeck to Mr Alsakka, a friend of Mr Tetik based in Dubai. </p>

Mr Popeck was extremely interested to do business with a manufacturer in Jordan and asked Mr Alsakka to inspect the factory. In reliance on favourable reports from Mr Alsakka, Mr Popeck agreed to pay Hitex $500,000 (or possibly a higher sum - the evidence on this is not entirely consistent) to “block-book” production. It seems that this arrangement was a very informal one, with no written agreement and no specific agreement relating to dates, quantities, or prices. Mr Popeck gave evidence that this was not unusual for him to deal in such an informal manner when an opportunity presented itself that needed to be dealt with quickly. </p>

Having block-booked production, Mr Popeck regarded himself as the person who would decide where Hitex’s production would be sold. He originally wanted to act as a reseller of the production to Uniserve and was persuaded only reluctantly to the arrangements that were finally entered into whereby Uniserve would contract directly with Hitex and he would receive a commission through the Commission Contract, rather than making a profit as a reseller.</p>

This is that Maxitrac, through Dr Stead, was instrumental in introducing Hitex to Uniserve. Perhaps the two statements can be reconciled if Mr Liddell knew of Mr Waller but did not know which supplier Mr Waller was seeking to introduce and it was Dr Stead that found out about Hitex through Mr Waller. This is speculation but happily this is not a point I need to determine. </p>

Any information originally received from Hitex would pass through a number of intermediate communicators – including Mr Alsakka, possibly Mr Tetik, Mr Popeck, Mr Waller, and Dr Stead before it reached Uniserve. This point is relevant when we come to consider the misrepresentation claim. </p>

In my view the best interpretation at this stage was that Mr Popeck/Caramel was acting on his/its own behalf and not as an agent of Hitex. Mr Popeck, under the Supply Contract, once it was signed, would become authorised to deal on behalf of Hitex, but until that point, there is no reason to consider that when Mr Popeck spoke he was making representations on behalf of Hitex. If he was not authorised to make representations on behalf of Hitex, then neither was Mr Waller.</p>

Whilst in his witness statement Mr Popeck said that the information given to Mr Waller was based on information from Mr Alsakka, he agreed in cross-examination that only a week later he was asking Mr Alsakka for a delivery schedule and that “on balance” it was correct that on 12 April he did not know how many masks could be delivered by Hitex in Jordan and did not know when any deliveries could be made. </p>

For example, it is quite possible that there had been discussions of the capabilities of the new automatic mask machines that were on order, and that an originally carefully worded message explaining what production capacities were going to be, assuming that machines arrived when they were expected to, became oversimplified as it was transmitted from one person to another into a bald statement as to when supply would become available.</p>

There is no evidence that Mr Waller was authorised by Hitex to make any representation. There is no evidence that Hitex directed the information in the Waller Email to be sent to Uniserve via Mr Popeck or Mr Waller or anyone else and, even if Hitex was the source of the figures, it is highly unlikely that these were presented by Hitex in the form of an representation intended to induce a buyer to enter into a contract. It is also unlikely that Hitex would have provided these figures without explaining that the ability to meet the figures would depend on the expected future, rather than the present, rate of production. I conclude that there is no evidence that the statements in the Waller Email were statements by Hitex. </p>

              <p class="Citations" style="margin-left:0.79in">"First, in order to sustain an action of deceit, there must be proof of fraud, and nothing short of that will suffice. Secondly, fraud is proved when it is shewn that a false representation has been made (1) knowingly, or (2) without belief in its truth, or (3) recklessly, careless whether it be true or false. Although I have treated the second and third as distinct cases, I think the third is but an instance of the second, for one who makes a statement under such circumstances can have no real belief in the truth of what he states. To prevent a false statement being fraudulent, there must, I think, always be an honest belief in its truth. And this probably covers the whole ground, for one who knowingly alleges that which is false, has obviously no such honest belief. Thirdly, if fraud be proved, the motive of the person guilty of it is immaterial. It matters not that there was no intention to cheat or injure the person to whom the statement was made."</p>

No doubt that Hitex would have been aware generally about negotiations for the contract centring around quantities and delivery dates similar to those in the Waller Email, but that is different to saying that Hitex was aware that positive representations had been put forward as to its capacity to meet those requirements with a view to inducing the contract (even if the Waller Email can be regarded as including such positive representations, which, as I explain below, I do not consider to be the case).</p>

Mr Khader's evidence was that the machines were being operated 22 hours a day. At the expected rate of production, the new machine by itself was anticipated to have produced somewhere between 100 to 120 masks per minute. Over 22 hours (assuming no stoppage or production issues) therefore it could produce somewhere between 132,000 and 158,400 masks a day plus whatever the semi-automated machine could produce. I do not think we were informed as to the daily capacity of the semiautomated machine. The best indication we have is what Majlan was told when it visited the factory – around 20,000 per day. </p>

Certainly, forming such a belief would have required Hitex to have an optimistic outlook, but if it had made a statement reflecting such a belief, I do not think that the statement could be characterised as being without any basis or that these facts demonstrate that Hitex must have been reckless as to whether the statement was true or false. </p>

At the rate of production allowed by one automatic machine and the existing semi-automated machine it would not be possible to make enough additional masks to supply an additional 5 million masks on 22 April. Mr Khader confirmed in his witness statement that production was not expected to get up to the level of 5 million a week during April. </p>

It is possible that they were cavalier about the figures quoted. It is also possible that they did on the basis of a misunderstanding of information indirectly relayed to them (or information that became out of date when it transpired that the new machines were not going to be delivered on time). I think that it is likely that they would have understood that reaching full production capacities depended on the installation of machines not yet received, but they may not have been kept up to date with the expected delivery dates for the machines and may have based expectations on earlier information about this. </p>

One cannot confirm a statement that 5 million masks will be available on a particular date by making a different statement that 5 million, or 6 million masks can be delivered on a different date. As we have seen, Uniserve's case is not based on its reliance on these further statements. Uniserve's case is that it relied on the Waller Email and that there were further representations repeating or reaffirming the Waller Email. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">On 15 April 2020 Mr Bonnett provided instructions to Majlan asking them to check a number of matters including current volume of production per day/week; whether Hitex could manage the order currently or whether the new machine was essential to fulfilling the order volume. In a later email the same day, Majlan were given further instructions (following suggestions from Dr Stead) including instructions to take pictures of the production line; pictures of the storage bays and of stacked masks ready to ship; to ask the production line managers how many masks can be made on this machine per day; to ask casually "<span style="font-style:italic">so this is where you will make 10,000,000 masks a week?</span>". </p>

Majlan reported back to the effect that the current volume of production was 25,000 masks per day on the semi-automated machine and 80,000 masks per day on the fully-automated machine and that they expected to increase the production line to four automated machines, and that some of these machines were in customs and some of them in shipping and will arrive soon. Mr Bonnett passed this email to Mr Liddell and also reported that once a new machine is installed early next week it would take production to approximately 180,000 per day so "<span style="font-style:italic">maybe 1 million a week</span>". He noted that he understood this to be shy of Uniserve's expectations. </p>

It was sufficient that the false claim influenced the insurer in the sum offered in settlement. Lord Clarke said that even in a case in which the claimant knows that the representation was a lie, the claimant “<span style="font-style:italic">may be able to establish inducement on the facts</span>”. No doubt Lord Clarke is correct in this, but the cases where someone is induced by a statement that is known or believed by that person to be false are likely to be few. </p>

It is fanciful to believe that Uniserve was still relying on these in preference to its own due diligence which clearly contradicted these statements. The circumstances are similar to those in <span style="font-style:italic">Hartlelid v Sawyer &amp; McClockin Real Estate Ltd</span> [1977] 5 W.W.R. 481, mentioned in <span style="font-style:italic">Chitty on Contracts</span> (35<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> Edition) at 10-042.

I do not see, however, how this point advances Uniserve's case. Uniserve could not at the same time believe that the statements in the Waller Email would prove true and that the information it received from Majlan was true. It would have to decide whether it relied on one or the other. There can be no doubt that it would rely on its own investigations in preference to a prediction made some three weeks earlier by the agent of a middleman who was seeking to put the deal together. </p>

It seems, however, that the volumes in that contract were not initially tied down. Whilst Mr Liddell's oral evidence was that he thought that there would have been a schedule of delivery amounts and times attached to the contract with DHSC, I do not think this was correct. The contract does not mention any such schedule, it just states delivery dates "TBC". Uniserve, therefore might reasonably be expected to have considered tying down the Supply Contract was in its interest even if it believed that the masks were likely to be supplied later than on the dates originally promised in the Waller Email or in the Supply Contract and knew that the delivery of the masks was dependent on new machines arriving since at this stage it had not committed to DHSC in relation to a particular delivery schedule. </p>

I think Mr Walsh may have later withdrawn this suggestion, but for the record I will confirm my ruling that this is not a good argument. The fact that the Supply Contract set out dates for delivery cannot be regarded as a repetition of a <span style="font-style:italic">representation</span> as to production capacity. In any case, the dates for delivery in the Supply Contract were not the same as those mentioned in the Waller Email, although there was some overlap in that 5 million masks a week were being contracted for as from 5 May.</p>

As this was a contract that had been produced by Uniserve, and there was, in my view, no inequality between the parties, and as entire agreement provisions of this type are entirely normal in commercial contracts and serve a useful purpose, I do not think that any such argument can be sustained. </p>

First, Uniserve has not demonstrated that the pleaded misrepresentation was one made by Hitex, rather than by Mr Waller or by Mr Popeck. Secondly, Uniserve has not established that, to the extent that the Waller Email was based on any statement made on behalf of Hitex, that the statement was made with a view to inducing the contract with Uniserve, rather than a mere expected indication of capacities as a basis for negotiations. Thirdly it is entirely clear that the statement was not in fact relied upon by Uniserve.</p>

In my view, as explained above, the same is true in relation to the s.2(1) MA 1967 claim. But even if this is wrong, Uniserve was never going to get anywhere with a claim under s.2(1) MA 1967 as this is validly precluded under the entire agreement clause contained in the Supply Contract.</p>

The draft contract was sent to Mr Popeck and Mr Liddell on 21 April. On 22 April Mr Popeck wrote to Dr Stead with a revised schedule, asking for the contract to be returned with the revised quantities and promising that Hitex would immediately sign and return the contract once it was amended with the revised numbers. I could not find in the bundle a copy of the counterpart of the agreement signed on behalf of Uniserve, but I note that the contract signed on behalf of Uniserve was sent by Dr Stead to Mr Alsakka on 24 April at 11:07 am. The Commission Contract was sent by Dr Stead to Mr Popeck on 24 April at 10:44 am. This was signed by Mr Bruce Chaplin, the finance director of Uniserve. As with the Supply Contract, the agreement was dated 21 April 2020. It was Mr Liddell's oral evidence that Uniserve had signed the agreement on 21 April, but as he probably was not the signatory, and his recollection of events seems to have been reconstructed rather than a distinct memory of these events, I will prefer the documentary record to Mr Liddell's recollection. I find that the contract was not exchanged until 24 April, and certainly that Uniserve did not commit itself to the contract until after the inspection that Majlan carried out on its behalf on 23 April.</p>

Secondly, the attached report from Bureau Veritas also includes such a photograph. Thirdly, whilst standard EN 14683:2019 does describe a nose bridge as being optional, it is a requirement of the standard that the mask must have a means by which it can be fitted closely over the nose, mouth and chin of the wearer, and it is difficult to see how masks of the type and shape being offered here could fit securely around the nose without a nose bridge.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">There is a possible argument that Hitex was deliberately misleading Uniserve by producing the Bureau Veritas report if it intended to produce masks without nose bridges. Mr Khader explained that this was not the case. The purpose of the report was to demonstrate that the material and construction of masks met the relevant standard and that the reason why Bureau Veritas had been provided with a mask with a nose bridge was because the report was produced for special masks ordered from Azerbaijan where nose bridges had been specified and the test mask had been made especially for this. That contract, however, was not proceeded with. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">I have some doubts about this explanation, especially as Hitex had produced a flyer for general circulation describing its mask product which included a description that it had a nose bridge (although I have not established when this was in circulation- it may date from the time when masks with nose bridges were being produced). Nevertheless, given that Hitex was purchasing from China machines that were capable of producing nose bridges, but initially did not set up the machines to do so, despite these doubts I conclude that on the balance of probabilities Hitex did consider a nose bridge to be optional and did not realise that the specification in the Supply Contract should be read as including a requirement for nose bridges.</p>

However, two or three days before the first shipment was due, he was informed by Mr Alsakka that Uniserve required a product with nose bridges. The masks that had been already produced (or the vast majority of them) did not have nose bridges and therefore Mr Khader's confidence, although I am satisfied it was genuinely held at the time, proved to be misplaced.</p>

Mr Khader explained to Mr Alsakka that it would take somewhere between 10 days and two weeks to recalibrate the machines to produce nose bridges. Mr Alsakka said that he would speak to Uniserve about a new timetable. He later came back to say that this would be acceptable, but that Hitex needed to start immediately implementing the change in the production. </p>

Only a few weeks later there is an email exchange between Mr Liddell and Dr Stead, where they were discussing abandoning the contract with Hitex in favour of a new Chinese supplier. Mr Liddell asks Dr Stead how they can get out of the Supply Contract. Dr Stead indicates that they should wait to see how Hitex get on in meeting the Revised Schedule. It is telling that neither of them raises the point that there is no need to do this as Hitex were still contractually obliged to meet the original schedule and by this time Hitex was hopelessly behind on delivering to that schedule. </p>

As it appeared that Maxitrac and Uniserve were working together with a view to profit and were sharing profits and costs, I put to the parties the question whether Maxitrac and Uniserve were in fact in partnership together. Each of the parties agreed that it was not their case that there was any partnership, and I was later pointed to a provision in the (later) Maxitrac Contract which stated in terms that:</p>

Other people who see him acting as managing director are entitled to assume that he has the usual authority of a managing director. But sometimes ostensible authority exceeds actual authority. For instance, when the board appoint the managing director, they may expressly limit his authority by saying he is not to order goods worth more than £500 without the sanction of the board.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The latter case is a 1909 case in the High Court of Australia. It related to a mortgage taken out under a power of attorney made by a property owner in favour of his wife. At the time the power of attorney was created the putative mortgagor was insane. After the attorney's husband had recovered his sanity, he accepted the benefits of the mortgage in the form of advances from the Bank made in reliance on the mortgage. The court accepted that a contract made by a "lunatic" (using the language of the time) was not void but may become binding upon him if by his subsequent conduct he precludes himself from denying its validity. Griffith CJ outlined a doctrine of equitable estoppel that arises from "<span style="font-style:italic">the mere fact of acceptance and retention of the benefit arising from the acts of the person assuming to act as agent</span>". This doctrine, in the opinion of the court extended to "<span style="font-style:italic">all cases of assumed agency in which the necessary conditions exist</span>".

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">It follows therefore, that the Supply Contract envisaged that there may be changes to the delivery timescales or delivery instructions that would be agreed in writing. It is perhaps a question of semantics as to whether such an agreement in writing should be regarded as a variation of the Supply Contract, or as operating a mechanism under the Supply Contract, but certainly, the fact that this was envisaged in this way suggests that variations to these matters were regarded under the Supply Contract as a matter of contract management and therefore was within the scope of Maxitrac which was, undeniably, undertaking contract management on behalf of Uniserve.</p>

Uniserve produced an Amended and Re-amended Defence, and the Claimants argue that this superseded or replaced the original response and contained no specific pleading as to the effect of clause 17.2. Neither was this point included in the agreed list of issues prepared for the Case Management Conference. The Claimants therefore look to treat the point as having been abandoned.</p>

Without repeating that analysis in full here, I agree that there is no reason to believe that the "authorised representative" mentioned (without capitals) in clause 17.2 of the Supply Contract should be limited to the individuals who were named as (with capitals) the "Uniserve Authorised Representative(s)" and as the "Supplier's Authorised Representative(s)".</p>

In addition to confirming the principle enunciated by Denning LJ set out above, this considered the position where, in a contract where time was of the essence in relation to a purchaser's obligation to provide a letter of credit, the seller provided a fixed extension of time to meet this requirement, but the requirement was not met within that period. In response to an argument by the purchaser that the fixed extension of time was not of reasonable length, Kerr LJ, found that:</p>

Brook LJ noted that in certain circumstances, a court may be entitled to draw adverse inferences from the absence, or the silence, of a witness who might be expected to have material evidence to give on an issue in that action and that may go to strengthen the evidence adduced on that issue by the other party, or to weaken the evidence, if any, adduced by the party who might reasonably have been expected to call the witness. However, there must have been some evidence, however weak, adduced by the former on the matter in question before the court is entitled to draw the desired inference: in other words, there must be a case to answer on that issue. If the reason for the witness’s absence or silence satisfies the court, then no such adverse inference may be drawn. If, on the other hand, there is some credible explanation given, even if it is not wholly satisfactory, the potentially detrimental effect of his or her absence or silence may be reduced or nullified. </p>

This was a case regarding unfair dismissal and largely turned on the question of who had the burden of proof under the relevant employment legislation, however there was also a question about whether any adverse inference should be drawn from the fact that in the employment tribunal Royal Mail did not adduce evidence for anyone who had been responsible for rejecting any of the claimant's job applications. Lord Leggett JSC made comments about the approach that an employment tribunal should take in drawing an adverse inference from the fact that a relevant witness to a key point has not been called, but I do not think I can assume that these comments apply the same way to proceedings in the High Court.</p>

Technically delivery is not completed according to the terms of the Supply Contract until Uniserve collects the Goods. It would be a nonsense, however, if Uniserve could put Hitex into breach by failing to perform its side of contract. Hitex's responsibility under the Supply Contract was limited to having the goods available for collection on (or by) the agreed dates (which should now be taken as those agreed in the Revised Schedule).</p>

For the reasons stated above, I do not consider that the Majlan email of 15 June provided that cogent evidence.</p>

His tone was at times verging on belligerent, sometimes cutting across what Mr Khader was saying. I consider that he was trying to use the call to obtain an admission from Mr Khader that Hitex was behind with deliveries. Mr Khader was polite, and naturally was not wishing to antagonise the representative of Hitex's most important customer, so that it cannot be assumed that his failure to correct Dr Stead at any point necessarily meant he was agreeing with what Dr Stead was saying, although, clearly, he was willing to disagree with Dr Stead at points. As the conversation moved on Mr Khader could see the direction the conversation was taking and became alarmed. </p>

They both understood that the dates under the Revised Schedule were dates by which the goods needed to be ready for delivery. Dr Stead was focusing on that as constituting Hitex's obligation under the Supply Contract. Mr Khader, by contrast, was concentrating on the practicalities of actual delivery (which would only occur when Majlan, on behalf of Uniserve, collected the goods). This explains why Mr Khader was expecting "delivery" to occur in the week after 14 June.</p>

This discussion also seemed confused as Dr Stead seemed to be conflating delivery (i.e. collection by the shipping agent) with Hitex's obligation to have numbers of masks available on particular dates according to the Revised Schedule. Mr Khader reminds Dr Stead that the contract is ex-works and that Hitex is not responsible for shipping.</p>

Mr Khader's answer at [320] could, especially as originally transcribed, be construed as an acceptance that 2 million masks had not been manufactured on 14 June. However, as I have transcribed it, that is still a possible interpretation, but there is another interpretation that the first sentence confirms that the manufacturing of 2 million masks has been done and then goes on to explain what is being done about the delivery of these masks. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">In summary, in my view Dr Stead was clearly trying to get Mr Khader to admit a failure to meet the Revised Schedule, he had in effect ambushed Mr Khader and continually pressed him in a hectoring tone for an admission. Despite this he obtained nothing that can be relied upon as a clear admission of a breach of the Revised Schedule by Hitex as at the date of that call. During the call Mr Khader denied several times that there had been a breach. There were various points which might be taken as an admission by Mr Khader that 2 million masks were not available on 14 June, but none of these were clear, and I must take account of the fact that Mr Khader was on the back foot without having all the evidence in front of him. The parties clearly were at times at cross purposes as to whether they were discussing manufacturing or collection. Against this background, I do not think I can place much if any reliance on the conversation as evidencing that a breach had occurred by the date of the call.</p>

However, without having tested this point in that way, Uniserve cannot demonstrate that masks that were shown as available in the Production Reports were not in fact available to it. Hitex might have dealt with the requirements of other customers and of the Government of Jordan out of the reduction in the number of masks in the warehouse that we see in the table above between 31 May and 7 June. Hitex anyway might have preferred to let down other customers rather than its biggest customer, Uniserve. If Uniserve's case is that Hitex could never have met the contract because its stock was being requisitioned by the Government of Jordan, it has not done enough to establish that case. </p>

It amounts to hearsay evidence from a person that could have been called and was not called together with conclusions drawn from an unofficial recording of a confused and confusing telephone call between Dr Stead and an unprepared Mr Khader where Mr Khader was clearly attempting to obtain a clear admission of failure to meet the Revised Schedule but fell short of achieving that. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The evidence that the Revised Schedule was being met derives from Production Records that appear to be contemporaneous, and which have not been shown to have been falsified. Whilst the Production Records may have understated stock, as they took no account of stock that have not been moved into the main warehouse, and whilst they took no account of any stock that might need to be reserved to meet the requirements of another party, they remain the best records available. </p>

If Uniserve was unable to take the goods as a result of constraints on transport, it could at least have sent a representative to check that the goods were available. If it wanted to rely on the goods not being available in order to terminate the Supply Contract, once it suited it to do so, it should have done this. In the absence of it doing so it cannot be surprised that the court will prefer the Claimants' documentary records to the far less solid grounds it has provided for believing that there was a problem.</p>

If this was a breach, however, it was not a repudiatory breach. Whilst time was of the essence in relation to Hitex's performance, it was not in relation to Uniserve's performance. It would have taken a notice from Hitex that performance was required by a particular date, to elevate this breach into one entitling Hitex to terminate of the Supply Contract.</p>

At about that date, or shortly afterwards, Majlan was instructed to have no further dealings with Hitex, and the Claimants would have concluded at that point that Uniserve had no intention of further performing the Supply Contract or the Commission Contract. In legal terms this amounted to an anticipatory breach. It was clear that Uniserve would not perform its obligations to accept delivery of masks and/or to pay for them in accordance with the Supply Contract. These obligations went to the core of those contracts and must be regarded as conditions of the Supply Contract so that this anticipatory breach would give rise to a right to Hitex to terminate the Supply Contract. </p>

Probably on 17 June, but certainly by 11 July, Hitex would have been (and I think it is established by internal emails was) in no doubt that Uniserve was purporting to treat the Supply Contract as being at an end as a result of Hitex's alleged failure to make timely supplies.

This renunciation amounted to an anticipatory breach by Uniserve.</p>

They argue that Uniserve's failure to collect is to be taken as an implied request by Uniserve to postpone delivery of the goods by instalment. Their argument is that as no period of instalment was stipulated, Uniserve could have given notice to Hitex fixing a reasonable time thereafter within which the goods were to be delivered or accepted, but Hitex could not be compelled to deliver at one time the whole quantity of the goods which, but for the postponement, should have been delivered in the period of postponement. </p>

This describes a distinction that is made between different ways in which a contract for the supply of goods by instalments may be interpreted. In some cases, a contract may be regarded as an entire and indivisible contract for the delivery of the quantity of goods stated in it. In other cases (said to be more often) contracts for the delivery of goods by instalments will more often be construed as severable (or divisible) contracts than as entire. Here, performance by each party of his obligations may be severable, in the sense that a breach relating to one or more instalments must be considered in the light of its effect on the contract as a whole, so that the innocent party will not necessarily be entitled to treat the whole contract as repudiated by such a breach. </p>

It could only give rise to a right of termination if Hitex served a notice giving Uniserve a reasonable time to meet its obligation to accept the goods and providing that Hitex would treat as a breach of the contract a failure to perform its obligation within that reasonable time. </p>

This related to a contract for the delivery of 6000 to 8000 tons of coal to be delivered into the plaintiff's' wagons at the defendants' collieries in equal monthly quantities over a period of 12 months. Immediately after the first month the defendants informed the plaintiffs that, as the plaintiffs had taken only 158 tons, the defendants would annul the contract. This contract did not deal with the question of retender. It is better thought of as an early example of the court considering whether in a contract for the sale of goods to be delivered by instalments, failure to meet obligations in relation to one instalment amounted to a repudiatory breach which could be accepted by the other party to bring about the termination of the contract. </p>

The case turned on what the supplier needed to do to meet its contractual obligation to provide an average rate. The court decided that this matter was to be determined by an arbitrator. If this case has any relevance at all to our present circumstances, I think it relates to the approach the court took in assuming (I think correctly) that the measure of damages would need to be calculated by reference to the coal price at a particular date, and therefore it was necessary to work out the date on which the contract had been breached.

I see nothing in the Supply Contract that suggests that if Uniserve fails to collect a delivery on time, and then turns up later to collect that delivery and a subsequent delivery that is then due, Hitex can provide the subsequent delivery using the stock it had manufactured for the first delivery and should be given extra time to manufacture further stock to meet the second delivery.</p>

The pressure was alleviated by sending Mr Popeck 2 million masks (which Mr Khader believes was before the end of July). This was done in repayment of loans (or perhaps advance payments) made by Mr Popeck to Hitex. According to Mr Popeck, the masks were treated between Hitex and Mr Popeck as having a value of $300,000, but Mr Popeck was able to sell only some of the masks at a price of $0.04 or $0.05 per mask which was just enough to cover Mr Popeck's storage charges. Of the remaining masks he retained 5% for the use of himself, family and friends and gave the rest to charity.</p>

Hitex made some sales in the local market. According to Mr Khader, Hitex could have met these sales as well as of the Supply Contract and could have increased production at any time. Efforts were also made to contact previous clients to sell masks there. Mr Khader's evidence was that towards the end of July Hitex made hundreds of calls to the people who were trying to communicate with Hitex between April and May.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">In my view, however, the better view is that in the current case one should look at the nature of the breach that gave rise to termination. Uniserve's renunciation of the contract created an anticipatory breach which brought the entirety of the contract at an end from the point that this breach was accepted (which I have found to be 13 July). At that point Hitex lost the benefit of a secure contract to supply the remaining 77 million masks not already accepted by Uniserve. It is that loss of bargain that constitutes the loss "<span style="font-style:italic">directly and naturally resulting … from the buyer's breach of contract</span>" (to use the language of subsection 50(2)). Hitex's loss (which at root is its loss of bargain) should be considered by reference to the market as at the date of that breach for a contract to purchase masks for forward delivery on the dates provided for in the Revised Schedule – i.e. the market for 77 million masks to be delivered on a schedule as similar as possible to the Revised Schedule.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">I reach this view on the basis that I consider that subsection 50(2) is the overarching test of how damages should be calculated. In applying that test, one should look at the actual loss to the seller, which for Hitex is the loss of a bargain to sell the remaining 77 million masks at the price set out in the Supply Contract for delivery by the dates set out in the Supply Contract. As I have discussed above, the Supply Contract should be viewed as an entire contract. Accordingly, the loss occasioned by Uniserve's unjustified renunciation of the contract should be measured by reference to the entire contract.  Subsection 50(3) exists to provide a useful clarification that were there is a market one should take the market or current price (rather than, for example, a price at which the seller actually chose to deal). It provides a <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> rule of thumb for applying subsection 50(2). It is only a <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> test and therefore clearly is not intended to overrule that subsection if its literal application would result in the seller receiving something different to the loss directly and naturally resulting from the buyer's breach.</p>

If there was no market for a single contract of 77 million masks delivered over the term of the Revised Schedule, but there was a market at or after each point at which a delivery was due under the Revised Schedule for the number of masks to be delivered on that date, (including the backlog that was due to have been taken by 13 July), the price that could have been achieved on those dates, would nevertheless be relevant in fixing Uniserve's liability. </p>

This surge in demand was largely met by greater imports from the People's Republic of China (hereafter "China"). However, this was short lived; demand for imports of facemasks fell dramatically after the initial spike and sources of imports since diversified rapidly. In this instance, international trade and global supply chains enable countries to mitigate temporary supply constraints for essential goods in the face of surges of demand."</p>

The testing and certification requirements, and in some cases requirements to partner with a locally authorised intermediary, and the practical difficulties of gaining access to procurement channels meant that it would have been difficult and time-consuming to sell the products in a country with a centralised document process. Whilst it may have been procedurally more straightforward to sell the masks piecemeal to multiple customers in different countries, this would also have been difficult, time-consuming, and costly as Hitex would have had to negotiate the different testing and accreditation requirements, pricing and delivery terms with each customer individually, and establish a distribution network for each country. If Hitex have been able to find alternative customers, these would have been sold at a considerably lower price than was agreed with Uniserve.</p>

He did not consider in any detail whether there were wholesalers who were supplying the retail market, although he did note that Hitex would be at a competitive disadvantage in selling its medical grade masks to the retail market as it would be competing with cheaper alternative face coverings. </p>

As a result, the price to buy facemasks was particularly high from February 2020 until about June 2020 owing to the stock available not meeting demand. She did not consider, however, that the market collapsed after June 2020. She noted that from 15 June 2020 became mandatory to wear face coverings in UK public spaces and this added to the demand for masks. I must be cautious about this point, however, as Mr Trainor points out this was a demand for masks in general and not for Type IIR medical grade masks. </p>

According to this report NHS NSS awarded 78 contracts worth £340 million to companies providing PPE between March 2020 and June 2021.

The price per facemasks started to drop but, in her view, certainly did not collapse and there remained, in her view, a market for the sale and purchase of facemasks. She makes the point that the UK government had to discard billions of items of PPE that had turned out to be substandard. From late June to August 2020 the UK government began buying directly from manufacturers.</p>

There was no public register where all transactions were recorded and, accordingly, participants had little visibility regarding the fair price for masks at any given point. Nevertheless, she felt able to opine that a market existed into which Hitex could have sold facemasks during the relevant period. She felt able to provide a view about what price Hitex could have achieved had it sold into the market being:</p>

The price per mask was not disclosed. The press release dated 16 November dealing with that order also stated that there were a number of other local firms nearing completion of the assessment process and, if successful, they too will begin production of Type IIR masks in the coming weeks.

Mr Trainor dismissed the possibility of sales other than to government purchasers, whilst a retail market clearly did exist for masks and there must have been wholesalers supplying that market that Hitex might have been able to deal with, even if this meant pricing the masks at a price that would be competitive with non-medical grade masks. Ms Corbett did not address the issues of accreditation and preference for local suppliers that a Jordanian company might encounter in supplying into another country. Neither was the evidence that she adduced on price particularly relevant to the volumes of masks that Hitex needed to sell.</p>

Whilst by the end of July I consider that the public sector demand for masks had been substantially sated I consider that it would have been possible for Hitex to sell masks during that period had it accessed appropriately connected wholesalers. It would have been possible to sell to wholesalers accessing retail markets, albeit at a price that would need to be competitive with non-medical grade masks. There was probably also still an ability to sell to public sector buyers across the world, but only after meeting accreditation requirements, which would have delayed the sales and would have caused them to be made during a period when supply was greatly outstripping demand.</p>

The contract is clear at clause 6.1 that the Commission Contract itself does not create an obligation to buy any masks and the provisions for payment only once masks have cleared customs reinforce this point. It is clear that Uniserve was only willing to make a payment of commission if it received the masks in the United Kingdom so that it could supply them to its purchaser and make profit. The position is analogous to that of an estate agent who agrees to accept a commission from the seller on completion of the sale. One would not imply into such an agreement a condition that the seller, having agreed a sale, must pay the commission even if the sale does not proceed to completion.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The first is that Maxitrac and/or Dr Stead were in breach of duties to Uniserve in agreeing the Revised Schedule. This is included on the basis that Uniserve did not confer any authority to amend the terms of the Supply Contract so that any consequent liability that Uniserve may have to Hitex for breach of the Supply Contract was caused by Maxitrac/Dr Stead exceeding its/his authority.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The short answer to this claim is that I have found that Dr Stead was given express authority by Mr Liddell to sort out the Supply Contract. He understood this to encompass authority to agree the Revised Schedule. I consider he was reasonable in interpreting his instructions this way. Accordingly, he/Maxitrac were not acting outside their authority. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Furthermore, even if they were acting outside their authority, the Revised Schedule was quickly brought to the attention of Uniserve. Mr Bonnett, Mr Chaplin, and Mr Liddell were all aware of it. If they had not intended to agree it, they could have immediately drawn Dr Stead's attention, and indeed the attention of Hitex, to the point that this was not agreed and/or was agreed but without waiver of any rights for breach of the original schedule. They failed to do this and thereby allowed Hitex to operate on the basis that Uniserve would accept performance according to the Revised Schedule knowing that Hitex would rely on this representation. This had the effect of either ratifying Dr Stead's agreement of the Revised Schedule, or at the very least of creating an estoppel, effectively preventing them from denying the agreement of the Revised Schedule later.</p>

Dr Stead was doing what he was asked to do, Uniserve raised no objection to this at the time and has no case that it has suffered loss through Maxitrac or Dr Stead acting contrary to its wishes. If Uniserve had wanted a different outcome it would have said so at the time. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The first, and most fundamental, is that I have found that at the time that Uniserve states that it had instructed Maxitrac/Dr Stead terminate the Supply Contract Uniserve had no right to terminate the agreement as it had not established a breach of the Revised Schedule.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The second reason is that Uniserve has not been able to demonstrate that there was a clear instruction for Dr Stead to claim a breach. The only instructions pointed to were telephone calls that were at best ambiguous. In the context that the Supply Contract contained a specific means of terminating the contract which was for Uniserve, rather than any agent of Uniserve to undertake, and against the further background that when termination had been discussed earlier Dr Stead had drafted a notice for Uniserve to send, it is difficult to believe that the ambiguous telephone call where Mr Liddell said that "it's over" and indicated that he had terminated the agreement should be construed by Dr Stead as an instruction for Maxitrac to do so. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Furthermore, if the complaint is that Dr Stead failed to pass on the information that Uniserve was treating the contract as at an end through Hitex's breach, in my view there is nothing in that complaint, since that is precisely what Dr Stead did. If Hitex had been in breach at this point, then Dr Stead's communications to Mr Khader and Mr Popeck would have been effective to convey the point that Uniserve was treating the contract at an end as a result of Hitex' breach. Uniserve's loss does not derive from his (or Maxitrac acting through him) failing to convey this. It arises from the fact that Uniserve had jumped the gun and was treating the contract as over without first having established any reasonable cause to believe that Hitex was in breach.</p>

The truth was that they accepted the Revised Schedule as the best solution available. As regards the allegation that Maxitrac/Dr Stead failed to communicate the termination of the Supply Contract, the fact that Dr Stead's communications failed to bring about a termination for breach on the part of Hitex had nothing to do with Dr Stead's failure to communicate to Hitex that Uniserve was treating the Supply Contract as being at an end, and everything to do with the fact that Uniserve had failed to demonstrate a breach. </p>
