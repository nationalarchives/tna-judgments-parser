The express way of this occurring is of course for the defendant to plead not guilty. But the guidance refers to the court setting a trial date as being a way of marking the possibility that a trial will go ahead.

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">There are two situations in which a cracked trial fee will be due under Schedule 2 to the 2013 Regulations. The first requires, before any other condition is met, that the assisted person enters a plea of not guilty to one or more counts at the first hearing at which he or she enters a plea. It has no application to this case.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The second is that a case is listed for trial without a hearing at which the assisted person enters a plea. This could be read in one of two ways: that there is no hearing at which the assisted person enters a plea, or that there is such a hearing, but the case is listed for trial before it takes place.</p>
