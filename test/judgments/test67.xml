Operators are required to provide four specified values of data with regard to cash fares, daily tickets and weekly tickets to be used to estimate the average cash fare paid by commercial passengers for each journey, and the average price per ticket of daily and weekly tickets respectively (paragraph 4 of Schedule 3). Paragraph 5.1 of Schedule 3 then provides that the four values are to be input into a spreadsheet which draws on the data included in the DfT model or other local data if more applicable (<span style="font-style:italic">“the Look-up table”</span>) to populate a DfT Discount Factor calculation. Paragraph 5.1 provides that the specific values in the Look-up table are locally derived from all smart card concessionary journeys originating in the Principal Area over a representative time period.

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is Diamond’s case that the Look-up table used by TfWM is unrepresentative and does not represent the typicality of travel of passengers travelling on the buses of Diamond. In particular, it is Diamond’s case that the dominance of National Express as an operator in the Principal Area (where it operates 90% of all services) means that the Look-up table formulated by TfWM is skewed out of favour to Diamond and that, in consequence, it results in a substantial under calculation in the level of fare income that Diamond has foregone in consequence of the Arrangements. In the course of submission Mr Connolly further explained this skewing as resulting from the fact that it is Diamond’s case that passengers using National Express are likely to use more discounted, i.e., daily and weekly, tickets than passengers using Diamond’s services. Consequently, it is Diamond’s case that if the Look-up table is prepared using data from all operators across the Principal Area, this is bound to result in a lower Average Fare than if one had simply considered Diamond’s own fares. This is because the Discount Factor applied is based upon a consideration of the data from all operators across the Principal Area and will, it said, therefore be greater than if based simply upon a consideration of data relating to Diamond’s passengers and fares because fewer of Diamond’s fares are discounted than the average (of which National Express represents 90%).</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Diamond relies upon the considerations referred to in paragraph 16 above, and upon the overriding imperative underpinned by paragraph 4 of the 1985 Regulations and paragraph 6 of the 2011 Regulations, to the effect that the method used to arrive at the Revenue Foregone in Diamond’s case must ensure that Diamond was <span style="font-style:italic">“no better, no worse off”</span> as a result of providing concessionary services, and that TfWM met such objectives for reimbursement.  On this basis, given what it says is the skewing effect of National Express on the TfWM Look-up table, Diamond, using its own local data, has produced its own Look-up table, the application of which represents the basis upon which its own calculation of the sums due for Revenue Foregone referred to in paragraph 19 above has been prepared. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">TfWM has, itself, challenged the accuracy of Diamond’s Look-up table on the basis that the latter has taken account only of travel on Diamond’s services and has taken no account of cross-operator travel and the reduction in average fare income that such cross operator travel would result in. TfWM has given the example of a passenger who makes a single journey on a Diamond bus, but thereafter makes a further four journeys on non-Diamond buses. In that example, the Diamond Look-up table would show that passenger as someone who was making only a single journey and would pay a single fare, but taking into account those other journeys, the passenger would, more likely, purchase a lower cost multi-operator daily or weekly ticket rather than a single Diamond fare. The effect of that example, says TfWM, is that Diamond’s Look-up table will not represent the typicality of travel of passengers travelling on Diamond’s bosses, will lead to Diamond’s Look-up table overstating the average fare that it has foregone in consequence of the Arrangements implemented by TfWM, and thus lead to Diamond being overcompensated for the Fares Foregone Claim. I will call this issue <span style="font-style:italic">“the Cross-Operator Issue”</span>.</p>

This is said to demonstrate the fallacy of the contention that pre-action disclosure will assist the dispute to be resolved without proceedings or result in costs being saved. On this basis, TfWM submits that there is no real prospect of pre-action disclosure of the data sought producing any of the outcomes referred to in paragraph 26 above, and therefore no real prospect, even in principle, of any of the disjunctive limbs of CPR 31.16(3)(d) being satisfied in the present case. </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.17in;margin-right:0.45in"><span style="color:#333333">Based on DfT's guidance, it is TfWM's view that the accuracy of the Look-up table used </span>for calculating Average Fare Foregone increases with the amount of data that is included. As such the current approach used by TfWM is to use data based on the entire West Midlands area passenger data. DBL's Average Fare Foregone claim, as set out in its draft Particulars of Claim, is based on an assumption by DBL that demand from concessionary fare passengers is lower on its services than the average demand from concessionary fare passengers for all bus operators across the West Midlands areas. The level of demand from concessionary fare passengers plays a significant role in the calculation of a number of elements of reimbursement under the scheme, not just in the calculation of the Average Fare Foregone. If the disclosure of the requested information supports the assumption that demand on DBL's services is lower, and Oxera produce an updated Look-up table to reflect this, with a higher Average Fare Foregone, the lower demand would mean that DBL would be entitled to lower reimbursements in relation to other elements of the Scheme reimbursement calculations. By way of an example the base level of demand used within the generation factor element of the reimbursement calculations under the Scheme is based on averages across the West Midlands area. If DBL's demand is lower than average, then this would need to be applied to this element of the reimbursement calculations. The result of this would be a smaller number of journeys paid at the Average Fare Forgone cost rate and larger number at marginal cost rate, reducing the reimbursement rate and therefore overall level of reimbursement that DBL receive.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.17in;margin-right:0.45in">Accordingly, if TfWM were to accept an alternative look up table produced by Oxera, then it would also be necessary to recalculate wider elements of reimbursement under the Scheme Arrangements. It is for this reason that TfWM consider that the Average Fare Foregone dispute should be determined by an independent under the Dispute Resolution Procedure, looking at the calculations as a whole. On that basis, it is therefore unlikely that disclosure of the data and production of a further Look-up table in relation to one element of reimbursement under the scheme will be of use to the parties in either disposing of or narrowing the Average Fare Foregone Dispute as it will not capture the wider ramifications of such changes to reimbursement as a whole.”</p>

          <intro>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I have set out in some detail above, how TfWM’s case in respect of these differences in principle is articulated as set out in paragraph 76 and 77 of Mr Lewis’s witness statement and AG’s letter dated 19 November 2021. There appear, therefrom, to be two key suggested impediments to resolving the matter prior to litigation:</p>
          </intro>
          <subparagraph>
            <num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:12pt;margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:-0.49in">i)</num>
            <content>
              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Firstly, that TfWM has appropriately used the DfT Guidelines, and that it would be wrong to contradict the DfT’s approach. In so doing, it has used data from the whole Principal Area which, so it is said, leads to greater accuracy than simply looking at Diamond’s data because the accuracy of the Look-up table used by TfWM for calculating Average Fair Foregone increases with the amount of data that is included for the purposes of the exercise. Indeed, TfWM maintains that to simply use data relating to Diamond would drastically increase the risk of an inaccurate reimbursement figure in favour of Diamond. On this basis, TfWM is unshakably confident as to the robustness of its own Look-up table so far as it might apply to Diamond, and thus its determination of Diamond’s Revenue Foregone figure.</p>
            </content>
          </subparagraph>
          <subparagraph>
            <num style="font-style:normal;font-weight:normal;font-size:12pt;margin-left:0.98in;text-indent:-0.49in">ii)</num>
            <content>
              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">Secondly, TfWM’s accusation of cherry picking. In essence, as understood, what is said is that whilst Diamond has produced a Look-up table more favourable to itself based on the fact that its passengers are more likely to use cash tickets and less likely to use discounted tickets (weekly or monthly) than the average (as highly represented by National Express), this approach would require other adjustments that would not be favourable to Diamond in arriving at a Revenue Foregone figure, including potentially to the Reimbursement Factor if not also other elements. On this basis, so it is suggested, the position is more complex than Diamond suggests and unlikely to be resolved by the provision of the data sought. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I note that paragraph 76 of Mr Lewis’s witness statement refers to Diamond’s Average Fair Foregone claim as set out in the Draft POC as being based on an assumption by Diamond that demand from concessionary fare passengers is lower on its services than the average demand from concessionary fare passengers for all bus operators across the Principal Area. AG’s letter dated 28 March 2023 makes the same point at paragraph 3(c). I have struggled to identify where, in the Draft POC, reference is made to demand, and as I have said, Mr Connolly explained the matter on the basis the skewing against Diamond that it complains about having been caused by Diamond carrying fewer passengers at discounted fares, and this was how the matter was put in, for example, Backhouse Jones’s letter dated 22 April 2021. However, I do not consider that anything ultimately turns on this as it ultimately goes to the same cherry picking point. </p>

In doing so, it is, as I see it, necessary to bear firmly in mind that the overriding consideration behind the determination of the reimbursement due to Diamond is the imperative of giving effect to the <span style="font-style:italic">“no better, no worse off”</span> principle, if necessary by departing from what would otherwise be the <span style="font-style:italic">“standard method”</span> or standard approach, as recognised by paragraph 17 of the 2000 Act Arrangements, as well as being underpinned by paragraph 4 of the 1986 Regulations and paragraph 6 of the 2011 Regulations, as well as various sections of the DfT Guidelines, including paragraph 1.10 thereof. </p>

However, in the present case, Diamond’s specific and identified concern is that the use of an average has produced a skewed result because one particular operator, National Express, forms 90% of the constituency making up the average and has a profile of passengers that does not, according to Diamond, reflect that of Diamond so far as numbers of passengers travelling on discounted fares are concerned. In these circumstances, where the key consideration is, ultimately, the subjective position of Diamond, and ensuring that it is <span style="font-style:italic">“no better, no worse off”</span>, the justification for using the larger sample on the basis that it will necessarily be more accurate is, at least, less obvious.</p>

The data that will allow for a consideration of this issue and its input into Diamond’s Look-up table is in TfWM’s possession or control. I consider that there is at least a real prospect that if Diamond, through its expert, could have access to that data in order to prepare a more robust Diamond only Look-up table, that will serve to test the reliability of TfWM’s own Look-up table and thereby assist the parties in resolving their dispute without proceedings and saving costs.</p>

I consider it relevant that Diamond has engaged Oxera (Mr Meaney) as expert, and that it is Oxera that will be processing the relevant data. In accordance with its obligations as an expert, one would expect Oxera to understand the need to make other appropriate adjustments as a result of the data supplied, even if they go against Diamond.</p>

However, if the overriding objective of the Arrangements and the legislation and regulations that underpin them is to ensure that no operator should be either better off or worse off, as is the case, then if some different treatment were required to achieve this given the subjective attributes of a particular operator, then I consider that any different treatment must be capable of being justified from a public law perspective. Indeed, the different treatment could be said to be justified in order to ensure that all operators were equally treated by ensuring that they were all neither better off not worse off through their provision of concessionary services. The argument advanced on behalf of TfWM would be liable to make paragraph 17 of the 2000 Act Arrangements meaningless. </p>

Under paragraph 2 thereof, if the dispute is not resolved as a result of the meeting provided for by paragraph 1, then, as I see it, either party has the option of proposing to the other in writing that the dispute be referred to an independent expert, and if the parties are then unable to agree on an independent expert, or the independent expert or unwilling to act, then either party has the option of applying to the President of the Law Society to appoint an independent expert - see paragraphs 2 and 3. Paragraph 4 then provides that if any matter is so referred to the independent expert for determination, then the independent expert <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">shall</span> determine the matter. The effect of this is, as I see it, that either party has the option to force the appointment of an independent expert, appointed, if necessary, by the President of the Law Society.

TfWM clearly understands what is sought, in that Mr Lewis, in paragraph 47 of his witness statement, acknowledges that TfWM would be able to provide the data within a reasonable period of time.

However, Diamond has, in my judgment, advanced what might fairly be considered to be cogent reasons as to why a Revenue Foregone figure based upon statistics relating to all bus operators in the Principal Area might well be skewed against Diamond because of the predominance of National Express (90%) in the constituency from which the relevant averages are arrived at. Further, Diamond has demonstrated that any such skewing might well serve to mean that the fundamental <span style="font-style:italic">“no better, no worse” </span>objectives are not achieved by TfWM’s Revenue Foregone figures. Consequently, there may well, as I see it, be merit in Diamond’s claim. </p>

If there is a real prospect, as I consider that there is, of the data sought by the Application addressing the impact of the Cross-Operator issue on Diamond’s Look-up table, then there is, as I see it, merit in there being disclosure thereof at this stage even though it might serve to undermine the merits of Diamond’s case because there is a real prospect, in that scenario, of it assisting the dispute to be resolved without proceedings, and/or saving costs.</p>
