            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">On Wednesday afternoon I heard further from the parties concerning consequential matters arising from my judgment on the merits handed down remotely on 26 May 2023.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">By that judgment, I dismissed all the claims brought by the claimant, Henderson and Jones, against the five remaining defendants, those claims comprising multiple claims for breach of directors' duties, knowing assistance, negligence and unlawful conspiracy.  It fell to me then to consider the consequences of my judgment in terms of costs and interest.  I gave my order then with, given the hour, reasons to follow.  These are those reasons.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">At the outset there was no dispute between the parties as to the following matters: 1) that the defendants should have their costs of these proceedings; 2) that the claimant should make a payment on account of those costs; 3) the defendants should have pre-judgment interests on their costs; and 4) that the defendants should have post-judgment interest at the statutory rate.</p>
          </content>
        </paragraph>
        <paragraph eId="para_4">
          <num style="font-size:12pt;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:-0.25in">4.</num>
          <content>
            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">The parties did differ on the following matters: 1) whether the defendants should have their costs on the indemnity basis, as they contended, or the standard basis as the claimant contended; 2) whether the amount of the payment on account by the claimant to the defendants should be 80 per cent of incurred costs as most of the defendants contended, or 50 per cent as the claimant contended; 3) the rate of pre-judgment interest, whether 4 per cent as the defendants all contended, or some lesser figure or range of figures as the claimant contended; 4) when post-judgment interest should start to run, whether from the date of my order for the payment of costs as the defendants contended or the conclusion of any detailed assessment as the claimant contended, and finally, 5) the timing of whatever payment on account I might order.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Turning to the basis of assessment first, whether indemnity or standard, the starting point is that costs should be awarded on the standard basis, but indemnity costs may be appropriate where there is something in the conduct of the parties or the circumstances of the case or both that takes the situation out of the norm.  I was referred by the parties to various authorities concerning the relevant considerations for the court as to whether a matter does or does not fall outside the norm so as to warrant or not an award of costs on the indemnity basis.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">As to those, the first and second defendants relied on <span style="font-style:italic">Clutterbuck</span> v <span style="font-style:italic">HSBC plc</span> [2015] EWHC 3233 (Ch) (at [16] to [17]) for the proposition that, in the ordinary course, costs should be awarded on the indemnity basis at the end of an unsuccessful fraud trial.  The issue in that case arose following a discontinuance but the first and second defendants say it makes no difference to the principle.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">Given that the claim here was that D1 and D2 were dishonest and conspired with others to cause harm to creditors and, it was said, the claim failed in its entirety and was not a close-run thing, the defendant’s position ought to be reflected in an indemnity costs order.  </p>

          <content>
            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">D1 and D2 relied on three further matters: 1) the failure by the claimant to adduce any evidence from Clement Keys -- THMG's accountants and auditors; 2) the publicity generated by the claimant, it was said, in pejorative terms; and 3) perhaps relatedly, the suggested realpolitik of this case, namely that D1 and D2 are of limited means and were only dragged along in the case in the hope of success against D5 and/or D6 whose pockets are considerably deeper.</p>

            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in">D3, Mr Gerard Barnes, filed a skeleton argument for Wednesday's hearing but it was confirmed then that Ms Page's client and the claimant had agreed matters of interest and costs and I therefore say nothing further about D3's position on those matters.</p>

            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">D5, the bank, says that this claim should never have been pursued against it.  The claimant could have brought a stop to things much earlier by accepting a drop hands offer in June 2020, but decided to persist in unfounded dishonesty claims against the bank as well as engaging in unacceptably poor conduct of these proceedings.</p>

            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">D5 relied on the matters enumerated in <span style="font-style:italic">Three Rivers District Council</span> v <span style="font-style:italic">Bank of England</span> [2006] Costs Law Review 714 (at [25(4)-(8)]).</p>

            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">Although it was accepted that there is no automatic rule that the failure of a case of dishonesty or fraud will justify an order for indemnity costs, D5 pointed to authority indicating that they are routinely awarded in such cases, reflecting the fact that the defendant had no choice but to come to court to defend the allegations as well as the distressing experience of their target, Mr Sweeney.  D5 also said that the claims are speculative, weak, opportunistic and thin in terms of the lack of any cogent motive for Mr Sweeney to have acted dishonestly, the lack of any proper basis for the conspiracy claim, the substantial overstatement of the claim value and the lack of any witness of its own.  D5 also pointed to other aspects where it said the claimant fell below the standard expected in the conduct of these proceedings, as well as courting publicity for the claim.</p>

            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">Finally in terms of the defendants, D6 too sought indemnity costs including by reference to the dishonesty allegations, and <span style="font-style:italic">Clutterbuck</span> and <span style="font-style:italic">Three Rivers</span>, the speculative, weak, or thin nature of the claims, the suggested selective or blinkered approach to the documents, the claimant's suggested briefing of the press and the claimant's letter to members of D6's firm, informing them of the large amount of the claim, the  non-application of their limitation clause and their engagement letter in the event of wilful default and the risk of contribution to partnership assets in the event of insolvent liquidation.</p>

            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">The claimant, by contrast, said an award of indemnity costs was not justified, emphasing that there is no mechanistic approach or rule that unsuccessful allegations of dishonesty attract indemnity costs and neither <span style="font-style:italic">Three Rivers</span> nor <span style="font-style:italic">Clutterbuck</span> says otherwise.  There must be a high level of inappropriateness or unreasonableness and the failure of a case of fraud or dishonesty is but one potentially relevant factor, see Mr Justice Miles in <span style="font-style:italic">Libyan Investment Authority and others</span> v <span style="font-style:italic">King and Others</span> [2023] EWHC 434 (Ch) (at [6]).</p>

            <p class="NoSpacing" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0in">Nor, more broadly, the claimant said, should an award of indemnity costs be made simply because the paying party has been found to be wrong, or its evidence rejected in favour of that of the receiving party (see <span style="font-style:italic">Williams</span> v <span style="font-style:italic">Jarvis</span> [2009] EWHC 1837 (QB) (at [13]).</p>

Having considered their positions, both individually and collectively, I made such an award in favour of all the defendants. I came to that view for a number of related reasons which, considered together, do take this case out of the norm and reflect, in my view, unreasonable conduct to such a high level to warrant an order for indemnity costs.  I make clear that I did not do so by way of moral condemnation of the claimant, which is not a requirement for such an order to be made.  I also made clear in light of the concerns expressed by the claimant at the hearing that the mere fact the claimant was a litigation funder made no difference to my decision.  Litigation funding is commonplace these days and does provide an important function affording access to justice where otherwise that may not be possible.</p>

In paragraph 575 of my judgment, I described the claimant's overall approach which led me to reject its characterisation of the restructure. That approach pervaded the claims as against each defendant, in particular the claimant's characterisation of matters depending in large part on its own interpretation, often quite strained, of a handful of incomplete documents or other complete documents not placed in proper context.</p>

I need not repeat these matters set out in my judgment but, when these were all put together as the suggested basis for a conspiracy said to involve all five defendants engaged in dishonest conduct, the weakness or thinness of the claim was palpable.  That approach was the principal reason why such a detailed factual analysis was required in this case, not because it was so closely contested.</p>

Nor did his suggested motive for acting dishonestly make any sense.  Barclays had no need to approve the restructure, and it will only have shot itself in the foot if it had consented, in effect, to the demise and insolvency of the very company which would remain its borrower after the restructure had taken place.</p>

Clement Keys was involved in every aspect of the restructure and of its accounting sought to be impugned by the claimant. It signed off on the accounts and it confirmed that THMG remained a going concern thereafter.

It is sufficient for me to highlight one point.  Although I accept that PIP implants, and the impact on the women who had them implanted, are matters of considerable public interest and concern, and whatever the precise level of engagement with the media on the claimant's part and its timing, I am satisfied that the claimant positively courted publicity to increase pressure on the defendants in this case, particularly D5.  For example, in their article written for the Evening Standard on 4 October 2022, a month before trial, two directors of the claimant acting in that capacity widely shared their view of Barclays as a target for this claim, and if the so-called floodgates were opened, others like it.  Again, the claimant was entitled to take this course, but having gone out of its way to publicise so widely its view that the restructure was <span style="font-style:italic">illegally</span> designed to <span style="font-style:italic">defraud</span> THMG's creditors with the <span style="font-style:italic">dishonest</span> assistance of D5, the bank knowing or having reason to suspect that the restructure was <span style="font-style:italic">illegal</span>, the claimant can expect to be visited with an order for indemnity costs given the other matters I have described in this ruling and the findings in my judgment.  Fifth, I was also unable to accept the claimant's valuation of the claim, principally due to the double counting of the value of the property and the business, even though both reflected the same earnings stream.  That issue was not considered sufficiently at the outset by the claimant's expert who had been instructed to add the value of the property to his calculation.  This resulted in that calculation being significantly overstated.  I am satisfied that this unrealistic approach to value was also calculated to put pressure on the defendants and it would have been apparent to the claimant that the value of its claim was, as I have also found by quite some distance, an outlier compared to the contemporaneous valuations undertaken.  I am also satisfied that the unrealistic figures bandied about on the claimant's side did have a chilling effect on settlement prospects in this case.</p>

However, each of the defendants provided updated, albeit not necessarily final, cost figures for the purpose of the respective payments on account they sought.

For D5 the costs incurred are £3.092 million, including irrecoverable VAT with an interim payment of £2.5 million sought, apparently representing 77.9 per cent of the costs plus pre-judgment interest at 4 per cent, and for D6 the costs incurred are £1.917 million, excluding VAT, with an 80 per cent interim payment of £1.53 million sought.</p>

In doing so I recognise that the court did not have the benefit of any prior cost budgeting exercise, albeit I took into account the prior estimates exchanged between the parties, recognising their limitations. I also paid close regard to what the claimant said as to the level of costs incurred by the different defendants as indicated in the updated figures and how it was suggested these would likely be reduced on assessment.  Having considered these matters, the parties' submissions, my finding as to the basis of assessment, my view, having conducted the trial as to the substance of the case and the likely costs incurred and recoverable by the defendants, as well as the prospects of any appeal, as to which I had already considered the claimant's grounds of appeal, I was satisfied that an appropriate payment on account in this case, after applying in the claimant's favour a margin of error avoiding the risk of overpayment, was for each of the defendants, 70 per cent of the amount stated in their respective updated summaries of costs incurred to date.

The question was what should the rate be.  The authorities indicate that the purpose of an interest award is to compensate the successful party for the loss of his money, or the costs of borrowing to fund the litigation and that the rate may differ where the litigant is a private individual who tends to recover a higher rate than in more normal commercial lending to reflect the reality that their cost of borrowing is higher.  Undertaking, as I had to do, a general appraisal of the position having regard to what was reasonable and the classes of litigant before me, namely three individuals, a leading Midlands law firm and a first-class bank, I was satisfied the appropriate pre-judgment interest rate in this case for D1 and D2 was 4 per cent per annum, for D5 2.5 per cent and for D6, 3 per cent.</p>

Given the number of grounds, I shall provide brief written reasons separately and in all likelihood by way of attachment to the form N460 itself which I shall circulate as soon as I can so that the claimant is equipped, as necessary, for the Court of Appeal.  I merely say here that the claimant's overall approach seemed to me to be to seek to re-open findings which were perfectly open to me, or indeed any reasonable tribunal, to make on the evidence and the facts before it.</p>
