            <content>
              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">This appeal concerns the conditions for claiming additional corporation tax relief for expenditure on research and development (“R&amp;D”) pursuant to the Rules in Chapter 2 Part 13 Corporation Tax Act 2009 (“Part 13”).</p>

              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">In broad terms, the appellant (“SOCS”) has appealed against the respondents’ (“HMRC’s”) refusal of its claims under the provisions of Part 13 for what is commonly referred to as “SME relief” or “enhanced research and development relief”. Those claims were made in respect of its accounting periods (“APs”) ending on 31 December 2017, 2018 and 2019 (“the Relevant Periods”).</p>

            <content>
              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">In brief outline, SOCS argues that the R&amp;D expenditure is qualifying expenditure and it is neither subsidised expenditure nor expenditure incurred in carrying out contracted R&amp;D activities. HMRC argues that it is both subsidised and contracted out. </p>
            </content>

            <content>
              <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">SOCS appeals the two Discovery Assessments issued by HMRC in respect of the APs ending on 31 December 2017 and 2018 and the Closure Notice relating to the AP ending 31 December 2019 amending SOCS’ corporation tax return for that period (“the 2019 Return”). The 2017 Discovery Assessment was raised under paragraph 41 of Schedule 18 Finance Act 1998 (“Schedule 18”) and the 2018 Discovery Assessment was raised under paragraph 52 of Schedule 18. </p>

The documents to which we were referred comprised a Hearing Bundle consisting of 1,349 pages and an Authorities Bundle consisting of 997 pages. We were subsequently furnished with a copy of a missing email dated 9 October 2020 and a copy of “CIRD81900-R&amp;D tax relief: conditions to be satisfied: DTI guidelines (2004)”.</p>

Regulations were made under section 1006 prescribing certain activities as research and development, namely The Research and Development (Prescribed Activities) Regulations 2004/712.</p>

Those were known as the BIS Guidelines and latterly, following a merger of Government departments, as the BEIS Guidelines. We annex relevant excerpts therefrom at Appendix 1.

In explaining the history and purpose of sections 1052(5-6) and 1053 (4-5) CTA 20009, Officer Hamblin explained that those sections reflect three separate policy requirements, being avoiding market distortion in terms of ensuring the rules were compatible with the State Aid rules (and therefore obtaining European Commission notification), not discriminating between subsidised and unsubsidised taxpayers, and avoiding double claims. The first two go hand-in-hand. That was not challenged and we accept that. We find that the purpose of the legislation is to provide relief for R&amp;D expenditure where the statutory requirements are met.</p>

            <p class="Taxbodytext1" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.39in">There was no real dispute between the parties about the relevant legislative provisions. It is common ground that the assessments under both paragraphs 41 and 52 of Schedule 18 are subject to the provisions of paragraph 44 of Schedule 18. That paragraph provides protection for the taxpayer. As can be seen from the first Discovery Issue at paragraph 12 above, it says that if at a time when an officer ceased to be entitled to give a notice of enquiry into a return, then if they “could not have been reasonably expected, on the basis of the information made available to them before that time, to be aware” that an assessment of tax had become insufficient, then a discovery assessment can be raised.</p>

Accordingly, the R&amp;D activity was performed because of the contracts to deliver goods and services and as a necessary part of fulfilling SOCS’ obligations under the contracts.

That document is detailed and extends to 15 closely typed pages detailing what SOCS is contractually bound to provide.

The eventual cost, in terms of what was delivered, was much greater than originally anticipated at the point of quotation. That cost was incurred in the form of additional man hours incurred in the designing of the Pavilion’s construction methodology and elaborate opening façade.

He explained that no appeal had been made “Because we considered it appropriate to take a better worked case so we could have the matter heard…” and that that was a tactical decision because the sub-contract point had not been canvassed before the Tribunal in <span style="font-style:italic">Quinn</span>.

In their view, it follows that the Clients indirectly ‘met’ the claimed expenditure by paying Quinn for its services. Quinn argued that, on the contrary, it cannot be said that the claimed expenditure was ‘met’ by Clients who, under an entirely commercial arrangement, simply paid a price for a product, the finished building works.”</p>

The use of that particular term indicates the scope of Condition E in general terms as then further explained in s 1138, albeit that the use of that term in the heading to that section does not control the operation of the substantive provisions in that section.</p>

However, I cannot see what basis HMRC have, on their own analysis, for drawing a distinction on the basis of the timing of the relevant ordinary trading transactions. In each case, the payments made by the customers or clients for the relevant services or products provided by the taxpayer could be used by the taxpayer to cover its expenditure on R&amp;D which it uses for the purposes of that trading transaction.

With respect, that logic does not follow. If the draftsperson intended to mean the same thing, they would have used the same wording. The fact that they chose to draft (c) differently should be respected in its interpretation. The ordinary meaning of ‘meet’ or ‘met’ in the Oxford English Dictionary encompasses being able to or sufficient to discharge or satisfy or fulfil a financial obligation.

Introducing a requirement that there is specific provision as to R&amp;D in the contract would make it all too easy for taxpayers to get around this requirement and obtain the very generous relief. In any event, in each of the three projects before the Tribunal here, the price was increased to take account of the additional work that was required in order to deliver on the project. [Footnote: The Appellant has failed to adduce any evidence that would demonstrate these increases were attributable to anything other than R&amp;D.]</span></p>

HMRC’s position does allow for exploitation of the R&amp;D for commercial gain. If, for example, a taxpayer undertakes R&amp;D in January and then in April is able to exploit the expenditure in the context of a commercial contract with a customer, that would qualify for relief on HMRC’s analysis. There is, in HMRC’s submission, a clear distinction between a trader who incurs R&amp;D in the course of carrying out a contract, and the sums from the contract cover those costs – where it can naturally be said the customer has ‘met’ the costs of the expenditure; and the example above where it could not be said that the expenditure incurred in January is ‘met’ by the sums received from the contract in April.”</p>

As noted above, Part 13 is a meticulously drafted and highly prescriptive regime [</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Gripple</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">]. In drafting these provisions, Parliament had to ensure there was no additional State Aid (as explained in the Witness Statement of Philip Hamblin…), and had to do so in express and emphatic terms. The purpose, therefore, of s.1138(1)(a) and (b) is to inform the reader in clear terms of specific exclusions; and then (c) is an additional category to cover other expenditure met by third parties.  Further, (a) works differently from (b) and (c): (a) prevents </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman'">all</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> expenditure incurred from benefiting from Enhanced R&amp;D Relief; (b) and (c) do not exclude expenditure on the same project which is outside their scope. The fact that Parliament could potentially have achieved the same result with a differently drafted (c) does not mean it has no purpose. Even if there were a degree of surplusage, there are good reasons for it given the State Aid considerations.

An emphasis of the obvious, unnecessary to a judge who has had the benefit of argument, may yet be welcome to a busy practitioner who has not.’ [The footnote cites other cases to which we were not referred.]”</span></p>

However, we are somewhat bemused by the argument that Judge Morgan’s logic was flawed, because on finding that sub-paragraphs (a) and (b) require  a clear link between the funding  and the expenditure, she stated that it reinforced her view that sub-paragraph (c)  also requires such a link. HMRC argue that the legislation uses the word “met” in sub-paragraph (c) whereas the words “obtained in respect of” are used in the two preceding paragraphs so the requirement for a clear link in the first two sub-paragraphs cannot be extrapolated to the third. </p>

Judge Morgan did not state that there was a requirement that there was a specific provision as to R&amp;D in the contracts. Her decision was far more nuanced than that. She had three sub-paragraphs in paragraph 47(4) explaining why, on the facts, which are similar to those in this appeal, and for the reasons given, the expenditure was incurred for delivery of a specific project and may not even cover the R&amp;D costs. </p>

Although, undoubtedly, as SOCS has always stated, “The R&amp;D activity was undertaken to put the company in a position to fulfil our contractual obligations”, that does not mean that that was the cause of price increases. Further, as can be seen from paragraph 89(f) above, Officer Aspey had accepted that the variations in the contracts were not necessarily directly related to R&amp;D.</p>

It certainly does appear that neither HMRC nor SOCS had made that point before that, and the 2018 Discovery Assessment was based on the presumption of continuity. We do not accept the argument that that demonstrates the difficulty in identifying what is at issue from the R&amp;D Reports. On reading the 2018 R&amp;D Report it is very clear to us that the freestanding projects had no client. Many related to SOCS’ proprietary motion control system, QMotion. Another described “creating a new product”. We had no difficulty in identifying which projects were “in-house” and which were not.

HMRC’s view was that the Condition referred to “activities” rather than to R&amp;D to ensure that the effect was wider than that and expenditure incurred by a company carrying out activities contracted to it by a third party would not qualify.</p>

These factors are no longer referred to in the guidance, which now focuses on the contractual relationship of the parties: where an SME is contractually engaged to deliver a product or project, HMRC will regard that as subcontracting from an R&amp;D perspective.”</span></p>

Ms Bellerby believed that there was no sub-contracting because the contracts were contracts to provide services and not for a specific part of the activity; that was the same as a large project in the earlier enquiry which had involved manufacturing, testing and installing dynamic structures and HMRC had been content.</p>

The writer asked for better guidance from HMRC since the uncertainty caused by the current guidance and the “narrowed approach” encouraged “rogue agents”.</span></p>

HMRC had already seen the contracts. There would have been no point in exploring, for example, ownership of the intellectual property if it sufficed to know that there was a contract.  Officer Richardson stated that HMRC accepted that there was no sub-contract. That suggests to us that HMRC were following the old version of the CIRD. They did say that they wished to refer the issue of subsidy to policy ie Officer Hamblin. It was at that point that it was decided that HMRC would revert to the terms of the letter of 30 October 2020.</span></p>

That recognised that it was possible for an SME company to satisfy Condition D where, for example, it had autonomy, bore the risks and retained ownership of the intellectual property.  Those were not the only factors that might be relevant; each project had to be examined on its own merits. The need for a “clear and direct link” in relation to condition E was certainly a vague specification, but we find that the evidence that the new version of CIRD81650 was a change, and a significant change, is an indication that the PGP before 2019 was to look for such a link with R&amp;D and not with incidental expenditure incurred in delivering a contract.</span></p>

The legislation defining “subsidised expenditure” provides that if a grant or subsidy is received which is not notified State Aid, the expenditure is subsidised to the extent that it does not exceed the subsidy.  This may result in the expenditure qualifying for R&amp;D tax relief partly under the SME scheme and partly under the large company scheme for RDEC.</span></p>

So expenditure may be “subsidised expenditure” even though the payments are not, for example, a grant or subsidy paid by a public body.</span></p>

            <p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">NS agreed that the guidance required further review to give an indication of where the boundary lay between subsidised and non-subsidised expenditure.  The meaning of ‘subsidised’ (CTA 2009 S1138) referred to expenditure being met directly or indirectly which was not particularly helpful as all expenditure is met indirectly in some way or other.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align:left"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Currently HMRC took the view that there needed to be a clear and direct link between the payment received and the qualifying expenditure.</span></p>
