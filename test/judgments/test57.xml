MAN would incorporate Microlise telematics technology into its vehicles, and then sell or lease those vehicles to its customer base under what was known as a <span style="font-family:'Arial Unicode MS'">“</span>white label” agreement. One of those MAN customers was Zenith since 2010/11. Mr Keates was the CEO of Zenith at that time. He had experience of the Microlise technology on the MAN trucks operated by Zenith. Mr Keates had known Mr Magee of Microlise since 2012. Mr Keates requested a meeting with Mr Magee, which happened in October 2015, where Mr Keates explained that he had become involved with Uniserve. This is because Uniserve UK Limited had purchased Zenith that same month. Mr Magee understood that Mr Keates was responsible for dealing with the Uniserve fleet of trucks. That October 2015 meeting led to the start of a direct business relationship between Microlise and Uniserve. It led to various business quotes from Mr Magee to Mr Keates.</p>

Their evidence was provided several years after the contractual negotiations. It generally tracked the outlines of their respective pleaded cases.

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Mr Magee was a credible witness. However I consider that his evidence was significantly vague both on the contractual details and their effect on the products and services that he was selling. Mr Magee was equivocal at best when asked to explain what he understood to be Microlise’s General terms &amp; conditions. He was similarly so in relation to Microlise’s Standard terms &amp; conditions. This was important because the rider on each Q/O form referred to those terms &amp; conditions in various different guises. Mr Magee was unable to give meaningful evidence on the difference between, and application of, General and Standard terms.</p>

The Q/O forms had different riders throughout the contracting history between the parties. It is not surprising that Mr Magee was unable to explain these variations or their effect. Mr Magee agreed that part of his sales task was to send out the SPSA, as part of the new customer package, and then get a signed copy back from his customer. </p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Mr Magee described that his first Q/O form was sent to Mr Keates in October 2015 and referred to the Uniserve Group, which probably came from the email footer of Mr Keates. The actual legal entity at that stage was not a priority for Mr Magee since that came at a later stage when there was an agreement in principle. His second Q/O form sent to Mr Keates in December 2015 contained the new customer details form and a draft contract that he referred to as Microlise’s Master Supply Agreement (“MSA”).  It is agreed that this MSA is synonymous with the SPSA. Mr Magee had sent the SPSA as a Word document and only completed two sections and referred to the Uniserve Group. Mr Magee at that time did not consider Uniserve Group to be the customer or who the contract was intended to be with. It was not his job to carry out checks on the named entity. Microlise generally would not enter a contract with a number of companies and with liability split amongst those companies. If an order is being placed by a company with Microlise, then that company must have its own account set up with Microlise’s accounts team. That required an account opening process that included credit checks, hence the need for the new customer details form.</p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Mr Magee stated that in 2015 Microlise had two ways of contracting with its customers. Firstly a bespoke SPSA, with overarching terms with orders being placed using a Q/O form. Secondly, where there was no SPSA, orders could be placed using a Q/O form in isolation. Microlise would send out both an SPSA and Q/O form to a new customer, and leave it to the customer to negotiate terms of the SPSA or simply contract on the basis of the Q/O form. This is what Mr Magee says happened in December 2015. I have difficulty with his evidence on this point. This is because of the clear wording contained on the original rider of the Q/O form that refers to standard terms applying that are available on request, accompanied by the SPSA which is then referred to by Mr Magee explicitly in writing as the “standard contract”.</p>

The lack of a signed or completed version of the SPSA was raised by Mr Magee with Messrs Keates, Read or Winrow.

However, he was not able to provide any positive contemporaneous documentary evidence that corroborated this belief. Neither was any contemporaneous evidence offered involving Microlise senior management that supported Mr Magee’s position. Mr Magee sent the SPSA to Uniserve on several occasions, because he had not received feedback and did not think it had been agreed. Whilst the SPSA never contained a commencement date, it did in its second variant (still dated 18/12/15 on its front page) on 24 February 2016 contain material details of Fees at Schedule 1 and significant details of various Applications at Schedule 2.</p>

Mr Magee did not consider it significant that the SPSA reserved this specific right to Microlise, whilst the Q/O General terms and conditions did not.

Mr Keates had experience of this from the Zenith MAN collaboration. Mr Liddell tasked Mr Keates with negotiating with Microlise for the entire Uniserve Group fleet of trucks. Mr Liddell considered that this included JKL and Zenith. Mr Liddell was involved in internal Uniserve discussions about the Microlise products. Following the first Q/O on 21st October 2015, he authorised Mr Keates to progress the project. Mr Liddell was aware that there were discussions in December 2015 between Mr Magee, Mr Keates and Mr Potter of YCT. YCT Limited had been purchased by JKL. JKL was to be acquired by Uniserve a few months later in April 2016. Mr Keates asked Mr Magee for a specific quote, on 15 December 2015 for 100 telematic units. Following receipt of the Q/O on 18 December 2015 and the new customer package, Mr Liddell approved the Q/O. This enabled Mr Keates to confirm that to Mr Magee on 19 December 2015.</p>

Mr Liddell understood the Q/O forms to be nothing more than forms listing the ordered items. His understanding was that the small print terms and conditions on the back of the orders were never intended to govern the supply of the equipment and services. Mr Liddell understood that the SPSA was to govern that. He extended this belief to Uniserve employees and member companies. Mr Liddell considered that the SPSA continued to form the basis of the relationship between Uniserve and Microlise without re-negotiation or amendment. Given the existence of multiple orders over an extended period of time for Microlise devices for multiple trucks, Mr Liddell did not believe that each order needed its legal aspects considered each time - hence the purpose and existence of the SPSA.

Mr Liddell was challenged by Mr Naylor on whether his position on the existence of the SPSA had varied when problems started to emerge in 2018 and 2019. Mr Liddell explained that when he referred in an email to “there being no contract”, he was referring to any signed SPSA, as in his view a signature finished the process. I questioned Mr Liddell why he considered there to be significance relating to the SPSA being signed. Mr Liddell stated that he was aware there was no legal magic to the signatures, but it provided him with more certainty where signatures had been provided. Mr Liddell was candid in his disappointment of both administrative functions of the parties, but emphasised that he believed it was the Supplier that should drive the process, not the Customer.</p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Claimant contends that each Q/O form incorporated the General terms and conditions that was attached to that form. They do not accept that the SPSA ever came into force; that it was only sent in draft form, never completed and never signed. They say that the SPSA was always a draft, and offered for negotiation and signature in due course. </p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Claimant invites me to prefer the evidence of Mr Magee. Whilst Mr Keates was the main negotiator for Uniserve, only documentary evidence from his email account was offered in support of his former employer. Instead, Mr Liddell provided evidence, which the Claimant say is necessarily high level and at times inconsistent and should be treated with caution. </p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Claimant says that the email acceptance by Mr Keates to Mr Magee on 19 December 2015 was not any contractual acceptance of the draft SPSA. Mr Keates did not sign and scan everything back, but just the first page of the 3 year Q/O form in the name of Uniserve UK Ltd. The Claimant suggests that neither party considered the contract to be concluded at this stage, since Mr Magee had made it clear that the relevant Uniserve counter-party needed to be identified in the “new customer details” form. </p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Claimant asserts that the Q/O forms included a full copy of the General terms and conditions and plainly stated that they would apply to any order that the customer might subsequently place. This was, therefore, the ‘default’ position. I do not agree with this submission, as the original rider on the October and December 2015 Q/O forms expressly stated that they were subject to the Microlise standard terms and conditions that were available on request. Nevertheless, the Claimant also states that it was always open to the customer to negotiate and conclude a customer-specific contract, an SPSA, which would then override the Q/O form. This option was expressly referred to in Microlise’s Q/O forms, with the revised rider, from February 2016 onwards. In my view it was also open to the customer to accept the SPSA without negotiation.</p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">They further assert that by attaching the draft and incomplete SPSA to his email of 18 December 2015, Mr Magee gave the opportunity to negotiate and possibly conclude a customer specific contract on behalf of one or more identified legal entities with Microlise. In order to do so, however, Mr Keates would have been required to complete the draft SPSA and, ultimately, both parties would have been required to sign it. On an objective analysis they submit that the orthodox application of straightforward ‘offer and acceptance’ principles leads to the result that the Q/O form General terms and conditions were incorporated into the contracts between Microlise and Uniserve / JKL.</p>

I sent through a copy on the 18 April…”</span> They say it should be considered in its proper context; one of an escalating dispute between the parties, which Mr Magee was attempting to defuse. To that end they remind me that Mr Magee is not himself a lawyer but rather a salesman; whatever his subjective view may have been on the terms applicable, what really matters is the objective analysis of how the contracts were concluded.</p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">When the Q/O form was sent by Microlise on 18 December 2015, it was accompanied by both the SPSA terms and the new customer details form. The Q/O form contained the original rider. Mr Magee stated in the accompanying email that the “standard contract” was attached. They submit, quite rightly in my view, that cannot have been a reference to the General terms and conditions (i.e. contained at page 2 and 3 of the Q/O form), since those were immediately below (hence not what was referred to as “available on request”). They submit that statement must reasonably have been understood to refer to the SPSA terms, i.e. the Microlise standard contract. The version that finally became order SL-013106 was signed and returned by Mr Keates on 1 February 2016 to Mr Magee. The form returned by Mr Keates was the Q/O form, less page 2 and 3.  The Deployment Scope document, in line with the SPSA terms, confirmed the parties’ agreement that Microlise would supply equipment and associated systems and services to the Uniserve Group to be used by the fleet. On 24 February 2016 Microlise re-sent the SPSA terms to Uniserve. That version issued on that date had been updated significantly. Hence they submit that the objective intention of the parties was that, from the very first order issued, the SPSA terms were to apply and not the Q/O form General terms. This was also Mr Magee’s own understanding when the matter was raised by Mr Liddell in May 2018.</p>

It does not appear to have ever been signed by Mr Keates, and in any case expressly contained the revised rider that recognised SPSA terms and conditions would apply in preference to the Q/O form General terms. Uniserve submits that this was a clear reference to the SPSA terms that had already been agreed. In my view, that is objectively correct, and consistent with the documented negotiations up to that point in time.</p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">They explain the lack of signature of the SPSA by any of the Defendants as an administrative oversight   However, the Court is invited to infer that a contract had been agreed on the SPSA terms, and the request by Mr Magee on 4 April 2017 was merely an administrative updating exercise. I accept that submission as being objectively correct and consistent with the documentary evidence.</p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">They also highlight that Mr Magee sent Mr Liddell a copy of the SPSA as the contract that had been agreed, in response to a request on 18 April 2018. When asked by Mr Liddell on 2 May 2018 to confirm how the contracts operated vis-à-vis the three entities (JKL, UHL and Zenith), Mr Magee responded by stating there was a contract just with Uniserve Group not each division.

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Defendants agree that the evidential picture is incomplete without Mr Keates and Mr Read, but also the evidence objectively was muddled. At different times both sides were mistaken about what the position actually was. They invite me to draw the proper inferences that Mr Magee correlated the phrase “Standard terms and conditions” with the SPSA, when he sent the email package to Mr Keates on 18 December 2015 containing the SPSA. In my view, objectively that must be correct. They also invite me to construe that communication against the backdrop of objective commerciality. They point to certain features of the contractual relationship where the SPSA expressly permits, but the Q/O form General terms &amp; conditions do not, acceptance of orders for quotes in excess of 30 days. They highlight the insertion of material order details by Microlise to the SPSA in February 2016. They submit that the totality of the evidence cumulatively and corroboratively establishes that it is more likely than not that both parties actually regarded the terms of the SPSA to apply to that relationship. I accept that submission as being objectively correct.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The first order placed by Uniserve was SL-013106 dated 18 December 2015, but not signed until 1 February 2016. The delay, well in excess of the 30-day validity of the Microlise quote, was due to Microlise credit checks resulting in a new customer account for UHL. Normal procedure was followed by Microlise in the run up to that 1 February 2016 order; the December 2015 Q/O forms provided by Microlise to Uniserve were accompanied by the Microlise “standard contract” and new customer form. The original rider on those Q/O forms referred to the application of Microlise standard terms &amp; conditions (available on request), and not to the integral Q/O General terms &amp; conditions. Objectively, I consider that the SPSA was the “standard contract”, and that the Q/O rider reference to standard terms and conditions was to the SPSA. This is because there was no other standard contract or other standard terms and conditions at any stage between December 2015 and 1 February 2016, save for the SPSA. Had Microlise intended to rely upon their Q/O form General terms and conditions, they would have specified that, which they did not. Instead, Microlise expressly referred to their standard terms and conditions, available on request, in their Q/O form. This was corroborated by Mr Magee providing the standard contract - the SPSA, as part of that package.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In my view, the only objective and commercial interpretation of intent was that Microlise was prepared to offer 100 telematics devices to Uniserve subject to the terms of its standard contract - the SPSA. On the face of that documentary evidence, the terms of the SPSA were incorporated by specific reference. As intended, they took precedence over the General terms &amp; conditions integral to the Q/O form. Mr Keates from Uniserve confirmed his acceptance of those terms. In my judgment there is also cumulative evidence that supports my objective assessment throughout the entire correspondence between, and conduct of, the parties that accords with my finding that the SPSA was incorporated by reference from 1 February 2016. </p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Mr Magee was not able to explain how or when either the Standard or General terms applied, and any interrelationship they may or may not have. In my judgment, as a matter of objective construction, Standard terms cannot be equated with General terms in this dispute. To do so invites a measure of chaos and a lack of commercial common sense. Superficially it may appear that Microlise offered their supply of equipment and services with two different sets of terms and conditions, one General set on each Q/O form and one Standard set via the SPSA. However, my objective assessment is that Microlise were only offering the Standard terms. This is because the original rider on the December Q/O form clearly stated that it was the Standard terms that would apply, and these were sent alongside the Q/O form as the SPSA. The SPSA understandably states that it overrules the Q/O form General terms. This is entirely consistent with the express purpose of the SPSA. The SPSA does not need to be in the same name as each Q/O form, or each new customer details form. It is a framework agreement.</p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">  The SPSA terms were substantially more detailed than the Q/O form general terms. Mr Magee only ever expressly referred to the SPSA when he highlighted the standard contract. The General terms &amp; conditions were never referred to by Mr Magee. Mr Magee did not direct Uniserve to sign the SPSA initially, nor the Q/O form nor its integral General terms &amp; conditions. The Q/O form directs only signature on page 1 and does not refer to signature elsewhere. Mr Magee never explained to Uniserve that there was a choice between the Standard and General terms. Mr Magee did not explain that the terms of the SPSA were negotiable. A signed Q/O form was sufficient to constitute an offer by Uniserve in the eyes of Microlise since the constitutive elements of the contract were in place. That offer by Uniserve was subsequently accepted by Microlise through performance. </p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The SPSA terms contained detailed provisions on Quotes and Orders (Clauses 2 and 4), whilst the General terms did not. Whilst the duration of a Quote was 30 days, and Microlise would exercise commercial discretion on accepting orders outside that period, the SPSA preserved that discretion whilst the General terms were silent. The General terms did not refer to the Quote above, nor do they say that returning the Quote signed is deemed to incorporate those General terms. Notably, after 1 February 2016, the Microlise Q/O form changed its rider to state that the Standard terms were within the same Q/O form rather than available on request. However, that redrafted Q/O form provided that “previously agreed” terms and conditions would override the General terms and conditions. On an objective and commercial construction of that revised rider, and in the context of the correspondence, I am satisfied that “previously agreed” terms can only refer to the SPSA.</p>

Mr Keates signed and returned only page 1 of the 3-page pdf Q/O form. It is suggested by Mr Parratt that an inference could be made that Mr Keates did not consider the general terms applied since the SPSA had been supplied alongside the Q/O form, and that Mr Keates considered the SPSA to apply which could be completed and signed at a later stage. I am not convinced that a proper inference can be made on that specific issue, given the absence of evidence from Mr Keates. However, I do not need to make that inference since I consider that an objective and cumulative assessment of the entire correspondence and conduct between the parties evidences a mutual intention that the SPSA terms were to apply.</p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">There were three variants of the SPSA provided by Mr Magee, each with the same counterparts - Microlise and the Uniserve Group. The Uniserve Group is not a legal identity, and whilst there is provision for the “Customer” to have a Company registration number and registered offer, this was left blank throughout. Neither was there a commencement date, nor was it signed. However, in my view, the absence of these three features is not fatal to the existence of the SPSA when considered objectively against the contextual factual matrix of the parties. The SPSA was an umbrella agreement that embraced quotations and orders. This is also consistent with intentions of the parties contained within the Deployment Scope document.</p>

I do not consider the SPSA could be considered to be fatally incomplete at any stage. In that regard, I prefer the evidence of Mr Liddell that the SPSA is perfectly able to be to be read in conjunction with the commercial pricing details contained within the Q/O forms. Significantly, Mr Magee uploaded pricing details relating to order SL-013106 to Schedule 1 of the SPSA and Applications details to Schedule 2 of the SPSA and sent them to Uniserve on 24 February 2016. </p>

On 3 May 2018 he confirmed to Mr Liddell that Microlise had a contract “<span style="font-style:italic">just with Uniserve Group and not each division</span>”. Contextually and objectively, that can only have been a reference to the SPSA. Mr Magee accepted that he could have been mistaken that signature was required for the SPSA to be enforceable. In March 2019 Mr Ball (senior accounts manager at Microlise) sent Mr Liddell the SPSA as the agreed (albeit unsigned) contract in place between the parties.</p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Objectively, there is cogent and compelling commercial sense in the evidence of Mr Liddell. This is because multiple Microlise orders for multiple trucks were 1) both a possibility at the negotiation stage in 2015/2016 and 2) a reality over an extended period of time from 2016 to 2019. Mr Liddell did not consider that each order needed its legal aspects considered each time - hence the need for the SPSA. This evidence is synchronous with the contractual framework that Microlise had drafted and supplied to Uniserve leading up to 1 February 2016. </p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">To apply the words of Lord Clarke, an objective assessment of the parties’ intentions  depends not upon the subjective state of mind of either Mr Magee or Mr Keates, but upon a consideration of what was communicated between them by words or conduct, i.e. the Q/O forms with the original and revised riders, the express reference by Mr Magee to a standard contract, various iterations of the SPSA, the Deployment Scope  document and performance of, and payment for, the goods and services provided. My objective assessment of the parties’ intentions is that a contract was agreed through the vehicle of the SPSA for the formation of legally binding relations. The existence of the SPSA was confirmed by subsequent conduct and communications, by both Mr Magee and Mr Ball at Microlise. Accordingly, I conclude that the SPSA came into force on 1 February 2016. Its terms and conditions override any Q/O form General terms and conditions.</p>

UUK acquired Zenith on 9 October 2015 and UHL acquired JKL on 22 April 2016. It is agreed that Zenith had a long history of placing orders with a third party, MAN, for Microlise products going back to at least 2012. As of 15 August 2015, all of Zenith’s Microlise subscriptions went through MAN. There was no direct contractual relationship between Zenith and Microlise. They state that it is common ground that there were multiple contracts between the parties, and that each of those contracts arose pursuant to a Q/O form. Each Q/O form identified a particular Defendant entity, i.e. Uniserve or JKL. Such identification was not an accident, but rather a specific reflection of the particular counterparty with whom Microlise was contracting with. In my view, the SPSA now neutralises, to a significant extent, this point of specific counterparties, but see my comments at Paragraphs [115-117] below.</p>

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">They highlight that the relationship between Zenith and MAN meant that Zenith was required to continue placing orders through MAN rather than directly with Microlise. This was understood by Zenith as well as Microlise and MAN itself.  They assert that all parties were well aware that only one of the Defendant entities was the contracting party to any particular contract with Microlise, and that if another company in the group benefitted from this, they would cross-charge internally as required. This arrangement did not concern Microlise, which knew who its Q/O contractual counterparty was by looking at the company name on the relevant Q/O Form. Accordingly, the parties to each of the Q/O contracts were Microlise, on the one hand, and only one or other of Uniserve or JKL, on the other hand. The Q/O contracts were not between Microlise and all of the Defendants together or the so-called ‘Uniserve Group’ of 50 or so different entities. In my view, this set of submissions can only be partially correct in the context that the SPSA was in place and overruled the Q/O form General terms.

That Scope document forms part of the contextual commercial background against which the subsequent orders were placed. The objective joint purpose of the parties in contracting was to provide Uniserve with a single telematics solution across its entire fleet of trucks. Microlise was aware, throughout the course of the parties’ dealings, that the Uniserve fleet of trucks was owned by a number of separate entities in the Uniserve Group including Zenith.

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The ‘Customer’ was the entity that was ‘purchasing the equipment’ i.e. who would use it during the lease and own it at the end of the 3-year term. On Orders naming both UHL and JKL at the head of the Q/O form, it was specified that Uniserve would “<span style="font-style:italic">own the hardware at the end of the contract</span>” In that context ‘Uniserve’ meant whichever entity within the Group owned the vehicle onto which the equipment was fitted. More pertinently in this regard, Order SL-021957 contains JKL’s name in the ‘Company’ box, nevertheless it also states that “<span style="font-style:italic">price based on a 3 Year lease term with Uniserve owning the hardware at the end of contract</span>.” They submit that cannot have been a reference to JKL. The Q/O form therefore reflects the intention of the parties that it was the relevant entity within the Uniserve Group (be it Zenith, UHL or JKL) onto which the equipment was to be fitted which was purchasing the equipment, regardless of the particular entity named in the ‘Company’ box. In my view, this submission only has partial force in the context of the SPSA applying. See my comments at paragraphs [115-117] below.</p>

Those companies were collectively referred to by the individuals involved in negotiating, agreeing and operating the Contracts as (variously) the ‘Uniserve Group’ or ‘Uniserve.’  If the Court is with Uniserve on Issue 1, then the SPSA plainly states on its cover sheet and in the recitals that the agreement is between Microlise and the Uniserve Group. Therefore if Uniserve succeeds on Issue 1 it submits that it should also succeed on Issue 2.  Uniserve submits that the Deployment Scope document demonstrates who the parties intended the ‘Customer’ to be, and it is this that elucidates how the ‘defined’ term ‘Customer’ was used in the Order Form T&amp;Cs. In particular it demonstrates that Microlise was aware that Zenith was part of the Uniserve Group and that it owned vehicles within Uniserve’s Fleet. </p>

On that basis, Mr Parratt makes the simple argument that the answer to Issue 2 is self-evident, as the SPSA applies to UHL, JKL and Zenith. That argument carries considerable force, given the application of the SPSA as a framework agreement. However, there are some nuances relating to 1) the point in time that the SPSA applied to each entity and 2) to what Microlise products and services.</p>

I also do not consider that any post 1 February 2016 Zenith orders through MAN (rather than directly with Microlise) would fall within the scope of the SPSA. Specifically, subsequent to 1 February 2016, where Microlise installed non “white label” hardware such as dashcams and forward facing cameras on Zenith trucks, and there were problems with that equipment, then that would fall under the SPSA, absent any applicable and relevant Zenith MAN contract.</p>

            <p class="NumberedPara" style="margin-left:0.39in">This concerns the effect of certain pleaded limitation and/or exclusion clauses. Given my finding on Issue 1, I confine the submissions, law and my ruling to the SPSA. The Claimants submit that three clauses in the SPSA are, under the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1997 (“UCTA”) fair, reasonable and enforceable. Specifically Clause 8.1 relating to contractual warranties, Clause 29.1 relating to an exclusion of certain types of loss, and Clause 29.2 relating to a liability cap of £1m. In contrast, the Defendants in their Case Summary state that if the SPSA applies, they do not seek to construe material terms differently or to imply important terms into that contract. Similarly in their skeleton argument they do not contend that any of terms contained in the SPSA are void or unenforceable. Nevertheless the Defendants seek to restrict the ambit of Clause 29.1. They also state under Clause 29.2 their counterclaim for breach of contract will be limited to £1 million but their claims in misrepresentation are not so limited. By doing so, the Defendants implicitly question the ambit of Clauses 29.1 and 29.2. No objection has been raised by the Defendants to Clause 8.1 of the SPSA.</p>

            <p class="BodyA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I note that recently the Court of Appeal in the case of <span style="font-style:italic">Soteria Insurance Limited (formerly Cis General Insurance Limited) v IBM United Kingdom Limited</span> [2022] EWCA Civ 440 has given guidance as to how a court should approach the interpretation of exclusion clauses in commercial contracts. As with construction of commercial contracts generally, the starting point is the application of the principles in the Supreme Court cases of <span style="font-style:italic">Rainy Sky SA v Kookmin Bank</span> [2011] UKSC 50 at [14]-[30]; <span style="font-style:italic">Arnold v Britton</span> [2015] UKSC 36 at [14]-[22]; and <span style="font-style:italic">Wood v Capita Insurance Services Limited</span> [2017] UKSC 24 at [8]-[15]. The ultimate aim in interpreting a commercial contract is to determine what the parties meant by the language used, which involves ascertaining what a reasonable person would have understood the parties to have meant. The reasonable person is one who has all the background knowledge which would reasonably have been available to the parties in the situation in which they were at the time of the contact. Thereafter the court will have regard to the rules for the construction of exclusion clauses applying the above principals and requirement for sufficient clarity of language. </p>

Mr Naylor also highlights that Uniserve’s own terms and conditions 1) limit its liability by reference to the value of goods and 2) exclude indirect or consequential loss, including loss of profit. A number of similar and/or competitor entities to Microlise (including Samsara, which is the provider apparently used by Uniserve now) also limit their liability and exclude certain types of losses.

Similarly in their skeleton argument they do not contend that any of terms contained in the SPSA are void or unenforceable. Hence their submissions are necessarily limited on this issue. However, they do qualify that view in relation to the ambit of Clauses 29.1 and 29.2. They submit that Clause 29.1 is exclusionary in nature and subject to the strict approach to interpretation. In that context, Uniserve submits that on its true construction this clause purports to exclude liability for indirect/consequential losses of the kind falling within the second limb of <span style="font-style:italic">Hadley v Baxendale</span>.

            <p class="BodyAA" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Whether an exclusion of "consequential loss" catches financial loss such as loss of profits depends on the circumstances of the contract in question. In many cases such losses will be direct (for example where they can ordinarily be expected to flow from a breach) and in some they will be indirect. One approach is to exclude identified, defined categories of loss. Another approach is to incorporate a financial cap. Frequently both approaches will be adopted, as was the case with the SPSA here. Accordingly, my analysis and ruling will be limited to the issue of reasonableness under UCTA of clause 29.1 and 29.2.</p>

Individual orders on the Q/O forms then fell within the terms of the SPSA if those orders had been given by a Uniserve entity. To the extent any Q/O forms were returned by Zenith, then those orders would be subject to the SPSA. Similarly, when JKL was acquired on 22 April 2016, any subsequent Q/O forms by them would be subject to the SPSA. JKL could not have been subject to the SPSA prior to 22 April 2016. Once JKL was acquired, it then fell within the remit of the SPSA. In relation to Zenith, there were known pre-existing contracts with MAN relating to “white-label” Microlise equipment before 1 February 2016. To the extent there were problems with that equipment under those pre-existing contracts, then that would be a contractual matter between Zenith and MAN to which the SPSA would not apply. Any post 1 February 2016 Zenith orders through MAN (rather than directly with Microlise) would not fall within the scope of the SPSA. Subsequent to 1 February 2016, where Microlise installed non “white label” hardware such as dashcams and forward facing cameras on Zenith trucks, and there were problems with that equipment, then that would fall under the SPSA, absent any applicable and relevant Zenith MAN contract.</span></p>
