            <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.57in;margin-right:0.57in">Sunderland City Council has applied for an order committing the Defendant Lioubov Macpherson to prison for contempt of court by breaching injunctive orders made by the court in Court of Protection proceedings on 30 June 2022. The background to the case is set out in detail in my judgment of 30 June 2022, <span style="font-style:italic">SCC v FP and others</span> [2022] EWCOP 30. As set out in that judgment, the Defendant’s daughter, FP is the protected party in Court of Protection proceedings. She is a very vulnerable woman in her early 30’s who was diagnosed with cerebral palsy as a child, suffered meningitis in adulthood, and who now suffers from paranoid schizophrenia. She lacks capacity to make decisions for herself about where she should live, her care, and her contact with others.</p>

There are no similar placements, offering specialist care of the kind that she needs and currently receives, in the vicinity. She would have to move to a new placement in a new area, with a new set of carers. The alternative would be for her to return home to the care of her mother – a situation that previously led to her requiring prolonged in-patient treatment under detention.</p>

All the orders made in the Court of Protection have been made, as required by the Mental Capacity Act 2005, in FP’s best interests.

The Defendant is convinced that FP is not ill and does not have paranoid schizophrenia. It is her firm belief that treating clinicians have caused and continue to cause FP to suffer harm by administering drugs to her that she does not need and that cause her to have the symptoms she exhibits, including her hallucinations, and screaming episodes. There is no evidence to corroborate the Defendant’s beliefs and successive judges in the Court of Protection have found that her beliefs are without foundation, but she maintains them and shows no sign of moderating them. The significant problem is not that the Defendant holds these distorted beliefs but that she acts upon them:</p>

The video records the Defendant saying, “They are hurting you more? They don’t understand that, people around you. They are hurting you more. Tell them… They are hurting you. They are not looking after you. They are insulting you.” FP begins to speak in Russian and the Defendant tells her to speak in English. FP can be heard to say, “They do something to my head…” The Defendant then tells FP that she is distressed and instructs FP to tell “them”. FP then says, “I am very distressed.” The Defendant says, “They are breaking you.”</p>

This remained available for me to read and view on 18 November 2022. The long article is said to be the second part of her daughter’s story. The Defendant refers to FP by name (her first name only) and to “her being mercilessly destroyed by so-called medical professionals, by Social Services, by lawyers and by the court… what happened to the safeguards that were introduced after Dr Shipman’s murders?” The Defendant also writes that “I would like to show the distress that my daughter suffers daily, because so-called professionals keep my daughter in deliberately induced illnesses to suit the agenda that she lacks mental capacity.” She refers to her daughter’s treatment as “torture”. There are a number of videos linked. They include an “interview” by the Defendant of FP. Her face is obscured by blurring. It is edited as can be seen by jumps in the film. The second video film is of an interview with FP by a professional. This is evidence in the Court of Protection proceedings. I have then viewed a further six films linked to the tweet, showing the Defendant on the telephone with FP. In the first, the Defendant puts FP on loudspeaker. FP says that she is not feeling well. The Defendant says, “I think you are in big big danger. Something is going on.” The Defendant begins sobbing. FP then says to someone who must be present with her, “I need a doctor”. The Defendant sobs, “Good girl. Good girl.” In the second FP says that she thinks she is going to be killed that night, “They are going to just kill me.”  In the third the Defendant is holding the phone and FP can be heard screaming uncontrollably. It is a disturbing listen of FP clearly suffering from a severe mental health episode. One of the other videos is the “hospital number 2” video posted on YouTube, referred to above.</p>

Three videos are attached. One is of the Defendant speaking to FP on the phone. FP speaks in Russian, and the Defendant responds in English, “You are not feeling very well.” She asks to speak to the staff. The Defendant says to FP, “I don’t know what’s going on…. Tell me what’s going on please … Why are you so unwell … shall I phone 999?” The carer says that the phone call should end. The second is a video of a face to face contact between the Defendant and her daughter, although all that is shown are people’s feet. It is brief but records the Defendant saying to her daughter, “Are you not happy with me?” FP replies, “Always”.  The third is a very short film of the Defendant showing one of FP’s feet with the Defendant saying, “Look at that. It is just unbelievable.”</p>

It is an “interview” with the Defendant – the same one posted with the article dated ‘1 April’ but FP’s face is not obscured as it was on the version linked to the tweet on 3 November 2022.

I asked whether Ms Turner sought any reports on the Defendant prior to sentencing but she said not. I had in mind the possibility of the court receiving medical evidence about the Defendant if that might be relevant to sentencing. Ms Turner was satisfied that her client had capacity to give instructions. Mr Lewis representing the Defendant today, on 16 January 2023, has not sought any capacity assessment of his client nor any medical reports. On 8 December 2022 I indicated to the Defendant that she had an opportunity before sentencing to abide by the injunctive orders made on 30 June 2022 which remained in force and to take the offending material down from the internet. Prior to the hearing before me today, on 16 January 2023, she has not done so.</p>

No permission was given prior to the applications for committal to dispense with personal service of the orders alleged to have been breached. There has therefore been a procedural defect in relation to the applications to commit. However, given the absence of prejudice to the defendant by reason of the procedural defects, in accordance with the PD21A I waive the procedural defects of failing to serve those orders personally on the defendant.</span></p>

Whilst the general rule is that a Court of Protection hearing will take place in private (r 4.1 of COPR), r 4.3 allows the court to order that a hearing, or part of it, will be heard in public and Practice Direction 4C (entitled 'Transparency') provides at para.2.1 that, unless it appears to the court that there is a good reason not to, the court will "ordinarily" deploy its power under rule 4.3 and order that "any attended hearing shall be in public".

The injunctive orders related to FP’s best interests in respect of her residence, care and contact. For example, if the Defendant uses contact with FP as an opportunity to extract recorded evidence of FP with which to publicise her complaints about her care and treatment, then that is relevant to FP’s best interests in relation to contact with the Defendant. The court is entitled to and did seek to protect FP’s best interests by ordering the Defendant not to record and publicise recordings of FP.</span></p>

The Defendant is entitled to hold those views, but risks causing a deterioration in FP’s mental health were FP to learn of these publications. The evidence is that FP does have access to the internet. Somehow FP has learned of the committal proceedings.</span></p>

Abiding by the Transparency Order in place in the Court of Protection proceedings, the court at Newcastle listed the case using the anonymisation used in those proceedings rather than the Defendant’s full name. I accept the submission made by Mr Lewis on behalf of the Defendant that her full name should have appeared in the list. At that first hearing of the committal applications on 8 December 2022, the case was however listed in public. A member of the press attended. He made submissions that I should allow the Defendant’s name to be reported but I decided on that occasion to extend the Transparency Order to the committal proceedings and to prohibit the naming of FP, her placement, or her relatives, including the Defendant. I considered then that to identify the Defendant would risk identifying FP, her daughter, and that the balance of Article 10 and Article 8 rights weighed in favour of prohibiting the naming of the Defendant. Details about the family, anonymised, are within my published judgment. I considered that were the Defendant to be named in reports of the committal proceedings, it would give rise to a risk that her daughter, FP would be identified and, with her identification, all manner of details about her medical history, her current condition, and personal life would become known to anyone who cared to read both the judgment and reports of the committal proceedings. To allow the Defendant to be named would be to undermine the very orders she was alleged to have breached. Maintaining the Defendant’s anonymity, and thereby protecting FP, appeared to me to be necessary in order to maintain the integrity of the orders the Defendant had admitted she had breached. To allow FP’s anonymity to be lost, or at least jeopardised, would be to grant the Defendant what she had sought to achieve by her contempt of court. In correspondence about the alleged breaches of the injunctive orders, the Defendant wrote, ‘Prison will only make me more determined. At least it will go public then.’ I had to balance rights under Articles 8 and 10 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The view I took was that the restriction on freedom of speech, by reason of not being able to name the Defendant, was a necessary and proportionate restriction in order to protect the Article 8 rights of FP. The power of court to restrict the reporting of the Defendant’s name was provided for by r 21.27 of the COPR 2017 as it was at the time of that hearing. Whilst the 2015 Practice Direction does not expressly allow for such a restriction, it does allow for derogations from the principle of open justice “in exceptional circumstances, when they are strictly necessary as measures to secure the proper administration of justice. Derogations shall, where justified, be no more than strictly necessary to achieve their purpose.” The COPR allowed for the reporting restriction and I regard the ordered restriction as being properly justified at the time that it was made.</span></p>

They expressed concerns that the case had not been listed publicly, but it had been listed in the public list in the court where the hearing took place. The problem appears to be that in Courtserve, a service which allows subscribers to access court lists from around the country, the listing of the case was different from that in the local court. I do not know how that occurred but am aware that it is something that has happened on other occasions. Since journalists, bloggers and observers may rely on Courtserve to access information about cases listed in the Court of Protection and other courts, it is important that the lists on the service match those published by the courts themselves. Mr Farmer and Professor Kitzinger also expressed their disquiet that the Defendant’s identity had  not been allowed to be reported.

Ms Wilson speculates that the crowd funding scheme, organised by the mother with great effect, most probably involved a significant number of small donations rather than a few particularly generous individual benefactors. Ms Wilson reasons from this that many donors might be alerted by the judgment to investigate, by search engine, whether this was the family they gave financial support to. This, it is hypothesised, might lead to a plethora of social media posts which would be difficult to monitor. Ms Wilson also states, that whilst Ms Tickle focuses on the risk to child B by way of "playground taunts" the greater risk probably arises online and insidiously.</p>

He is correct to emphasise the indivisibility of the two. Furthermore, both Ms Tickle and Mr Farmer respectfully suggest that very few members of the public will take the time to seek out and read my actual judgments, relying instead on what they read in the media. I have no doubt, at all, that this is largely true.

However, in relation to contempt of court proceedings, I must have regard to the new r 21.8(5), on the face of which, as it applies to the present contempt proceedings, the court must order that the Defendant’s identity shall not be disclosed if, and only if, it considers non-disclosure necessary to secure the proper administration of justice and in order to protect the interest of the Defendant.  The general power under r 4.2 to impose restrictions on the publication of the identity of any party is circumscribed by r 21.8(5) in relation to contempt of court proceedings.</p>

It does not appear to allow the court to restrict the disclosure of the identity of the Defendant if necessary to secure the administration of justice and to protect the interest of P (here FP). I can envisage cases in which it might be considered that the only way effectively to protect the interest of P is to restrict the disclosure of the identity of another party – the defendant to committal proceedings.

It would be futile for me to try to pretend that this judgment in the committal proceedings does not relate to the individuals who were the subject of my earlier published judgment, but I shall not cause that published judgment to be altered so as to name the Defendant. I do not consider it appropriate for the court to take steps to make it any easier to identify FP. Nevertheless, it is likely that the Open Justice Court of Protection Project, and perhaps other commentators, will wish to write about the committal proceedings in the context of the Court of Protection proceedings. It would be artificial for them to be able to name the Defendant when commenting on the committal proceedings but not to be permitted to name her when commenting on the substantive Court of Protection proceedings. I therefore permit the reporting of the Defendant’s name in relation to the Court of Protection proceedings also and shall amend the Transparency Order accordingly.

I was surprised to read, “Mrs Macpherson searched for a solicitor to take her case on a legal aid basis knowing that there is non-means tested legal aid, but her search was unsuccessful: no solicitor she contacted could take on the case.” As noted, the Defendant was indeed represented by a solicitor on 8 December 2022. That solicitor came off the record because Mrs Macpherson had not subsequently engaged in communications with the firm. It was a further surprise to then read what I understood to be detailed denials of the breaches already admitted by the Defendant, when represented, at the hearing on 8 December 2022.</p>

Whilst the Defendant is alleged to have gone further than before by encouraging people to attend the court building today to protest, no protesters have attended. The other alleged breaches are very similar to the previously alleged breaches. The Claimant has already alleged eleven breaches over a period of some weeks. Inevitably the further application, made so close to the hearing on 16 January 2023 would, if continued, lead to delay in concluding the applications heard and then adjourned on 8 December 2022.</p>

The committal proceedings therefore concern only the first three applications and the five admitted breaches referred to above.</p>

It is difficult for the Defendant to keep track of the allegations against her. It involves duplication of work. It causes or risks delay in making determinations. If a contempt of court has been committed it should be dealt with expeditiously where possible. If a further breach of a different or much more serious nature has been allegedly committed since the onset of the original committal proceedings then there might be a case for bringing a further application but, otherwise, an Claimant should consider very carefully the utility of making a series of applications. Here, I cannot see that it was necessary or proportionate to make the most recent application.</p>

He contended that the orders were not lawfully made. The difficulty with that submission is that Mrs Macpherson sought permission to appeal all the orders made on 30 June 2022, including the injunctive orders, and permission to appeal was refused by the Court of Appeal as being totally without merit.

The Claimant’s concern was with the five admitted breaches which involved posting recordings of FP and, at the same time, revealing her identity. Accordingly, those other six alleged breaches should not have been included in the applications to commit. As for the five alleged breaches set out above, I am satisfied that they were deliberate, the Defendant knew she was breaching clear court orders when she committed those breaches, and the breaches were serious. They were serious in that the Defendant’s conduct was contumelious and they were serious in relation to the impact and the potential impact on FP. They involved a significant invasion of her privacy and they involved manipulation of a vulnerable person who is the subject of Court of Protection proceedings. Mr Lewis did not seek to persuade the court that these five breaches did not each constitute a contempt of court. I am satisfied that each of the admitted breaches set out above did constitute a contempt of court. I proceed to sentence the Defendant on that basis.</p>

The Defendant manipulates conversations with her vulnerable daughter and feeds her the line that she is being harmed by those caring for her and by her medication. Since FP has paranoid schizophrenia and believes she is being persecuted, the line fed to her by the Defendant is particularly dangerous to the mental health of her daughter. However, it is the conversations themselves that are most harmful to FP, not the posting of recordings of those conversations online. I have seen no evidence that FP is herself aware of the fact that her conversations have been shown to others by publication online. FP may not even be aware that her telephone conversations have been recorded. She will be aware that she was filmed being “interviewed” by the Defendant but there is no evidence that she knows what the Defendant did with that film. Accordingly, I proceed on the basis that there is no evidence that the admitted breaches have caused FP harm.</span></p>

              <p class="CoverText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.57in"><span style="text-decoration-line:none">The Defendant has chosen directly to challenge the authority of the court. She has shown no respect for the court orders she has breached. She appears to take pride in having committed those breaches. She stands in defiance of the court and is bent on waging a campaign to bring attention to her views about her daughter’s treatment and care. Her views have no foundation in fact. They are bizarre. The Defendant has maintained them in the face of clear evidence that they are wrong. I have no evidence that the defendant’s thinking is affected by illness. Her views may well be sincerely held but that does not justify her acting on them in the way she has, in deliberate breach of court orders designed to prevent harm to her daughter and unjustified interference with her daughter’s human rights.</span></p>

Accordingly, links to those recordings on Twitter will not be effective. I am grateful that the Defendant has done so. She has had ample time to do so before today but nevertheless her actions today are a significant mitigating factor. They give the court some grounds for believing that the Defendant will not post similar recordings of FP in the future, in particular if the consequences of doing so are clear to her.</span></p>

She lives with her husband who has disabilities and she cares for him. The household income comprises benefits most of which are directed to providing care for him. Nor does the Defendant have any savings or realisable assets. Surprisingly she has taken a loan in order to pay for legal representation today when she was entitled to publicly funded legal representation. However, imposing a fine on the Defendant would risk setting her up to fail because she has no income of her own from which to pay a fine.</span></p>

              <p class="CoverText" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.57in"><span style="text-decoration-line:none">In this case the Defendant has almost dared the court to send her to prison because she believes it will bring attention to her bizarre views. However, to imprison the Defendant could well cause harm to others, both to the Defendant’s husband, FP’s stepfather, who has health issues and is aged 74 and who is looked after at home by the Defendant, and to FP herself. It seems to me very likely that FP would learn that her mother had been imprisoned by the court. The evidence of Mr Salmon shows that by whatever means, FP has been informed of the committal proceedings. It is very likely that FP would be informed if her mother was indeed imprisoned and this would be upsetting to FP whose mental state is of course fragile. The knowledge that the Defendant had been imprisoned would risk exacerbating FP’s paranoia and fear of persecution. Her understanding of why she has been removed from her mother appears to be limited. Her understanding of why her mother had been imprisoned may well also have limitations. I have to bear in mind that imprisoning the Defendant could well do FP more harm than the breaches themselves.</span></p>

If she is imprisoned for her deliberate and repeated breaches of court orders designed to protect her daughter, the fact of the imprisonment may well cause distress to the very person the court has sought to protect. A sanction other than imprisonment risks sending a signal to the Defendant and to others that the court will tolerate deliberate breaches of its orders.</span></p>

Weighing all the relevant circumstances I am satisfied that the only sentence that is appropriate in this case is one of imprisonment. Nothing else would meet the seriousness of the Defendant’s contempt of court. However, given the mitigating factors referred to above, in my judgment the appropriate length of sentence is one of 28 days, concurrent for each admitted allegation of contempt. Further, the circumstances of this case are such that immediate imprisonment is not justified. The imposition of immediate imprisonment would be harmful to the Defendant’s husband and, most importantly, to FP. The fact that the Defendant has removed the recordings of FP from the internet, albeit belatedly, allows me to pass a suspended sentence. The sentence of the court for each of the five admitted contempts of court is one of 28 days imprisonment, to run concurrently, suspended for 12 months, that is until midnight on 15 January 2024 on condition that the Defendant does not during those 12 months, conduct herself in any court proceedings in such a way as to be found in contempt of court.</span></p>
