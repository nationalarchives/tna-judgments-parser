            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This Judgment concerns a disputed winding up petition, presented on 17 December 2021 pursuant to section 122(1)(f) of the Insolvency Act 1986 against DCBX Limited, being a company incorporated on 17 August 2012 under the Companies Act 2006 with registration number 08184268 (the “<span style="font-weight:bold">Company</span>”) by Hex Technologies Limited (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Technologies</span>”), Hex Trust Limited (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Trust</span>”) and Hex Technologies Pte Limited (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Technologies Pte</span>”).  For convenience and where appropriate to do so, I shall refer to the 3 petitioning companies, Technologies, Trust and Technologies Pte, together as “<span style="font-weight:bold">HEX</span>” or “<span style="font-weight:bold">the Petitioners</span>”.  By the Petition, HEX claim that the Company owes to them a total debt of £108,765.15 (comprising principal of £96,184.33 – converted from USD 131,759.36 – and interest of £12,580.81, as at 9 November 2021), such sums having been invoiced pursuant to 4 different contractual agreements entered into by the Company.  A statutory demand claiming such sums and accompanied by the requisite Condition B Notice dated 10 November 2021 was served upon the Company on that date.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Petition was served upon the Company on 17 December 2021, by leaving it with the receptionist at the Company’s registered office address in London.  Although the Company takes issue with the method of service in circumstances where the receptionist was not an employee of the Company, it was served in accordance with the requirements of the Insolvency Rules by being deposited at the registered office in such a way that it was likely to come to the notice of a person attending the office (in compliance with paragraph 2(2) of Schedule 4) and it obviously came to the attention of the Company’s director, Mr Angelo, as he has filed various witness statements in opposition to the Petition.  The Petition was duly advertised on 12 January 2022, identifying the Company’s present and its recent former names (LDX EFOLIO Limited and London Derivatives Exchange Limited).  The Petition was first heard on 2 February 2022, when directions for the filing of evidence were made by ICC Judge Barber.</p>

Given the limited time, it was not possible to determine the Petition on that occasion.  However, in light of various submissions made on behalf of the parties at that hearing, I gave permission for the parties to rely on further evidence which they had each filed and served the previous day and gave further permission for the Company to file and serve further evidence to be strictly limited to evidence in response to the further witness statement of Mr Paul Bagon dated 11 July which had been served on behalf of the Petitioners.</p>

                <p class="ParaLevel3" style="margin-left:1.48in">A further witness statement of Mr Bagon dated 11 July 2022 together with Exhibit PB2 which was filed following receipt of the skeleton argument on behalf of the Company for the hearing on 12 July 2022.  Its particular purpose was, as it stated, to rebut an assertion made on behalf of the Company that there was only one active custodian account with a particular third party which I shall refer to for convenience (as did the parties) as <span style="font-weight:bold">SGH.  </span> Exhibit PB2 contained various documents which HEX wished to rely upon that had been redacted to remove reference to details of account holders.  Such redactions had been made (so it was said) to protect confidential information in relation to such persons from being on the Court file and, at the hearing on 12 July 2022, I gave permission for HEX to rely upon such material upon their solicitors’ undertaking to provide to the Company’s solicitors an unredacted copy of such exhibit in advance of the hearing, leaving open the question of whether it might be necessary for the Court to be referred to any unredacted versions of such documents and, if so, whether it might be appropriate to make any order restricting public access to such materials.   In the event, the parties considered it unnecessary for the Court to be referred to any unredacted versions of any documents contained in Exhibit PB2 and accordingly they were never placed on the Court file and it was not necessary to consider whether any confidentiality order could or should be made in relation to any unredacted copies of such documents.  </p>

At the end of the full day’s hearing and it being necessary to reserve judgment in any event, I gave the parties permission to provide (and their respective advocates duly provided) further written submissions limited to a point that the Company wished to make (and that HEX wished to refute) which had not been possible to address properly at the hearing due to deficiencies in the contents of the authorities bundle.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Thereafter and prior to circulating draft judgment, Ms Jones quite properly wrote to the Court (copied to Ms Anwar) to draw attention to the existence of a recent <span style="font-style:italic">ex tempore</span> judgment of ICC Judge Prentis which was adverse to her clients’ position (concerning the relevance of any exclusive jurisdiction clause) and making some submissions in relation to the same.  In view of such correspondence in December, rather than circulating draft judgment to the parties, I gave the Company an opportunity to respond in writing and Ms Anwar duly filed a written response on 16 January 2023.  However, a copy of the approved transcript of such Judgment of ICC Judge Prentis (<span style="font-style:italic">Ghanim Saad M Al Saad Al Kuwari v Cantervale Limited</span> [2022] EWHC 3490 (Ch)) did not become available to the parties and the Court until 30 January 2023.  Consequently, on 3 February 2023, I gave directions for the parties to provide to the Court and each other by 13 February 2023, any written submissions which they wished to make in consequence of the judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Al Saad</span>, including in relation to the construction and effect of any jurisdiction clause sought to be relied upon, and for the parties to provide to the Court and to each other by 20 February 2023 any written submissions in reply.  Notwithstanding my plea to the parties to endeavour to keep such written submissions short, I have received a further 35 pages of written submissions and an additional bundle of authorities comprising 293 pages.  In view of the novelty and potential importance of the issue which has arisen (which I address below), I make no criticism of the parties for such length, but I note that it has increased the time required to further consider the matter and give this Judgment.  I also note that, not least given their overall length, it is neither possible nor desirable to address each and every point raised in the various written and oral arguments advanced by the parties.  However, I have considered all of the parties’ oral and written submissions for the purposes of giving this Judgment.</p>

Some of the clients were individuals and some were incorporated bodies.  In each case, Recital (C) stated, “<span style="font-style:italic">The Client wishes to appoint the Custodian to provide custodial services, LDX wishes to pay the Fees to the Custodian on behalf of the Client for the provision of custodial services, and the Custodian is willing to perform such services on the terms and conditions contained in this Agreement.</span>”</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Petitioners do not rely on any invoices after 7 July 2020 as they accept that the relationship between HEX and the Company came to an end at the end of July.  Although there is a dispute between the parties as to whether it should have ceased to continue doing so earlier, it is not disputed that HEX provided the Company with the licence and the services contracted for under the various written agreements referred to above and invoiced for the same.  Although there was a tentative suggestion made by Ms Anwar in her oral submissions that, <span style="font-style:italic">if</span> all of the Company’s other grounds of opposition to the Petition failed, it <span style="font-style:italic">might</span> take issue with the extent of any services provided and invoiced for, this was not a point which was taken by the Company in its evidence (or in the skeleton argument).  Given the tenor and volume of the evidence and argument filed in opposition to the Petition, if there was any dispute about the provision of services or the quantum or computation of any of the sums invoiced pursuant to the written agreements (as opposed to the Company’s argument that they should not be regarded as payable by the Company at all and/or that it was not appropriate to present a winding up petition for other reasons), it would have been raised by Mr Angelo in his witness statements in opposition to the Petition.  In particular, it would have been raised by him both at the outset and in any event following receipt of the Petitioners’ skeleton argument for the hearing on 12 July which clearly stated in its introduction that the Company did not dispute that it entered into the relevant agreements, that the services were provided by HEX and that, absent some terminating event, the amounts claimed were prima facie due.  No issue has therefore been taken by the Company with the computation or quantum of any of the amounts invoiced referable to the services provided; the issues raised by the Company are whether they should have been invoiced for at all in circumstances where Mr Angelo claims that the Company had sought to terminate the written agreements (such that HEX ought to have ceased continuing to provide the relevant services) at an earlier date and/or that the Company should not be liable to pay such sums because of default by SGH.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel2" style="margin-left:0.98in">However, I am not satisfied that the monthly payments of USD 833.00 invoiced in respect of “<span style="font-style:italic">Enterprise Custody Account”</span> were, as Mr Quaglini stated in his evidence, due “<span style="font-style:italic">pursuant to the Engagement Letter</span>”.  In her oral submissions, Ms Jones explained that despite the reference in Schedule B to the USD 10,000 “<span style="font-style:italic">support fee</span>” being payable annually in advance, it was this figure which was being invoiced on a monthly basis in equal instalments of USD 833.00.  However, and although this was not a point taken by the Company, the description does not obviously correspond with the services and fees specified in the Engagement Letter and Schedule B clearly provided that both the implementation fee and the support fee were to be payable either “<span style="font-style:italic">up front</span>” or “<span style="font-style:italic">in advance”</span>.   I also note that the statement of account provided by HEX shows that on 26 June and 29 August 2019 the Company made 2 payments to HEX of USD 10,000 in relation to an earlier invoice issued in February 2019.  This would suggest that the implementation fee and the support fee referred to in the Engagement Letter were, as specified, paid up front or in advance.  </p>

In particular, I take account of the fact that both Singapore and Hong Kong are common law jurisdictions and that the issues which arise are essentially issues of contractual construction and factual operation (there being no dispute that the agreements I have identified above were entered into by the parties) and that the underlying documents were drafted in the English language.</p>

Nevertheless, the Company’s position is that in view of the restrictions which applied in the period from 1 March 2020 to 30 September 2021, Parliament must have intended that subsequent petitions could not be presented in respect of any debts which had arisen either before or during the previously prescribed relevant period unless the condition previously prescribed by paragraph 2(2) and 5 was met.  In other words, the Company’s submission was that upon the removal of such restrictions by the enactment of the present version of Schedule 10, Parliament could not have intended that statutory demands and winding up petitions could be presented by reference to debts which had arisen before or during the period of such restrictions if coronavirus had had a financial effect on the company – and the Company contended that it had been severely affected by coronavirus.  </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, this submission as put overlooks the nature of winding up proceedings.  They are not a means of enforcing a debt, rather they are a class remedy to be pursued for the benefit of all creditors where a company is unable to pay its debts.  Nevertheless, it is trite law that it is an abuse of process to bring or pursue a winding up petition in respect of a debt which is bona fide disputed on substantial grounds.  Conversely, as I have noted above, it is well established that for the purposes of section 123(1)(a) and (e), failure to pay a debt (or such part of the debt) which is above the statutory threshold and not disputed in good faith and on substantial grounds suffices to evidence inability to pay debts as they fall due; see<span style="font-style:italic"> Re Taylor’s Industrial Flooring Ltd</span> [1990] BCC 44 at 48H-51B, citing, amongst other authorities, <span style="font-style:italic">Re Cornhill Insurance Plc v Improvement Services Ltd </span> [1986] 1 WLR 114.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Accordingly, the issue for the Court is not whether the Company has provided evidence of solvency but whether the debts claimed are bona fide disputed on substantial grounds.  If they are not, the fact that they are unpaid is itself evidence of the Company’s insolvency.  Nevertheless, in view of the repeated emphasis which the Company placed upon its asserted solvency, both in respect of this and its subsequent grounds, I make the following observations in relation to the evidence sought to be relied upon:</p>

No accounts were put forward in order to demonstrate its asserted financial position whatsoever.  Instead, the position taken by the Company appears to have been that having asserted through its director that it was solvent and having not understood the Petitioners to take issue with that (being a position I find difficult to comprehend given the nature of the proceedings) it did not need to produce such evidence.</p>

Notwithstanding such stated purpose, it referred to and relied upon only the following:</p>

              <content>
                <p class="ParaLevel7" style="margin-left:1.28in">2 letters said to be expressing financial support for the Company with accompanying bank statements in relation to their respective accounts.  However, one of these letters dated 21 December 2021 was written by Mr Angelo on behalf of a company called LDXAM Limited which was said to be confirming an offer to purchase the shares in the Company and to “<span style="font-style:italic">reasonably support [the Company] in its current dispute with Hex Trust Limited Hong Kong, until such time as it deems the support no longer financially beneficial to LDXAM”</span>.  Little if any comfort could be taken by the Company or the court from the terms of this letter.  Furthermore, whilst a Coutts bank statement for LDXAM Limited was produced showing a balance as at 10 January 2022 of £275,018.79, this included an unexplained transfer from the Company to which I refer below and a subsequent statement for the same account exhibited to Ms Anwar’s statement of 16 February 2022 appears to show a reduced balance as at 15 February 2022 of £125,018.79 and there was no evidence as to LDXAM Limited’s own liabilities.   The second letter relied upon was also written by Mr Angelo but dated 5 July 2022 and written on behalf of Inspira Wealth SA.  Such letter also supposedly confirmed an offer to purchase the shares in the Company from the existing shareholder and to provide “<span style="font-style:italic">financial support … for such time as Inspira Wealth Limited and Inspira Wealth SA deem to be necessary”</span>.  Again, whilst a Coutts bank statement as at 4 July 2022 appears to confirm funds held by “<span style="font-style:italic">Inspira Wealth Switzerland”</span> of £933,699.00 little if any comfort could be taken by the Company or the court from the terms of such letter and there was no evidence as to that entity’s own liabilities.  Accordingly, whilst I accept Ms Anwar’s submission that as a matter of principle it is possible for a company to demonstrate that it is able to pay its debts as and when they fall due by reference to ongoing financial support from another entity, the evidence sought to be relied upon by the Company in this respect falls far short of establishing what would be required to reach such a conclusion in the present case.</p>

This therefore appears to have been a payment made on account of costs, and by the time of the hearing before me the Company had served a schedule of costs with a total which greatly exceeded this sum and there was no evidence as to whether such costs had already been paid by the Company and, if not, how any of them were intended to be met.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Whilst the various separate written agreements all related to the same business venture between Hex and the Company (namely the provision of the services envisaged in the Engagement Letter), notwithstanding Ms Anwar’s attempts to persuade me otherwise, in my judgment it is plain that, in contrast to the facts under consideration in <span style="font-style:italic">Cinnamon European Structured Credit Master Fund v Banco Commerical Properties SA,</span> they were all entered into by the Company as separate and distinct contractual agreements.  In <span style="font-style:italic">Cinnamon European Structured Credit Master Fund v Banco Commerical Properties SA</span> the 2 documents together set out the contractual arrangements which governed the terms of the purchases of the relevant Notes and it was artificial to regard them as wholly free-standing documents, operating independently of one another.  In that case, both had been entered into on the same day, between the same parties, concerned the same subject matter, neither could be given effect to without reference to the other, were inextricably linked as a matter of commercial reality, both contained English choice of law clauses and only the purchase agreement contained a jurisdiction clause.  In the present case, each of the documents relied upon comprised a standalone contract, envisaged and capable of operating in accordance with its own terms.  Moreover, as I have set out above, each of them had their own choice of law, jurisdiction and, crucially, entire agreement clauses.  I therefore do not consider there to be merit in the Company’s position that, notwithstanding their own express terms, each of the Engagement Letter, the Software Licence Agreement, the Company Custodian Agreement and the separate Client Custodian Agreements, as Ms Anwar put it in her skeleton argument, “<span style="font-style:italic">consisted of a single suite of contracts</span>” and/or together “<span style="font-style:italic">form[ed] the same overarching Agreement”</span>.  Whilst I accept Ms Anwar’s submission that contracting parties can enter into interconnecting agreements which may fall to be construed together, the fallacy of such proposition applying in relation to the written agreements relied upon in the present case is higlighted by the following material facts:-</p>

The Chancellor rejected the submission that section 9 of the Arbitration Act 1996 (which essentially provides that a party to an arbitration agreement against whom legal proceedings are brought in respect of any matter which is to be referred to arbitration may apply to the court for such proceedings to be stayed, and that such stay shall be granted unless the court is satisfied that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed) applied directly to winding up proceedings so as to require the Petition to be stayed or dismissed.  Nevertheless, the Chancellor held (at [39]) that as section 122(1) of the Insolvency Act 1986 confers on the court a discretionary power to wind up a company, “<span style="font-style:italic">the court should, save in wholly exceptional circumstances, which I presently find difficult to envisage, exercise its discretion consistently with the legislative policy embodied in the 1996 Act”.</span></p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As the intention of the legislature in enacting in the 1996 Act had been to exclude the court’s jurisdiction to give summary judgment, which had not previously been excluded under the Arbitration Act 1975, the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Salford Estates</span> considered that it would be anomalous, in the circumstances, for the companies’ court to conduct a summary judgment type analysis of liability for an unadmitted debt, on which a petition was grounded, when the creditor had agreed to refer any dispute relating to the debt to arbitration.  In reaching such conclusion, the Court noted that the exercise of the companies’ court’s discretion “<span style="font-style:italic">otherwise than consistently with the policy underlying the 1996 Act would inevitably encourage parties to an arbitration agreement – as a standard tactic – to by-pass the arbitration agreement and the 1996 Act by presenting a winding up petition”,</span> which would be “<span style="font-style:italic">entirely contrary to the parties’ agreement as to the proper forum for the resolution of such an issue and to the legislative policy of the 1996 Act”</span>.   The debt relied upon in the petition fell within the wide terms of the arbitration agreement and was not admitted, which would, in ordinary civil proceedings, trigger the automatic stay provision in section 9 of the 1996 Act irrespective of the merits of any defence.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeal held that as a matter of the exercise of the court’s discretion under section 122(1)(f) of the Insolvency Act the petition ought to have been dismissed, compelling the parties to resolve their dispute over the debt by their chosen method of dispute resolution rather than the court being required to investigate whether or not the debt was bona fide disputed on substantial grounds.</p>

Having considered the matter carefully, I respectfully disagree.  I accept that it would be open to argument at appellate level that, when considering a petition based on a debt falling within the ambit of an exclusive jurisdiction clause, the Companies Court ought to exercise its discretion pursuant to section 122(1)(f) in a manner which would be consistent with the now established exercise of its discretion in relation to debts subject to arbitration agreements.   However, with due deference to ICC Judge Prentis, I do not consider that there is an irreconcilable conflict between <span style="font-style:italic">BST Properties Limited </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Salford Estates</span> and, as such, pending further consideration of the relevant issue by the Court of Appeal I consider that I am bound to follow <span style="font-style:italic">BST Properties Limited</span>.  In particular, notwithstanding ICC Judge Prentis’ conclusion that arbitration agreements and exclusive jurisdiction clauses are, for these purposes, a distinction without a difference, in my judgment <span style="font-style:italic">BST Properties Limited </span>and <span style="font-style:italic">Salford Estates</span> can presently be distinguished on the basis that <span style="font-style:italic">Salford Estates</span> was decided by reference to the legislative policy of the 1996 Act, which differed materially from the prior Arbitration Act, whereas there is no equivalent legislative policy in relation to exclusive jurisdiction clauses to inform the exercise of the court’s discretion.  Accordingly, unless and until <span style="font-style:italic">BST Properties Limited</span> is reconsidered by the Court of Appeal, I consider that I should follow it and therefore, notwithstanding the existence of any exclusive jurisdiction clause, proceed to determine whether the claimed debts upon which the Petition is disputed are bona fide disputed on substantial grounds.  </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my judgment, there is no merit in the Company’s claim that the Client Custodian Agreements and/or the Software License Agreement and the Company Custodian Agreement were frustrated by any non-payment to the Company by SGH.   The Software License Agreement and the Company Custodian Agreement were free-standing contractual arrangements between the Company and Technologies Pte and the Company and Trust respectively, under which the Company was obliged to pay for the services which it contracted to be provided with.  As regards the Client Custodian Agreements, only one of these directly involved SGH.  Whilst it appeared to be common ground that the other Clients were in some way associated with or investors in SGH, and that digital tokens in the wallets had initially been provided by SGH, the payment obligations which fell upon the Company pursuant to the Client Custodian Agreements were not dependent upon the performance of any payment obligations by SGH (or others).  The Company’s position was that its role under the Client Custodian Agreements was merely one of facilitation; being obliged only to pass on to Trust payments which it received from clients without it having any independent liabilities.  However, that was plainly not what the terms of the Client Custodian Agreements which I have set out in paragraphs 17 to 19 above provided for.   Under the terms which were agreed, the Company clearly promised to pay the Fees on behalf of the Clients on an unconditional basis. Effectively, the Company indemnified Trust in the event of default by the Clients, an arrangement which made objective commercial sense in terms of allocation of risk.  Essentially, the Company’s position now is that it made a bad bargain but it is not the role of the Court to rewrite its terms.  The fact that even the Company recognised that its payment obligations under the Client Custodian Agreements were not contingent upon receipt from the corresponding Client is also evidenced by the fact that in various WhatsApp communications during March 2020 between Mr Angelo and Mr Quaglini, Mr Angelo repeatedly made reference to the Company seeking investment in response to Mr Quaglini’s requests for payment.</p>

Although, by his email of 8 September 2020, Mr Angelo claimed that previously the “<span style="font-style:italic">service was cancelled in writing”</span>, Ms Anwar was not able to point to any communication other than the email of 23 June 2020 which the Company relied upon for those purposes. Indeed, it was no doubt for this reason that at the hearing the Company contended for an implied term enabling it to give “<span style="font-style:italic">verbal notice with a reasonable period”</span>.  However, I can see no basis for implying such a term. In my judgment, the commercial expectation given the relevant business environment and consistent with the overall terms of the agreements, would be for any such communication to be required to be given in written form.   </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">It is further alleged by the Company that the Petition has been pursued with an ulterior motive, namely for the purposes of causing reputational damage to the Company and/or Mr Angelo and to put the Company out of business.  However, as I have noted above, the Company confirmed in correspondence sent to the Petitioners’ solicitors on 2 December 2021 prior to the presentation of the Petition (on 17 December 2021) that it did not have any assets and had already “<span style="font-style:italic">effectively ceased trading”</span>.  Moreover, even if (which I do not find to be the case) the Petitioners were in part motivated to pursue the Petition by malice, it remains the case that the Petition was well founded and I was not taken to any authority to suggest that such motivation should prevent the Court from making a winding up order.  Instead, the Company’s submissions that the Petition was brought with malicious intent were premised on its case (which I have rejected) that the proceedings were without merit. </p>
