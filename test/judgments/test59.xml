The success of the ville morte action in bringing much of Kinshasa to a standstill in January 2005 has threatened the Kabila leadership. We accept Mr Kennes' evidence that UDPS militants abroad returning now would be at risk of detention. There is a much lesser risk for PALU members although this changes from time to time. According to Mr Kennes they tend to be released more easily than UDPS members. There is a potential risk for DPS members who are considered to be potential and actual collaborators or spies for Bemba and his MLC movement. The danger for high ranking MPR officials and their families has considerably diminished since the creation of the Transitional Government and depends on the position of persons held under the Mobutu regime. Those involved or believed to be involved in the assassination of President Kabila continue to be at risk of imprisonment and torture. The immigration and security services are still convinced that only part of the network that planned the assassination has been discovered and arrested.”</span></p>

We do not burden this decision with a recital of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, Article 3 ECHR, and the relevant immigration rules. For present purposes it is now well established that the treatment of country guidance as a presumption of fact means that it is for the parties seeking to persuade the Tribunal to depart from it, to adduce the evidence justifying a departure.  An assessment as to whether to depart from a CG decision is to be undertaken as to: (i) whether material circumstances have changed; and (ii) whether such changes are well established evidentially and durable. </p>

The purpose of those missions in 2019 was to collect as much information as possible on the new regime of President Tshisekedi. Dr Kodi wanted to assess whether the new regime’s practices in terms of upholding human rights, freedom of speech, freedom of association and the rights of the opposition parties were different from those of the previous regime.  Dr Kodi told us in his oral evidence that through his work as an academic and as a manager in Continental and International Investigations, he maintains contacts in academic and government circles. </p>

Dr Kodi states that while the conflict was at the beginning locally rooted in the Central Kasai Province, it quickly spread to the surrounding Kasai, Kasai-Oriental and Lomami Provinces. The fighting between various factions and the brutal repression by the State security forces has destroyed the already weak infrastructure, whole villages and their fields. In order to flee from destitution and famine, hundreds and thousands of people have migrated mainly to the Kwilu, Kwango and Kinshasa provinces in the west, as well as to the richer Katanga region. The arrival of displaced people has made an already difficult humanitarian situation in many of these provinces, even worse.</p>

However, well informed observers of the political scene in the DRC, including Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and the US State Department note that a large number of demonstrations have taken place in Kinshasa and the rest of the country, and have been dispersed with disproportionate violence by the national State security forces since President Tshisekedi was inaugurated in January 2019.  </p>

Dr Kodi said that in spite of the change of leadership in the DRC there has been a deterioration in terms of the serious human rights violations committed by national security forces and militias in the country. This is due to the fact that there is no change but continuity in the leadership of the security forces, as former President Kabila’s appointees continue to hold key positions in these institutions and have proven to be beholden to him.  </p>

According to media reports, Ardent Kabambi’s wife has claimed the arrest was ordered by François Beya, the Special Adviser to President Tshisekedi, and former Director-General of DGM.  Dr Kodi states François Beya’s services might have provided the video to the judges.</p>

Dr Kodi states he has no concerns about the reliability of UR III and in his view, Catherine Ramos used a sound methodology in her research and in writing up the results of her research.  </p>

              <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Kodi said<span style="color:#0070C0"> </span>that immigration officials and human rights activists he interviewed while doing research for his reports, reported that they had witnessed or were informed about cases of returnees.  Each one of them separately advised that they knew of between 2 and 18 cases of arrests since January 2019. They, however, declined to share the names of the returnees for fear of reprisals for themselves and the returnees.  He said that in November 2020, APARECO warned its members about 200 spies who had been recruited in the Congolese diaspora by the ANR to report on the activities of APARECO and other opposition parties abroad.  The very popular YouTube channel TeleTshangu123 announced on 3 December 2020 that they had been informed that two Congolese who had returned on holiday to the DRC were arrested on arrival in Kinshasa. According to their relatives, the two arrested returnees were told by the ANR agents who arrested them that they had been informed about their anti-Tshisekedi activities and of their return flight by a UDPS member who had returned to work for President Tshisekedi’s Office. Dr Kodi claims the continued monitoring of the Congolese diaspora by the Congolese authorities is evidenced by comments or threats made following political discussions or criticisms of President Tshisekedi and his government on the diaspora’s numerous social media channels. Dr Kodi claims the social media forums on which these discussions take place make it easier for the Congolese national intelligence agencies to monitor the diaspora, and especially political opposition parties.</p>

The two individuals had been recommended by a friend of Dr Kodi who taught them at the University of Kinshasa and who had known them for many years.  Dr Kodi said that his friend whom gave him the names of the immigration officials, is a trustworthy person who he has known since secondary school.  He did not therefore need to double-check the identities of the immigration officials.  He asked them about the redocumentation process of failed asylum seekers and the role of the DGM Attaché to the DRC Embassy in London.  Dr Kodi refers to the questions he asked and summarises their response:</p>

Therefore, by the time the returnee FNO arrives in Kinshasa, this information is already in the hands of the DGM staff at Ndjili airport.</p>

              <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">Finally, Dr Kodi considered<span style="color:#0070C0"> </span>material from a specialist in African affairs working for the US Congressional Research Service relating to the possibility of the survival of President Tshisekedi’s coalition in the lead-up to the next elections in December 2023. Dr Kodi states there are signs that the next few months will see the dislocation of the Sacred Union coalition that President Tshisekedi has succeeded in putting in place with a majority made up of defectors from President Kabila’s FCC.  He refers to Moise Katumbi having already announced his intention to stand in the Presidential election in 2023.  Dr Kodi refer to the steps taken by President Tshisekedi to disqualify Moise Katumbi from running in the presidential election by tabling a bill in Parliament which would exclude all candidates who do not have a Congolese parent.  Moise Katumbi, whose father was originally from Cyprus, would not therefore be eligible for the top office in the country.  Dr Kodi states that in a move that clearly indicates a final break between President Tshisekedi and Moise Katumbi, the latter has recently reconciled with former President Joseph Kabila and most of the political leaders of the former Katanga Province.</p>

              <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Kodi states<span style="color:#0070C0"> </span>that although President Tshisekedi has succeeded in placing his loyal allies in key positions in the institutions that will run, announce and confirm the provisional results of the elections, (i.e. the National Independent Electoral Committee (CENI) and the Constitutional Court), President Tshisekedi does not appear confident about his hold on power and there is evidence of nervousness in the presidential camp. Dr Kodi states the fear of losing fair and transparent presidential and parliamentary elections because of the mounting unpopularity of the President and his regime, has led the incumbent and his allies to the same tactics as the former President as noted by a Professor at the University of Mons in Belgium who was interviewed by the Research Directorate, Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada. The Professor observed that President Tshisekedi’s regime has adopted the “logic of Kabila’s government whereby non-supporters of the regime who raise sensitive issues are subjected to repression.”.  Dr Kodi states similar observations have been made by Cardinal Ambongo and Joseph Olengankoy.  Both of them were subjected to retaliation by members of the UDPS, and other entities close to the President.</p>

              <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Kodi also notes the security situation in the Eastern provinces of the DRC was dire last year (2021), prompting President Tshisekedi to call on the President of Uganda, Yoweri Museveni, to send troops to help defeat the numerous militia that roam the Ituri, North and South Kivu Provinces. Dr Kodi states that neither the state of siege declared in the region, nor the assistance of the Ugandan troops have succeeded in reducing the threat of the militias but have been used by the regime as an excuse to crush all dissenting voices in the region.  Dr Kodi states that on the contrary, according to observers, the situation has significantly worsened, with more civilians being killed and displaced within and outside the country since the state of siege was declared in March 2021.</p>

He said that he does not consider himself to be a human rights advocate despite his professional career including a substantial period working for Amnesty International and Transparency International.  He said his views are not unduly impacted by his previous experience in human rights advocacy, but are informed by that experience.</p>

He accepts there are regional variations and the position in the east of the country is different to the position in the west.  He accepted the mineral reserves are in the east of the country and that is where much of the ongoing violence and human rights violations occur.  He acknowledged there has been a state of siege in the area that is extended every 15 days.  It was put to Dr Kodi that there were not only more human rights violations in the east, but about 90% of the violations occur in the conflict areas.  He said the east is the area that is the most monitored but accepted that is where the vast majority of human rights violations take place.</p>

He accepted that although President Tshisekedi and his ally, the Deputy Speaker of the National Assembly had to convene meetings with the “rebels” to promise them positions in the State enterprises and in key jobs, that is part and parcel of ‘politics’.  He said that what was untoward here, is that ‘bribery’ was used, albeit, he accepted, he was unable to point to any hard evidence of that.  Dr Kodi agreed President Tshisekedi has a Prime Minister allied to the UDPA and now controls a number of the key ministries including, the Interior, Finance and Defence such that the political landscape has been reshaped.  </p>

              <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Hansen referred Dr Kodi to the scepticism he had expressed in his first report and suggested Dr Kodi’s track record in speculating is not a good one.  Dr Kodi said that at the time he prepared his first report, the reality on the ground had led him and most political analysts to that conclusion. He accepted that opportunities have been opened and seized by President Tshisekedi but said that must be qualified because the majority of the Sacred Union parliamentarians are from the FCC, and still describe themselves as the FCC.  Dr Kodi accepted François Beya, an ally of former President Kabila and appointed by President Tshisekedi as Special Adviser in charge of security and sensitive matters, has now gone. Dr Kodi accepted it is therefore important to focus upon recent sources of background information because even background material from 2019 and 2020 is now “old news”.  </p>

              <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Kodi accepted that the evidence of violations against political opponents is limited.  He was referred to the respondent’s ‘Response to an information request, Democratic Republic of Congo: Political update: November 2021 to April 2022’.  At section 4.2<span style="color:#0070C0"> </span>there is some evidence that Government authorities and the state security forces prevented opposition parties from holding public meetings, assemblies, and peaceful protests. Dr Kodi accepted that in a country of 105 million people, there are very few examples of human rights violations against political opponents.  He said however that the reality is that those in the west of the DRC do not report the violations because they do not know where to go, and they see no action taken against culprits.  </p>

              <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Hansen suggested to Dr Kodi that the evidence of a crackdown against political opponents is such that it is almost non-existent. Dr Kodi disagreed and pointed to his addendum report<span style="color:#0070C0"> </span>in which he states that increasing numbers of journalists and political activists are being harassed, beaten, arrested and detained for expressing dissenting views.  Mr Hansen pointed out that the focus in the addendum report is attacks upon journalists, and that apart from the data recording 116 cases of attacks against journalists, 75 cases of violation of press freedom, including 19 arrests of journalists and closure of 11 media outlets, there are no specific details of attacks on others, including political opponents.  Dr Kodi responded that the problem with statistics in the DRC is that there are no centralised systems for recording such information.  There are a number of secret detention centres that even consulate staff cannot access, so it is difficult to provide statistics.  He accepted however that organisations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch would have a keen interest in those that are harassed, beaten, arrested and detained for expressing dissenting views, but he did not know whether they have any statistics.  </p>

              <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Hansen referred Dr Kodi to the analysis of the human rights situation in 2021 prepared by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office in the DRC (“UNJHRO”).  <span style="color:#000000">Mr Hanson suggested t</span>he analysis records a decrease of nearly 12% in human rights violations compared to 2020, and a reversal of the trend of the previous year, which recorded an increase of 21%.  This decrease reflects a reduction in the number of cases documented in the provinces affected by conflict, particularly Maniema, South Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika and North Kivu, where the UNJHRO recorded less violations committed by State agents and abuses committed by combatants of armed groups, including conflict-related sexual violence, than the previous year.  Dr Kodi said that he agrees with that analysis.  </p>

It is said, at [4.3.6] and [4.3.7], that in total there were 1,860 events <span style="font-style:italic">(that is, protests (including peaceful protests, those where there is state intervention, and where excessive use of force was deployed against protestors) and riots, (mob violence and violent demonstrations)</span> - of all types of actors for the whole country over the period 1 January 2020 to 22 April 2022.  Dr Kodi agreed that demonstrates a downward trend, and he has no other independent statistics to undermine what is said.  He accepted that generally, there are more human rights violations in the east because of the on-going conflict in that area, although he is unable to point to any figures or statistics.  He was prepared to accept that the vast preponderance (over 90%) of the violations take place in the east of the country.  He accepted that he has not dealt with any of those positive developments in the DRC in his written reports.  He maintained the situation in the DRC is not good, and even if there is a downward trend, large numbers of people continue to be killed.</p>

              <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Kodi accepted that President Tshisekedi has now decisively broken ranks with the former president following the formation of the ‘Sacred Union’.   He accepted the net effect of the developments in the DRC since the end of the coalition, is that the influence of former President Kabila has diminished.  It was suggested by Mr Hansen that at the moment, there is no credible sign of a political comeback by former President Kabila.  Dr Kodi referred to the steps taken by President Tshisekedi to disqualify Moise Katumbi from running in the presidential election. He claims Moise Katumbi has recently reconciled with former President Joseph Kabila and most of the political leaders of the former Katanga Province.  Dr Kodi said this may be a sign of former President Kabila coming back to the political scene, not to run as President, but to maintain some influence.  </p>

Time and again, the views set out are responded to by people who are close to the new regime in the DRC.  These people are members of the President’s party, the UDPS.

Dr Kodi acknowledged the responses recorded from various countries, but maintained his opinion as expressed in his reports, that all failed asylum seekers are at risk upon return to the DRC.  He said that none of the countries that responded have a presence at the airport in the DRC and they therefore have no way of knowing how failed asylum seekers are treated on return.

Mr Hansen asked whether Dr Kodi was able to provide any other examples of people abroad having come to the adverse attention of the authorities and targeted since President Tshisekedi was elected.  Dr Kodi said that news on a YouTube channel announced that two residents of the UK that travelled back to the DRC were arrested in December 2021 on arrival.  Their families had informed the media and appealed to various people to intervene.  Dr Kodi said they were held incommunicado for 7 days.  Asked whether he had evidence of other incidents, Dr Kodi said that he had not covered the entire period following President Tshisekedi coming to power, and they were the only three incidents for which he has any concrete evidence.</p>

              <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Kodi said that the ‘monitoring’ of individuals is, he imagines, undertaken by several people.  He said that the Embassy may have some capacity to undertake monitoring and that supporters of the current regime are very active on-line and react to any opposition views expressed.  His evidence was that there are many YouTube channels that are critical of the regime and they regularly complain of attacks when they air criticism.  He said that the DGM has a permanent presence at the Embassy and information is likely to be fed back to the authorities.  Dr Kodi was unable to explain who it is that undertakes the monitoring, or how the targets for any monitoring are identified or chosen.  He said that it would not surprise him if there was monitoring of the diaspora from the DRC.  When pressed about his expertise to support his claim in his report that someone with a basic computer or even a smart phone and basic knowledge of the internet can carry out monitoring, Dr Kodi explained that when he refers to ‘monitoring’ , he is referring to an individual being able to watch an open forum like YouTube.  He does not suggest that it is anything more sinister such as hacking of social media accounts or email.  </p>

He accepted that is difficult to reconcile with the figure of 20,000 referred to in the respondent’s CPIN.  He accepted however that there are five to ten members of staff at the DRC Embassy in London.  When it was suggested by Mr Hansen that the staff would be unable to complete any large-scale monitoring of the diaspora in the UK, Dr Kodi said that there are only a handful of YouTube channels that are used by the diaspora.  Dr Kodi confirmed that he is not aware of any recent demonstrations outside the Embassy.  Dr Kodi said there have been demonstrations since President Tshisekedi came to power, but Dr Kodi did not have the dates.</p>

            <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">In summary, Mr Bazini submits the impact on political opponents (perceived or otherwise) following the change in Presidency is such that the risk of persecution is at least the same as it was under Kabila, if not greater.  Relying upon the evidence of Dr Kodi, Mr Bazini submits there has been no actual, or durable change for the better in respect of the risk of persecution to actual or perceived political opponents of either Tshisekedi or Kabila:</p>

              <p class="p" style="margin-left:1in">The recent change in Presidency in January 2019, and the subsequent creation of the Sacred Union, has not led to any durable change in the risk of persecution to actual or perceived political opponents of either President Tshisekedi or former President Kabila.  There is inherent instability which makes Kabila’s position more effective and if any change has occurred, there is evidence that there has been an increase in human rights abuses committed against those opposing the government now led by President Tshisekedi.</p>

              <p class="p" style="margin-left:1in">It is accepted that President Tshisekedi’s grip on power has strengthened since his creation of the Sacred Union and his dissolution of the power-sharing agreement with Kabila.  However, this has only increased political tensions and created greater room for conflict.  The manner in which Tshisekedi obtained the support required to wrest control away from Kabila creates an inherent instability that makes President Tshisekedi’s position precarious. It is not unsurprising that promises were made to persuade a large majority of FCC parliamentarians to join the Sacred Union. In any event, former President Kabila continues to hold considerable power in key areas, in particular within the security and military apparatus of the country.  Even those who apparently support President Tshisekedi have long histories as being allies to former President Kabila.  President Tshisekedi also has had to bolster his position by entering into agreements with other politicians who may, in the future, choose to no longer support his tenuous control on power. </p>

As such, the previous CG in relation to the risk to UDPS activists etc remains binding.  There can be no presumption of any lasting stability in respect of the UDPS’ hold on power. A shift towards former President Kabila could result in the UDPS losing their position as a ruling party, resulting in their classification, once again, as an opposition party.  Although UDPS activists are not “opposition activists”, should former President Kabila attempt to wrest control from President Tshisekedi they would be in a particularly vulnerable position. </p>

He submits it is not the act of physically returning which creates the risk, but the act of identifying the returnee as someone of possible interest.  He submits the risk upon return can broadly be separated  into three categories: (i) identification of past/present opposition activity; (ii) presumption of past/present opposition activity; and, (iii) exposure to the risk of extortion or similar. Irrespective of which of the categories an individual falls under, there is a very real risk they will, and at the very least, be interrogated and detained.

            <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">He submits that as a result of the re-documentation process necessary for returns, a FAS is pre-identified by the DRC and thus immediately identifiable upon arrival in Kinshasa.  That process includes a mandatory face-to-face interview before an ETD can be issued.  The interview is conducted in the absence of ‘the Home Office’, and as a result, the DGM can ask any questions they wish of the FAS.  The evidence of Dr Kodi is that he interviewed two immigration officials who had been employed by DGM for 25 and 30 years respectively, and he was told individuals are usually asked the reasons why they left the DRC and this is an opportunity to establish the genuineness of the person’s Congolese nationality and to collect related information about their asylum application and the reasons for the claim failing.  Mr Bazini relies upon the evidence of Dr Kodi that the Immigration Attaché, as an agent of DGM, would be remiss if they did not ask about the political activity of the interviewee as the UK harbours some of most radical opposition parties to President Tshisekedi and former President Joseph Kabila’.  It is now well established that an individual cannot be expected to lie during that interview in order to avoid persecution or serious harm.  Furthermore, an individual incurs greater risk of harm should they lie and then be exposed as having lied.  The mere act of lying may result in the authorities assuming the individual has been undertaking activities against the regime and is attempting to hide it. Mr Bazini submits that in addition, there is an additional risk posed as a result of the rampant corruption found within DRC. </p>

            <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before we address the issues, we make some general observations about the evidence of Dr Kodi that we have read and heard.  We have set out Dr Kodi’s evidence in detail because in many respects it represents the high water mark in the appellant’s case.  The parties invited us to approach this evidence in a starkly different manner. Overall, whilst the respondent accepts Dr Kodi’s general expertise in relation to the DRC, she does not accept his opinions and conclusions on a number of the central issues in the case. Mr Hansen submitted the evidence of Dr Kodi is not reliable, based as it is on assertion, anonymous sources (or anonymised evidence about ill-treatment on arrival), out-of-date material (as old as 2012) and unreliable evidence.  By contrast Mr Bazini submitted that Dr Kodi had given his evidence in a genuine and straightforward manner and his opinions should be given significant weight.</p>

            <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">We will return to the evidence of Dr Kodi as far as it is necessary to do so in considering the issues before us.  We have no doubt that Dr Kodi was doing his best to assist the Tribunal.  However, we note from the outset that having had the opportunity of hearing the evidence of Dr Kodi, and of observing his opinions comprehensively tested in cross examination, we agree with the submission made by Mr Hansen that Dr Kodi was prone to speculate and make (invariably) adverse assumptions, and that his general approach substantially undermines his evidence and the weight we attach to his opinions.  Much of the evidence set out in his written reports predates the formation of the Sacred Union.  He relies on anonymous or unreliable sources and his opinions are not grounded in concrete, credible or current examples. We did not find Dr Kodi to be objective in his evidence and although he made some concessions when he was bound to, he did not appear to be prepared to attach due weight to credible background material that pointed in the other direction to the unsubstantiated and vague claims made by sources that he consulted.    We therefore prefer the submissions made by Mr Hansen regarding the correct approach to Mr Kodi’s evidence.</p>

Dr Kodi states President Tshisekedi was seeking to replace the coalition with a new parliamentary majority in the National Assembly that would be favourable to him, and allow him to implement his vision for the DRC. President Tshisekedi and his allies had been trying to attract – allegedly using bribes - FCC parliamentarians to form this new majority called Sacred Union, which would allow him to appoint a new and more amenable Prime Minister and a new government. Dr Kodi was however sceptical whether President Tshisekedi would succeed given the dominance of the FCC in the National Assembly.  He was of the view that even if he did succeed, President Tshisekedi’s new allies would expect financial rewards and prominent positions in the government.  He doubted whether President Tshisekedi would be able to implement his vision with the Sacred Union.  He said that he and other analysists believe that Kabila’s camp will not go down without fighting.</p>

He accepted allies of former President Kabila such as François Beya, have now left.  The evidence before us clearly demonstrates that the Sacred Union formed in early 2021 is now the majority governing coalition composed of 24 political groups, including President Tshisekedi’s UDPS. </p>

In our view Dr Kodi’s evidence that there are signs of former President Kabila coming back to the political scene, not to run as President, but to maintain some influence is based upon nothing more than speculation.  In his oral evidence, as we have set out at paragraph [67] above, Dr Kodi referred to an article published in ‘Africa Continental’ on 4 March 2022 that states <span style="font-style:italic">“…Tshisekedi has been treading cautiously in his dealings with ex-President Joseph Kabila, whose profile has diminished over the past year…”.  </span>The article does not support Dr Kodi’s view that there are signs of former President Kabila coming back to the political scene.  In fact, the paragraph referred to by Dr Kodi goes on to say, “<span style="font-style:italic">..Rarely attending meetings of the Senate in Kinshasa, Kabila has shown little interest in a political comeback..</span> “.  In the end, Dr Kodi accepted in his evidence before us that there is evidence that former President Kabila’s profile has diminished, that he has been marginalised and appears to have shown  little interest in a political comeback.  </p>

We accept, as does the respondent, that the background material demonstrates that President Tshisekedi has not delivered on all his promises.  As the Head of the Catholic Church, Cardinal Fridolin Ambongo, the Archbishop of Kinshasa said in his statement on 29 May 2022, the DRC is not paradise.  That must however be viewed in light of events between the Presidential Elections held on 30 December 2018 and a gradual decline in the power and influence of the former President Kabila since then.  Our focus is upon the present position in the DRC.  </p>

            <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">In his addendum report, Dr Kodi refers to the resurgence in North Kivu of the M23 rebel group that was defeated in 2012 by the Congolese army with the assistance of the UN forces.  Dr Kodi claims this new development has the potential to dent President Tshisekedi’s popularity even further, since protesters have accused him of mishandling the crisis and of having given Rwanda a big share of the minerals of the Maniema, and North and South Kivu. Dr Kodi claims it is likely that if this crisis persists, opposition parties would become even more critical of the regime, which could again provoke a brutal repression of the critics of the regime. Opposition party activists would likely be targeted by the security forces.  That in our judgement is again nothing more than speculation.  As Mr Hansen was able to effectively demonstrate Dr Kodi’s track record in speculating about the future of the DRC is not a good one, as the passage of time has demonstrated. </p>

            <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">Dr Kodi maintained the situation in the DRC remains volatile and in the way things changed between March and July 2021, things can change again.  Whilst that is always a possibility, we did not find Dr Kodi to be entirely objective or focussed when addressing the evidence in this respect.  A useful summary of the main trends in human rights violations and abuses in the DRC is set out in the analysis of the human rights situation in 2021 prepared by the United Nations Joint Human Rights Office in the DRC (“UNJHRO”).  The analysis states:</p>

This is a decrease of nearly 12% compared to 2020 and a reversal of the trend of the previous year, which recorded an increase of 21%. This decrease reflects a reduction in the number of cases documented in the provinces affected by conflict, particularly Maniema, South Kivu, Ituri, Tanganyika and North Kivu, where the UNJHRO recorded less violations committed by State agents and abuses committed by combatants of armed groups, including conflict-related sexual violence, than the previous year. The military operations against armed groups carried out by the Forces armées de la République démocratique du Congo (FARDC) with support from MONUSCO in accordance with the Human Rights Due Diligence Policy (HRDDP), which subjects the support provided by the United Nations to the Congolese defense and security forces to certain conditions, in particular respect for international human rights, humanitarian and refugee law as well as the implementation of risk mitigation measures, may help to explain this trend.”.</span></p>

            <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">He agreed with that analysis.  Dr Kodi also accepted the update from ACLED that is set out in the respondent’s CPIN, Democratic Republic of Congo: Political update: November 2021 to April 2022.  It is said, at [4.3.6] and [4.3.7], that in total there were 1,860 events (that is, protests <span style="font-style:italic">(including peaceful protests, those where there is state intervention, and where excessive use of force was deployed against protestors)</span> and riots, <span style="font-style:italic">(mob violence and violent demonstrations)</span>) - of all types of actors for the whole country over the period 1 January 2020 to 22 April 2022.    Dr Kodi agreed that demonstrates a downward trend, and he has no other independent statistics to undermine what is said.  He accepted that generally, there are more human rights violations in the east because of the on-going conflict in that area, although he is unable to point to any figures or statistics.  He was prepared to accept that the vast preponderance (over 90%) of the violations take place in the east of the country.  He accepted that he has not dealt with any of those positive developments in the DRC in his written reports, and failed to provide a plausible cogent explanation for this omission.</p>

We address this evidence in more detail below.  Having considered the wealth of background material before us, and the evidence of Dr Kodi, we are left in no doubt, and find that there has been a durable political change following the change in Presidency in 2019, and in particular following the formation of the Sacred Union in April 2021 marking the end of what began as a power sharing agreement between President Tshisekedi and the former President Kabila.  We find the change in Presidency following the elections held on 30 December 2018 and the announcement on 10 January 2019 that Felix Tshisekedi was the winner of the elections, has led to a durable change in the risk on return.</p>

The report refers to political prisoners and detainees during the year, consisting primarily of individuals arrested under defamation laws for criticising the actions of government officials.  The report refers to the arrest of Jean-Bosco Assamba, the Ituri provincial parliamentarian, who was arrested in June for criticising President Tshisekedi for allegedly making false promises. He was detained in Bunia prison for two days before being released. The report also refers to the President of the youth league of the ‘Together for the Republic Party’, Jacky Ndala, being sentenced to 2 years imprisonment for his rhetoric against a proposed bill that would restrict eligibility for senior officials, including the presidency, based on the nationality of an individual’s parents. It is said that “local press reports reported that Ndala was accused of inciting rebellion and civil disobedience after asking persons in eastern Kinshasa to oppose the bill.”  On appeal, the sentence was reduced to 22 months in prison.  The report also refers<span style="color:#0070C0"> </span>to the arrest in January of Daniel Ngoy Mulunda, the former chairman of the Independent National Electoral Commission, in Lubumbashi for antagonising tribal tensions.

Dr Kodi’s evidence that the CSG has expressed ‘strong views’ about the collusion between former President Kabila and President Tshisekedi is  unsupported by cogent evidence and is in fact undermined by the evidence before us of the organisation’s various social media platforms.  Dr Kodi accepted the CSG is not referred to by any EU Member state as an ‘opposition group’, and that the CGS website and Facebook account is rarely used.  Although Dr Kodi was not prepared to accept that the focus of the group was on the former President Kabila, we find that it is.  Beyond the strapline <span style="font-style:italic">“Tshisekedi must resign because he is working with Kabila, a criminal, he must be arrested with his regime” </span>on one of its websites, there is little evidence before us of a concerted effort to voice any strong opposition to President Tshisekedi.  The videos Dr Kodi refers to, in which he claims the CSG express views against President Tshisekedi, are themselves now dated.  The strapline is also dated and predates more recent political events in the DRC.  Dr Kodi accepted there is no reference whatsoever to the CSG in the report drafted by the Documentation and Research Centre (Cedoca) of the CGRS in Belgium (with its large DRC diaspora).  Dr Kodi accepted the ‘tweets’ from the Twitter account of Okito Tongomo, the leader of the CSG, are generally supportive of President Tshisekedi.</p>

His evidence in this respect is again indicative of his inability to provide independent objective evidence without resorting to conjecture or assumptions.  He cannot possibly know why the CSG has not updated its website.  He suggested that it was always possible that members exchange messages using ‘WhatsApp’.  That may be so, but there is not a shred of evidence before us that members of the CSG articulate opposition to the authorities in the DRC such that they would be viewed adversely for doing so, even if that were possible via WhatsApp.</p>

He claims the Congolese Immigration Officers he interviewed by telephone on 6 March 2021, confirmed this information regarding the Immigration Attaché’s behaviour during the interviews of failed asylum seekers.  </p>

            <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">We reject the claims that the Immigration Attaché, during interview, collects information about any asylum claim, why it has been rejected, or of an individual’s political activities.  We are not concerned with whether it would be remiss for the Immigration Attaché to adopt a certain course, but to identify what, to the lower standard, might happen.  Dr Kodi’s evidence on this is contradictory.  In cross-examination Dr Kodi accepted an ETD is issued after a face-to-face interview and that the authorities do not at that stage, identify the individual as a FAS or the basis of any protection claim.  Having accepted that, he also maintained, based upon information provided by sources he consulted that the reality is that the DGM Attaché interviews individuals and asks about the individual’s activities in the UK and the reason for any protection claim or any prison sentence imposed.  </p>

The fact that an individual might be asked why they are detained or in prison, is not to say that any wider enquiry is made about the individual’s presence in the UK.    True it is, as Dr Kodi claims, that the Home Office staff do not attend redocumentation interviews, but neither do human rights activists, and so we are left with the claims made by the Immigration Officers Dr Kodi interviewed and the background material.</p>

            <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in"> When addressing the interview at the DRC Embassy, Dr Kodi expressed his view that “it would be remiss” if the Immigration Attaché, did not ask about the political activity of the interviewee.  He went on to claim the Immigration Officers he spoke to on 6 March 2021 <span style="font-style:italic">“confirmed this information on the Immigration Attaché’s behaviour during the interviews of failed asylum seekers”</span>.  He did not elaborate upon the information he was provided.  Unsurprisingly, in written questions put to Dr Kodi, the respondent asked Dr Kodi to identify the questions he actually asked the immigration officers and when.  In his response dated 19<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">th</span> July 2021, he set out the questions asked and answers he was given.  In his evidence before us, Dr Kodi said that he had taken notes of the interviews but, consistent with the methodology adopted by many other researchers, he disposed of the notes to ensure the notes could not fall into the wrong hands. The evidence of Dr Kodi is that the information was gathered for the purposes of other expert reports he was preparing at the time.  We have not been provided with copies of those reports that may have cast further light upon what Dr Kodi was told nearer the time.   In the absence of any contemporaneous notes of the interviews we do not accept that what is recorded by Dr Kodi is in fact an accurate reflection of the information he was provided.  We do not accept that Dr Kodi would have been able to recollect with such precision, the questions that he asked and the responses that he received, some months after the conversations took place.  We find that although he is doing his best to assist the Tribunal, his recollection is clouded by his lack of objectivity and his own views as to what he considers the Immigration Attaché was likely to ask about. </p>

Neither do we accept his claim that all failed asylum seekers are at risk because the DRC authorities suspect them of having betrayed their country of origin by telling lies about human rights and the political situation of the country.  To support his claims Dr Kodi relies principally upon four sources: first, the report Unsafe Returns III compiled by Catherine Ramos; second, the blog on the website of the Faculty of Law of the University of Oxford in November 2016 by Dr. Jill Alpes; third the email from the President of the Bill Clinton Foundation for Peace, Emmanuel Cole, sent to the research centre of the Belgian Commissioner General for Refugees and Stateless persons dated 4th August 2019;  fourth, the telephone interviews that he conducted with two immigration officials and three human rights activists.</p>

            <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">The reliance by Dr Kodi upon the reports of Catherine Ramos and Dr Jill Alpes is in our view entirely misplaced.  The report Unsafe Returns III refers to the period 2015 to 2019 and considered the position of 18/19 returnees monitored during that period. The last returnee that was referred to as ‘case Study 18’ in the report, was a female failed asylum seeker who had been removed on her own passport on 26 May 2018, before President Tshisekedi was elected.  The Blog by Dr Jill Alpes now dates back as far as November 2016, again, before President Tshisekedi was elected.  That alone diminishes the weight that can properly be attached to that material when this Tribunal is concerned with the risk upon return after President Tshisekedi was elected.  </p>

            <p class="p" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to what happens on arrival in the DRC, Dr Kodi claims that the Immigration Officials and human rights activists he interviewed while doing research for his reports, reported that they had witnessed or were informed about cases of returnees. Each one of them separately advised that they knew of between 2 and 18 cases of such arrests since January 2019.  They declined to share the names of the returnees for fear of reprisals for themselves and the returnees.  We attach very little weight to Dr Kodi’s bold claim that the view was that all people, whether leaders or rank-and-file members are treated the same, without any information regarding specific events or an individual’s activities.  Whilst we understand that his sources may have declined to share the names of any specific individuals, the evidence of Dr Kodi is lacking in material respects.  We have no evidence at all of any of the “2 to 18” cases of arrests since January 2019, the background of the individuals, the events leading to the arrests, or indeed any information as to how those individuals were treated.  The evidence of Dr Kodi is also undermined by his failure to return to any of his sources in order to attempt to establish a more up-to-date picture of how events are unfolding in the DRC following the change in regime.  Dr Kodi said in cross-examination that he has no information that indicates there have been any changes since then.  That is to miss the point.  It must be obvious to Dr Kodi that the situation in the DRC has remained fluid with major changes in the political landscape and the treatment of opponents.  </p>

The background material that we refer to above establishes there is no “consistent pattern” of evidence of mistreatment of returnees and as regards the current situation, Dr Kodi is very much a lone voice.  The weight of the more recent evidence is flatly against Dr Kodi’s opinion that all failed asylum seekers are at risk upon return to the DRC.  That is so, whether it is based upon the identification of past/present opposition activity, or a presumption of past/present opposition activity.  The background material we have referred to also establishes that a FAS is not at exposure due to the risk of extortion or bribery.</span></p>

We accept however, as Mr Hansen submits, there is no credible evidence that the current authorities in the DRC are interested in monitoring the diaspora community in the UK; nor is there is any credible evidence that the intelligence capability exists, even if there were the appetite.  Having considered the wealth of background material before us, we find the entirety of Dr Kodi’s evidence on this topic is based on nothing more than speculation.

In his first report, Dr Kodi noted that the essential documentation that a person needs to obtain housing, employment, and to travel internally in the country is the voter’s card, which serves as the national identity card; it is usually issued before a general election.  In his evidence before us, Dr Kodi accepted that a national of the DRC would, in principle, qualify for a ‘voter card’.  His evidence is that it can be difficult to get one.  Ideally, one would have their voter card from the last election (2018).  Without that, there are a number of documents that an individual would have to provide and that would have to be accompanied by the testimony of three individuals.  Dr Kodi confirmed that he accepts what is said in the respondent’s ‘Response to an information request, Democratic Republic Congo: Documentation – voter card, 19 May 2022’<span style="color:#0070C0"> </span>which sets out the procedure for obtaining a voter card, and the process for obtaining a replacement card if the original was lost or stolen.

The Supreme Court confirmed that that is a demanding threshold for an applicant. His or her evidence must be capable of demonstrating “substantial” grounds for believing that it is a “very exceptional case” because of a “real” risk of subjection to “inhuman” treatment. We find that the evidence before us does not even begin to demonstrate that a FAS will face treatment contrary to Article 3 generally, as a result of being unable to obtain the necessary ID to access basic services.  It is clear that a DRC national who meets the relevant requirements is able to obtain a ‘voter card’ in the DRC using a range of documents as a means of identification and to prove their age.  A replacement is available if the original is lost or stolen. </p>
