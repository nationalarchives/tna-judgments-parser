            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">It is not in issue that, at the time M removed TKJ from Italy: TKJ was habitually resident in Italy (Williams J having summarily dismissed an argument to the contrary by order of 21 September 2023); the father was exercising rights of custody within the meaning of the 1980 Hague Convention; the father had not consented or acquiesced in the removal, which was in breach of his rights of custody which were being exercised; TKJ is too young for any objections to return she may have to be considered for the purposes of any exception under Article 13 of the Hague Convention; and the application was made within 12 months of the removal so there is no settlement exception available under Article 12.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">In those circumstances, the Court is bound to order TKJ’s return to Italy unless M succeeds in establishing the exception under Article 13(b), namely that if I ordered TKJ’s return there is a grave risk that would expose her to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place her in an intolerable situation.  If that exception is established, M submits the court is not bound to order EF’s summary return and should not do so in its discretion.  M also maintains that to return TKJ to Italy would have the effect of returning M to a situation in which she will be at a real risk of suffering harm amounting to torture or inhuman and degrading treatment, contrary to Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights (‘ECHR’), and an order for return is therefore prohibited by s 6 Human Rights Act 1998 (‘HRA’).  Those are the substantive issues I must decide.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">I remind myself that I am not concerned with the issue ‘what is best for the child?’ but ‘who should decide what is best for the child?’.  That decision should be taken by the courts in the state of habitual residence (Italy) unless M is able to establish the exception under Article 13(b) and I do not order return in my discretion: <span style="font-style:italic">DT v LBT (Abduction: Domestic Abuse) </span>[2011] 1 FLR 1215, [23(2)], per Jackson (then) J.  Whatever my decision, the courts of either Italy or England and Wales will in due course have to decide the child welfare issues including residence and contact.  My decision will determine where TKJ and, by extension, M will live while those issues are determined.</p>

While living in Italy, F had opened a restaurant which had failed, leaving F bankrupt.  He stopped working and began drinking heavily.  While drunk he became very aggressive and violent towards M, making threats to kill her and causing criminal damage in the home by throwing or kicking their possessions.  M was constantly in fear for her own and TKJ’s safety, particularly when F drove a car with TKJ as a passenger while under the influence of alcohol.  M had no support networks in Italy and feared what would happen if she went to the police.  F would often threaten that if M left him, he would take TKJ to Egypt and raise her there, with the help of his mother.</p>

F hit M so hard in the face using the back of his hand that M bled from her mouth and nose.  They were in the living room and TKJ witnessed the assault.  There was blood all over the floor.  F recorded the aftermath of the incident on her mobile phone.  The following day, TKJ was playing on M’s mobile phone and accidentally sent the video to a friend of M’s on Instagram.

F lost his temper and grabbed a kitchen knife from the kitchen, held it to M’s chest and threatened to kill her.  M was petrified, apologised and asked him to put the knife down.  F then punched her in the face and pushed her onto the balcony. TKJ witnessed the assault.  M briefly contemplated escaping by climbing down from the balcony (the flat was on the 2<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">nd</span> floor) but was concerned about leaving TKJ alone with F.

Attached to the application in form C1A were F’s allegations of harm and domestic violence including ‘physical, emotional, psychological, sexual and financial’ harm, which stated that F ‘has threatened her with a knife’ ‘he has threatened to hurt her family’ and ‘he has hit her in the ribcage’.  M gives as an example the assault in which F threw a heavy perfume bottle at her (above, paragraph 10.2). M also alleges that F ‘drove drunk with his daughter in the car, endangering the child’.   The prohibited steps and non-molestation orders were made by Recorder Hellens on 23 December 2022.  The non-molestation order makes clear on its face that breach of its terms is a criminal offence.  Included among its terms was the following prohibition:</p>

However, it is clear that he had received notice of these proceedings by 15 February 2023, at the latest, because on that day F made a supplementary complaint to the police in Italy in which the proceedings in Milton Keynes are referred to.

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">On 21 February 2023 F left more threatening and abusive messages.  There was then a gap before a further abusive message was left on MSO’s phone on 27 April 2023.  Again, a selection of these is detailed in Appendix 1.  The messages then appear to stop until August 2023.  When I asked Dr. Proudman whether this was because M, MBL and MSO had blocked F from being able to send messages, she requested permission for M to admit a further statement addressing this point, which was filed on 31 January 2023.  In that statement M explains that she changed her WhatsApp number so F could no longer contact her directly in April 2023.  F tried to contact her on Facebook and Instagram between March and August 2023, but M no longer has access to those messages as her old phone broke and she does not have the log in details for the accounts, so she made new accounts.  MBL blocked F from being able to contact him on his phone in April 2023.  MSO contacted F to inform him of the court hearing on 9 May 2023, in one of his messages in response F stated that he ‘does not have time for this bullshit’, but otherwise she had no further contact with him.  </p>

The recitals to the order record that Knowles J made clear to F that such contact was not to be used as a vehicle to contact the mother.  The mother alleged (although very late in the day) that in a number of these calls F was abusive.  She recalls one occasion in September 2023 when he called M a ‘whore’ and appeared to be drunk and slurring his words.  On 25 October 2023 M received an audio message from F in Arabic, which was played in court.  M maintained that this message contained a highly offensive Arabic phrase. F denied that the message was offensive.   I gave M permission to obtain a translation of this message which was exhibited to her statement filed on 31 January 2024.  The transcription reads:</p>

He also denies he has any problem with alcohol or that he is bankrupt.  He points out that there is no independent evidence of any of the injuries M alleges that she suffered or any evidence from social services, police or criminal justice authorities to substantiate her claims.  That, he says, is because they are ‘made up’.  So far as threatening to take TKJ to Egypt to raise her with the help of his mother, he says his mother in fact lives with him in Italy.  F has also offered a number of undertakings by way of protective measures, which I consider at paragraph 56, below.</p>

Dr. Cleo Van Velsen, a consultant psychiatrist, produced two reports dated 5 and 25 January 2024 and gave oral evidence, answering questions from both Dr. Proudman and Ms. Kumar.  She was asked for her opinion as to: whether M was suffering from any mental disorder; what treatment might alleviate that condition; what impact a return to Italy would have on her mental health and her ability to parent TKJ; and what protective measures could be put in place to mitigate any adverse impact on her mental health.</p>

In 2023 M attended her GP in the UK reporting low mood and anxiety at the prospect of a return to Italy and was prescribed Propranalol medication to treat anxiety.  Dr. Van Velsen did not have access to M’s Italian medical records, but she did review her UK GP records.  These record a visit on 26 September 2023 in which M reported ‘anxiety and stress as a result of domestic abuse’ that ‘these symptoms date from January 2023 … still having this problem and is getting worse … [M is] worried about the court hearing and that I will probably have to return to Italy with my daughter’.  She was seen the following day and was said to report she was ‘not sleeping well and anxious’.</p>

She reported insomnia, waking early, bad dreams (for example when she needs to go to court) and the dreams sometimes involve her ex-partner.  She denied any active suicidal thoughts although ‘I sometimes feel that I might lose control’.  In the past she had suicidal thoughts but not now.  She has no history of deliberate self-harm or suicide attempts but repeated ‘I feel fearful for my life’.  In her addendum report Dr. Van Velsen repeated that M ‘did not describe suicidal thoughts at the time of the interview’ and ‘there is no history of suicidal plans or actions, and I cannot predict that these will develop.  They might’.  Under questioning from Dr. Proudman the doctor denied that she had misunderstood M and stood by her assessment that there was no active suicidal ideation, but could not rule that out if she returned to Italy.  There was no family history of mental disorder.</p>

          <intro>
            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Dr. Van Velsen’s provisional diagnosis was that M is suffering from an ‘adjustment disorder’ in response to the stressor of F’s domestic abuse.  However, that diagnosis was conditional on the court finding the allegations of domestic abuse to be true: the doctor had, quite properly, made no such findings or assumptions herself.  When I asked her to assume those allegations to be true, she was very clear of the diagnosis of an adjustment disorder, with mixed anxiety and depressed mood (DSM-V, 309.28).  She was adamant, however, that the symptoms were not so severe as to warrant a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), even under Dr. Proudman’s searching questions on this issue.  M’s presentation lacked the necessary features for a PTSD diagnosis of recurrent, involuntary and intrusive memories, flashbacks and nightmares.  However, she opined, if the causative stressor of her condition, the domestic abuse, was to continue then M’s condition will become worse and might develop into a depressive order, more severe anxiety, or PTSD.  It is relatively common for an adjustment disorder to develop into PTSD.  In those circumstances M might become actively suicidal.  Measures could be put in place that would reduce the impact of a return to Italy such as a non-molestation order or a referral to psychiatrist in Italy.  If she lacked that help and support, it could trigger more severe feelings of anxiety and perhaps depression.  In particular, if F did not respect the boundaries placed upon him and continued to pester or harass her that would make her adjustment disorder worse and she would not be safe.   She accepted that M’s symptoms ‘could get a lot worse on her return’ in those circumstances.  This would be exacerbated if she felt helpless, stuck, unable to escape, and isolated from the support of her family that she enjoys in the United Kingdom.  Dr. Van Velsen had not seen the abusive messages from F and therefore did not discuss these with the mother, but agreed that if similar messages were sent in future they would have a negative impact on M’s mental health, notwithstanding her evident resilience.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The underlying purpose of the 1980 Hague Convention, which is given effect domestically by the Child Abduction and Custody Act 1985, is to enable the ‘prompt return of children wrongfully removed to or retained in any Contracting state’ (Article 1).  It is intended to provide a swift, summary procedure for a left-behind parent to secure the return of a child wrongfully removed to or retained in another country by the removing parent.  Where the procedure is triggered the courts of the requested state are required to ‘act expeditiously’ (Article 11), if possible, within six weeks of the request being made.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1"><p class="FootnoteText" style="margin-left:0.3in"> Under the terms of EU Council Regulation 2201/2003 (the ‘Brussels IIa Convention’) the process was expected to be completed within six weeks of the application being made.  Although, since the UK’s departure from the EU on 31 January 2020, Brussels IIa no longer applies so there is no longer a legal deadline, Hague Convention proceedings are still expected to be completed within a six week window: para 1.2 of the Practice Guidance ‘Case Management and Mediation of International Child Abduction Proceedings’ (2018) (the Practice Guidance).</p></authorialNote>  Once a request is made, the courts of the requested state ‘shall not decide on the merits of rights of custody until a determination has been made that the child is not to be returned’ (Article 16).  </p>

Where these criteria are satisfied, there is a prima facie duty to return the child if less than a year has elapsed since the wrongful removal or retention or more than a year has passed and it is not demonstrated that the child has now settled in their new environment (Article 12).</p>

It is also based on a second assumption, namely that ‘the best interests of the child will be served by a prompt return to the country where he is habitually resident’.  This latter assumption may, however, be rebutted, ‘albeit in a limited range of circumstances, but all of them inspired by the best interests of the child’, namely if one of the exceptions in Articles 12, 13 or 20 are made out:</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">The parent opposing return may establish an exception under Article 13(b) if they prove that ‘there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation’.  The Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">E </span>held at [31-34] that Article 13(b), by its very terms, is of restricted application.  In addition to the burden being on the parent opposing return there are the following limitations on its application:</p>

              <p class="Listpara2" style="margin-left:0.89in;text-indent:0.01in">The risk of harm to the child must be ‘grave’.  It is not enough that the risk be ‘real’.  The risk must reach a certain level of seriousness as to be characterized as ‘grave’.  Although ‘grave’ characterizes the risk rather than the harm, there is in ordinary language a link between the two.  Thus, a relatively low risk of death or really serious injury might properly be qualified as ‘grave’ while a higher level of risk might be required for other less serious forms of harm: <span style="font-style:italic">Re.

It is a ‘strong word’, but when applied to a child must mean ‘a situation which this particular child in these particular circumstances should not be expected to tolerate’.  Every child must put up with a certain level of ‘rough and tumble, discomfort and distress’, but there are ‘some things it is not reasonable for a child to tolerate’.  Among these are physical or psychological abuse or neglect of the child, as well as ‘exposure to the harmful effects of seeing and hearing the physical or psychological abuse of her own parent’, including where ‘the mother’s subjective perception of events lead to a mental illness which could have intolerable consequences for the child’: <span style="font-style:italic">Re.

There may, objectively, be a ‘grave risk’ that the child would be exposed to physical or psychological harm or otherwise placed in an intolerable situation if they are returned (whether with or without the removing parent) to live with the left-behind parent without any protective measures.  But if, for example, the child can be returned to a different setting, with effective restrictions on the left-behind parent having any contact with them and the removing parent, then the threshold required for Article 13(b) purposes will not be crossed.  The gravity of the risk of harm, including both its likelihood and the potential seriousness of the harm, needs to be evaluated in the light of the availability and efficacy of any protective measures.  ‘The clearer the need for protection, the more effective the protective measures must be’: <span style="font-style:italic">Re.

However, given the nature of allegations of domestic abuse upon which the risk of harm is likely to be founded and the limited evidence available given the summary nature of the proceedings, the court may be unable to determine the truth of the allegations.  The courts have therefore adopted a pragmatic solution.  Unless the available evidence enables them ‘confidently to discount the possibility that the allegations give rise to an article 13(b) risk’, the judge ‘should assume the risk of harm at its highest and then, if that risk meets the threshold in Article 13(b), go on to consider whether protective measures sufficient to mitigate the harm can be identified’: <span style="font-style:italic">Uhd v Mckay</span> [2019] 2 FLR 1159, per MacDonald J, [68-70], applying <span style="font-style:italic">Re.

The court cannot infer that allegations are not true simply because a victim has not reported allegations of domestic abuse or because she has remained in an allegedly abusive relationship.  She referred to observations to that effect by Judd J in <span style="font-style:italic">M (A Child)</span> [2021] EWHC 3225 (Fam), [81-82], by Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic">Re B-B (Domestic Abuse: Fact-Finding</span>) [2022] EWHC 108 (Fam), [98] and by Knowles J in <span style="font-style:italic">A v B </span>[2022] EWHC 3089 (Fam), [63-64].  A victim of abuse may remain in a relationship because they have ‘lost any objective sense of what is acceptable and unacceptable in a relationship’ (per Cobb J in <span style="font-style:italic">B-B</span>, [98]) or because their ability to resist their abuser has been compromised.  As Hayden J noted in <span style="font-style:italic">F v M</span>, [83, 113], there may be no need for an abuser to lock a victim of abuse in their home; eventually, the victim may effectively ‘lock themselves in’.  And a victim of abuse may not report abuse for the same reasons or because of ‘shame, fear of being disbelieved or fear that the process of reporting an assault will itself be traumatic’: per Knowles J in <span style="font-style:italic">A v B</span>, [64].</p>

However, the court retains a discretion to return the child.  This discretion is ‘at large’, that is to say it is not exercised within limits set down by the Hague Convention: per Baroness Hale in <span style="font-style:italic">Re. M (Abduction: Zimbabwe)</span> [2008] 1 FLR 251, giving a speech with which the rest of the House of Lords agreed: [43].  The underlying purposes of the Hague Convention are relevant to the exercise of the discretion, but should not always be given more weight than other considerations, which may include wider considerations of the child’s rights and welfare: [43].  The exercise of discretion will be determined by the court’s findings as to why there is no obligation to return the child.  For example, where the decision has been taken under Article 13(b) that there is a ‘grave risk’ of harm to the child if they are returned it will be ‘inconceivable’ that the court will nevertheless in its discretion order their return: [45] (a point she had also made in <span style="font-style:italic">Re.

A return under the Hague Convention may also have implications under Articles 2 (the right to life) and 3 (the right not to be subjected to torture or inhuman and degrading treatment) ECHR.  States are prohibited from removing or returning an individual to another state where there are substantial grounds for believing they would be at a real risk of a breach of Article 2 or 3 if returned: <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">Soering v United Kingdom </span><span style="color:#000000">(1989) 11 EHRR 439, </span><span style="font-style:italic">Re.

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">M submits that, where the court is considering an application under the Hague Convention to return a child removed by a victim of domestic abuse, an investigation into the Article 2 and 3 implications of ordering return is called for.  If the court were to find that there were substantial grounds for believing that an order for return would expose the victim to a real risk of inhuman and degrading treatment – or worse – as a result of domestic abuse by the left-behind parent, this would have implications under Articles 2 and 3 unless (a) the child could safely be returned on her own, or (b) there are sufficient protective measures in the receiving state to avoid the risk of harm.  A return would otherwise be prohibited by s 6 Human Rights Act 1998 and Article 20 of the Hague Convention, which is set out in material part at paragraph 30.5, above.  M submits, following this logic, that I must assess the Article 3 compatibility of the proposed return and refuse it because there is a real risk that M will suffer torture or inhuman and degrading treatment at the hands of F if TKJ is returned as M will have no option but to accompany her.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">Neither I nor Counsel could find any authority where this issue has been directly addressed by the courts.  However, Ms. Kumar drew to my attention to <span style="font-style:italic;color:#000000">G v G </span><span style="color:#000000">[2022] AC 544 </span>in which the issue was addressed indirectly by the Supreme Court<span style="color:#000000">.  In that case the courts had to resolve competing claims for asylum by removing a mother and child and for the child’s return under the Hague Convention by the left-behind father.  The claim for asylum was based on the mother’s fear of persecution from her family in South Africa on the grounds of her sexuality.  She resisted the Hague Convention application under Article 13(b) (citing the father’s domestic abuse) and 13(2) (child’s objections).  The mother claimed that the Hague Convention application could not be determined, or any order implemented until the asylum application had been resolved, which might take years.  The High Court (Lieven J) stayed the Hague Convention application and the father appealed.  The Court of Appeal allowed the father’s appeal and lifted the stay.  The mother appealed to the Supreme Court, where her appeal was partially successful.  Of relevance to this case, one of the grounds of appeal was that the making of an asylum application to the Home Secretary operated as a bar to the High Court determining a Hague Convention case.  That was because the asylum application involved an assessment of whether there was a real risk of a breach of the mother’s human rights on return.  If there was such a risk, return would be prevented by the Hague Convention by Article 20.  That Article 20 issue could not be determined while the asylum claim was outstanding because any question of asylum protection was exclusively for the Home Secretary.  The relevant part of the Supreme Court’s judgment is at [155] where Lord Stephens, giving the judgment with which Lords Lloyd-Jones, Hamble, Leggatt and Burrows JJSC agreed, ruled out the use of Article 20 in this way because the issues raised are to be determined under Article 13(b) (emphasis added):</span></p>

                    <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1in">155 The ground of appeal was in essence based on article 20 of the 1980 Hague Convention … Although this article is not expressly incorporated by the 1985 Act, it has been given domestic effect by section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 which makes it unlawful for any public authority to act in a way that is incompatible with the ECHR, so that a court (as a public authority) is bound to give effect to ECHR rights wherever they appear, including the rights in article 20 (<span style="font-style:italic">In re D</span> [2007] 1 AC 619, para 65). <span style="font-style:italic">If a taking parent has been subjected to, for instance, abuse by the left-behind parent … then the issues which could be raised under article 20 are, as the Court of Appeal stated at para 41, amply reflected in the operation of article 13(b)</span>. I need only refer to what Lord Wilson JSC said at para 34 of <span style="font-style:italic">In re S</span> [2012] 2 AC 257: “The critical question is what will happen if, with the mother, the child is returned. If the court concludes that, on return, the mother will suffer such anxieties that their effect on her mental health will create a situation that is intolerable for the child, then the child should not be returned.” <span style="font-style:italic">The application of article 13(b) ensures that the court is not acting in a way which is incompatible with the ECHR. The 1980 Hague Convention proceedings are focused upon the child, but that focus itself involves consideration of the position of the taking parent. Article 20 is not to be used as a way around the rigours of the other exceptions to return of the child</span>.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.39in">In the light of that dictum Dr Proudman conceded, in my view rightly, that an argument that a return order will expose a victim of domestic abuse to a risk of a breach of Article 2 or 3 is to be determined indirectly through the operation of Article 13(b) and not directly through Article 20.  Both parties accepted that the distinctions between the two are likely to be more theoretical than real.  Both approaches require an assessment of the risk to the victim of domestic abuse on return and whether the available protective measures are adequate to address that risk.  The only dispute between the parties was whether I should conduct a separate Article 3 analysis as part of the Article 13(b) exercise: Dr. Proudman submitted that I should, Ms. Kumar that I should not.  In my judgment, such an analysis will not be necessary in most cases.  As the cited passage demonstrates, ‘the issues that could be raised under Article 20 are amply reflected in the operation of article 13(b)’ which ‘ensures that the court is not acting in a way which is incompatible with the ECHR’.  A proper analysis under Article 13(b), applying the <span style="font-style:italic">Re. S </span>approach, should ensure compliance with Articles 2 and 3.  However, there may be cases where an Article 2 or 3 analysis illuminates the Article 13(b) analysis. If the Court considers the risk on return is sufficient to meet the threshold of ‘inhuman and degrading treatment’ – or worse - then the effectiveness of the protective measures to address that risk will need to be commensurate with the gravity of that risk.  ‘The clearer the need for protection, the more effective the protective measures must be’: above, paragraph 33.4.  In my judgment, there will be cases where it is appropriate for the Court to consider the Article 2 or 3 case-law when conducting the Article 13(b) analysis.</p>

Ms. Kumar did argue that I should not make positive findings of domestic abuse, however.  She noted that there was no contemporaneous medical evidence or police reports to corroborate M’s allegations.  I reject that submission and find, on the balance of probabilities, that M was the victim of domestic abuse, including coercive and controlling behaviour, by F since at least January 2020 and that her removal of TKJ and flight to the United Kingdom was effected in order to escape that abuse.

F accepts that he sent these messages but submits they should be seen in context, namely that they were sent at a time when he was deeply upset by M’s unlawful removal of TKJ and he also sent other messages which were not abusive.  I reject that.  The fact that F was understandably upset about the abduction of his daughter does not justify the use of such vile and threatening language to M and her family members.

I have found that M was the victim of domestic abuse comprising violent, coercive and controlling behaviour by F since, at the latest, January 2020 and that her removal of TKJ and flight to the United Kingdom was effected in order to escape that abuse.  I have also made assumptions for the purposes of Article 13(b), namely that F has problems with alcohol and he also subjected M to sexual abuse: above, paragraphs 47-48. The domestic abuse has resulted in M suffering from an adjustment disorder which is likely to deteriorate if M is returned to Italy, in particular if adequate protective measures are not in place: above, paragraph 49.  In that event, there is a grave risk M’s ability to parent TKJ will be compromised, placing TKJ in an intolerable situation.  Furthermore, TKJ has herself witnessed M being subjected to violent and abusive behaviour, including the incident in January 2020 when she accidentally sent the video of blood on the floor to M’s friend.  I find that TKJ is likely to have been psychologically harmed by that abuse and there is a grave risk she will suffer further harm if such abuse was to continue.  TKJ will also be at risk from F due to his alcohol problem, for example if he drives with her as a passenger while intoxicated.</p>

In those circumstances, and given what is now known about the aetiology of abusive relationships, M will be highly vulnerable to F’s attempts to resume the relationship.  It is likely that F will make such attempts, as witness his text message to M on 14 February 2023, ‘I still love you’.  As I observed in <span style="font-style:italic">Re.</span><span> </span><span style="font-style:italic">EF</span>, ‘the insidious nature of coercive and controlling relationships is such that the victim remains vulnerable to the abuser’s influence and will often return to the abusive relationship’: [65].

They will be living a short distance away in a flat paid for by F and largely dependent on maintenance payments from F.

F has already initiated criminal proceedings against M, however, and is unable to confirm whether the prosecution will be continued even if he does withdraw his complaint.  Prosecution may – as in England and Wales – be a matter for the Italian authorities, not the complainant.  This is a matter that would need to be clarified before any return could be implemented, but I will proceed on the assumption that the criminal proceedings are withdrawn.</p>

He will live at his mother’s address 1.5 kilometres away.  Mother says the property is inappropriate.  F says he cannot afford to rent another property in addition.  F also points out that M will be entitled to welfare benefits in Italy.  TKJ will return to nursery school, so presumably M would also be able to work part-time as a cleaner, as she does in England.  I take into account M’s evidence that F is bankrupt and has not paid any maintenance since she removed TKJ in December 2022.

            <p class="Appendix">MBL spoke to the police call handler on 16 December 2022 and is recorded as saying the following:</p>
            <p class="Appendix">‘In Italy the suspect drank often and beat her and ‘hurt her’.  He took a knife and said he would kill her with the knife, in front of their children.  He said that he had friend [sic] in police and that he could hurt her, thrown her from a balcony or anything.  He told her that his connections to police would protect him.  The suspect is in Italy at the moment.  He has messaged caller to say that he will kill caller and his family.  Caller thinks that suspect knows that [M] is at his house. … Suspect has said that he will go to [REDACTED] and kill [M]’s mother.’</p>
            <p class="Appendix">Police then attended on 19 December 2022, with an interpreter.  The note of attendance records: </p>
            <p class="Appendix">‘[M] has come to UK as she has been in a relationship for six years with, [F] who in the last four months has become abusive to her. [M], has stated the abuse became worse in the last two weeks to come to the UK and stated that in her home town in ITALY that [F] has threatened to kill her and then picked up a knife had it in his hand when threatening her. They share a child together [TKJ] who [M] has brought with her to the UK from ITALY in order to protect them both from [F]. [M] has not reported any of the abuse to the police in ITALY due to her believing they will not listen to her due to them being friends with [F]. [M] has stated that she is scared that he will come to the UK in order to get their child. [M] has also stated that [F] has informed the police of them both leaving Italy and states and she has been receiving abusive messages from him in audio and message. These kind of messages have also been sent to [MBL] as well. [F] has stated, he is going to fuck them and come to the UK for his child. The whole family is saying that they are all concerned with him coming to the UK however he does not know the address they are staying at but they believe that he will be able to find it. [M] is going to contact the council to be able to get housing and gain custody of her child is her main concern. [M] has also stated that she has no evidence of the offences that occurred in Italy.’</p>
