Such characteristics may well be demonstrated by the detainee having done good works for the benefit of others.  Examples would be acting as a Listener (helping vulnerable prisoners), helping disabled people use prison facilities, raising money for charities, and helping to deter young people from crime.  Again, ideally, there would need to be evidence of sustained involvement in more than one prison over a lengthy period.</span></p>
