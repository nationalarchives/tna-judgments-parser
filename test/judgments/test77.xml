Paragraph 19 of the Grounds of Appeal explains that an assessment that is out of time falls to be corrected regardless of whether any section 80 VATA claim has been made. For the purposes of the preliminary issues the Appellant does not rely on any section 80 claim. Unjust enrichment is not relevant to the time bar issue.</p>

However, in oral submissions her primary stance was to the effect that, “in stark terms”, the Appellant was asking the Tribunal to allow an appeal in relation to an assessment to tax, which was properly due, and which had not been appealed. Her starting point was that the Appellant had not taken a point that had not been pled but rather that there was no appeal before the Tribunal in relation to supplies to publically funded individuals. It was now out of time to lodge such an appeal.  </p>

Apart from the pleadings, she relied upon two letters in the correspondence. The first was from HMRC dated 22 March 2018, relating to a hardship application by the Appellant, HMRC wrote that “…we understand that only part of the above decision is under appeal….You do not dispute the remainder of the assessment”. She argued that that had never been challenged. </p>

Those appeals and the two letters all ante-dated both HMRC’s disclosure about the Disputed Periods and the New Grounds of Appeal.  I note the position in regard to the other appeals but they deal with other issues. I am not persuaded that those letters are of any relevance and if they are they carry very little weight. </p>

That paragraph certainly impliedly appealed the Disputed Periods. What it did not do was to specify the quantum.

More relevantly, I must weigh in the balance Mr Ripley’s argument that the New Grounds of Appeal, do not have to expressly address the full implications of a time bar.

Once that it is fixed that there is liability, it is antecedently highly improbable that the statute should not go on to make that Liability effective. A statute is designed to be workable; and the interpretation thereof by a Court should be to secure that object, unless crucial omission or clear direction makes that end unattainable. Now, there are three stages in the imposition of a tax: there is the declaration of liability, that is the part of the statute which determines what persons in respect of what property are liable. Next, there is the assessment. Liability does not depend on assessment. That, <span style="font-style:italic">ex hypothesi</span>, has already been fixed. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">But assessment particularises the exact sum which a person liable has to pay</span>.

Part of that balance is the requirement, in relation to … assessments outside the normal time limits, that HMRC satisfy the FTT that the relevant conditions for those assessments to have been validly made have been met. If HMRC fail to do so, for whatever reason, the fact that a taxpayer might escape tax that would otherwise have been due is simply the consequence of the operation of a system that provides such a balance.
