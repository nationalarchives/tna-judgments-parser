Regulation 7(2) identifies that the Ombudsman must not consider an application made outside the four week time period “unless the Ombudsman considers it just and equitable to allow the complainant to apply after that period.” The Claimant argues that in considering whether to exercise that discretion, the Ombudsman acted irrationally in not taking into account the merits of the Claimant’s underlying service complaint.  By contrast, the SCOAF and the Ministry of Defence submit that the terms of Regulation 7(2) mean that the Ombudsman was not entitled to take into account any consideration of the merits of the service complaint. </span></p>

That said, it is fair to recognise that the solution the Claimant proposed would necessarily involve the Defendant having to accept the correctness of the Claimant’s interpretation of Regulation 7(2) of the 2015 Regulations, as compared with the interpretation that the Defendant and Interested Party submit is correct.  Their argument is that the Ombudsman is simply not entitled, as a matter of law, to consider the underlying merits of the Claimant’s service complaint when deciding whether it is just and reasonable to exercise a discretion to consider the Claimant’s application for review out of time. This is the principal issue which falls for determination by this claim.</span></p>

In the present cases, however, it has not been shown that the MOD has suffered significant evidential prejudice as a result of the claimants' delay in bringing the proceedings. In these circumstances it seems to me legitimate to take into account in deciding whether to exercise the discretion to extend time the fact that a refusal to do so would prevent the claimants from obtaining any redress for proven violations of their fundamental human rights not to be subjected to inhuman or degrading treatment and not to be unlawfully and arbitrarily detained.”</span></p>

The Claimant has brought proceedings against the Interested Party in the ET alleging disability discrimination. As alluded to already, the Interested Party is arguing in those proceedings (amongst other things) that because the Claimant’s service complaint was decided to be inadmissible, and the SCOAF decided not to review that decision because the application to do so was made out of time, the Claimant is not entitled to bring his claim in the ET by virtue of section 121 of the EA 2010.  However, the Interested Party is also advancing an argument that the jurisdiction of the ET is excluded in any event by reason of paragraph 4 of Schedule 9 to the EA 2010,  and the provisions relating to the exclusion of disability discrimination claims against the Armed Forces in the circumstances specified.  The Claimant is opposing both those arguments in the ET proceedings.

Accordingly, the SCOAF had accepted that the substance of these HoC were not the same as earlier service complaints and potentially they were admissible complaints.

However, I do not consider your reasons to be compelling enough to account for the delay between the occurrence of the issue raised (your discharge in Oct 22) and the submission of your SC (14 Feb 2022).  This is a significant period to have elapsed in the context of the alleged wrong (loss of your Army career) and it is reasonable to expect that you should have taken action sooner to address this.  I note that you submitted your Annex F having stated that <span style="font-style:italic">“the appeal never came through till now”</span> but have not provided any evidence relating to this.  Again, given the severity of the issue, I struggle to understand why you allowed such a significant period of time to pass before taking any action.</p>

I told her about what had happened after I made the Service Complaint, ie that it had been deemed inadmissible on the basis that it was out of time.  To the best of my recollection she did not ask me about my knowledge of the Service Complaints process or about the Ombudsman process, nor did she ask me to provide reasons for why my request for review had been submitted late.  She also did not ask any questions about my ongoing case in the Employment Tribunal.  She asked me to provide documents, and on 22 June 2023, she followed up this request with an email.

He also claims that it fundamentally undermines the aims of the SCOAF of providing overview, and of ensuring the fairness of the service complaint system. He argues this was an obvious case of plain unfairness and unlawfulness to the Claimant, and in refusing an extension of 10 days, the SCOAF acted contrary to its own commitments. In short, he contends that by reason of a procedural technicality of time, the SCOAF refused to consider a far greater potential injustice to the Claimant.</span></p>

The Defendant’s principal argument (developed with conspicuous clarity and succinctness by Mr Cohen at the hearing) is a short and straightforward one.  The Defendant submits that the words used in Regulation 7(2) do not entitle her to consider the merits of the putative application for review as part of any assessment of whether it would be just and equitable to allow an application out of time. The Defendant submits that the wording of Regulation 7(2) means that the consideration of whether it would be just and equitable to allow the application to proceed “is logically prior to considering the application” and argues that Regulation 7(2) contains a deliberate inversion in contrast to other statutory regimes which are not so limited.   On this basis, so the Defendant submits, the Ombudsman did not err in law in not considering the merits of the Claimant’s application for review of the admissibility decision because she was precluded in law from doing so.</span></p>

It is only after this prohibition is imposed that the qualification appears “unless the Ombudsman considers it is just and equitable to allow the complainant to apply after that period”.

The Regulation begins by articulating a prohibition on the Ombudsman from considering an application that is made out of time.   That is clear from the mandatory words that the Ombudsman “must not consider an application” which is made outside the four week period identified.  That prohibition, however, is immediately qualified by the word “unless” used in the same sentence.  The qualification is “unless the Ombudsman considers it is just and equitable to allow the complainant to apply after that period.”</span></p>

But the intended breadth of the discretion is put beyond doubt by the fact that the Regulation makes it clear that the question of what is just and equitable is a matter for the Ombudsman.  The qualification is expressed as “unless the Ombudsman considers it is just and equitable”.  The Regulation is therefore affording the Ombudsman a discretion to consider whether it is just and equitable to extend time. These words of themselves indicate the provision of a broad discretion, without needing to draw on other statutory regimes where similar concepts (such as in s.123 of the EA 2010, or s.7(5) of the Human Rights Act 1998 on what is equitable) have been found to give rise to a broad discretion.  Reference to use of similar words giving rise to broad discretions in other contexts potentially reinforce the conclusion I reach on the wording used in Regulation 7(2), but I reach that conclusion simply on the words used in that provision itself.</span></p>

No express constraints, limits or other words of qualification are applied to what factors the Ombudsman may take into account, or the weight to apply to such factors.

To suggest that one cannot consider the underlying application at all because of the preceding prohibition on doing so where it is out of time, in circumstances where the prohibition is being expressed in the very same sentence that contains the qualification to the prohibition is, in my judgment, artificial and unrealistic.  It is artificial to suggest that the intention of a single sentence, expressed in the way it is, requires one to shut out any consideration of the application at all when making a decision on whether it is just and equitable to allow the complainant to apply after the time limit.  If such a restriction had been intended, it could have been much more clearly expressed, and I would expect it to have been done so if imposing restrictions on the discretion afforded.</span></p>

On the hypothesis advanced, the Ombudsman would still be required to consider whether it is just and equitable to allow the complainant to apply after the time limit has expired (before considering the application itself).  But there is nothing in the statutory language used which prevents the Ombudsman from considering the potential merits of the Claimant’s case (without determining any question of admissibility) in making an assessment of whether it is just and equitable to allow the complainant to apply out of time.  Thus, for example, the Ombudsman could, potentially decide it is just and equitable to allow a complainant to apply out of time (having regard to the merits of a complaint’s case), but then subsequently to reject  the application itself and uphold the inadmissibility decision in due course. </span></p>

True it is that the Ombudsman’s review function of admissibility decisions is a more limited one than that of carrying out an investigation of the service complaint itself.  But there is no obvious reason why the Ombudsman’s general discretion to allow a complaint out of time is intended to be limited or constrained in the way that the Defendant and Interested Party suggest, so as to preclude any consideration of the merits of a complainant’s case.  That is particularly so where admissibility decisions in this context can have potential significant consequences for a complainant.  There is no reason to think that the Ombudsman cannot be entrusted to exercise a broad “just and equitable” jurisdiction to extend time in a careful manner, with proper regard to the importance of respecting the four week time limit.  In that respect, although I reject the notion that what the Defendant describes as the inverted structure of Regulation 7(2) has the effect for which the Defendant contends, it does lend force to the principle that the starting point is the prohibition on considering complaints made outside the four week period, so that the exercise of the discretion will be the exception rather than the rule.</span></p>

I recognise the force of the submissions from the Defendant and Interested Party that one needs to be very careful in applying principles expressed in respect of different statutory regimes where the wording is different.

In general, there is now a well-established principle in administrative law that unless a potentially material consideration is a mandatory one required to be taken into account by law or policy, or it is so obviously material that it would be an error of law not to take it into account, it will be a matter of judgment for the decision-maker as to whether or not it is taken into account in a particular case: see eg </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">R(Khatun) v Newham LBC </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">[2004] EWCA Civ 55 [2005] QB 7</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> (</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">applying the approach expressed in the New Zealand case of </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">Creed NZ) </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">as applied in a number of other areas of administrative law).</span></p>

The Ombudsman acted on an erroneous understanding of the effect of Regulation 7(2). She treated it as precluding her ability to take into account the merits of the Claimant’s application for review, such that no decision was ever made by her as to whether or not those merits should be taken into account in this particular case.  This is therefore not a case where that error can be said to have made no difference, or that it is highly likely that error was not material to outcome of the decision.  Equally, however, the discretion under Regulation 7(2) is one for the Ombudsman to exercise, rather than this Court. I agree with the Defendant that if the Ombudsman is found to have erred in the way I have identified, then the decision falls to be remitted for the Ombudsman to take in accordance with the law.</span></p>

It is not appropriate for this Court to arrogate for itself that statutory function which belongs to the Ombudsman.   As to the arguments based on procedural failings that were expressed under Ground 1, but also pursued under the new Ground 3, I will deal with those under Ground 3.</span></p>

He contends that on any preliminary view of the detail submitted by the Claimant it would have been immediately plain that he was subjected to the most serious disability discrimination and that the original inadmissibility decision was wrong, the failure to treat it as a discrimination complaint was wrong and the decision to rely so heavily on a 10 day delay to refuse outright to consider the matter further was a far too severe and disproportionate sanction in all the circumstances of the case.</span></p>

The Claimant is correct that Regulation 7(2) is concerned with whether the Ombudsman considers it just and equitable for an application to be made out of time, not whether the reasons advanced by a complainant are considered to be just and equitable. The reasons for a delay might not be “just and equitable”, in the sense that the Ombudsman concludes that they were not sound reasons for delaying, but the Ombudsman  might still come to the view in a particular case that it is still just and equitable for the application to be considered.  There is a danger that the Ombudsman will not approach her discretion correctly if the words “just and equitable” are applied to the reasons given for the delay, rather than applied to an assessment overall.  This danger was particularly relevant in this case, where the Ombudsman considered herself not entitled to consider the merits of the application itself, and so was artificially inhibiting the potential scope of her assessment as to what she considered to be “just and equitable”. </span></p>

The Claimant could therefore have advanced the new Ground 3 from the outset.  This ground of claim might then have been legitimately reinforced by the Claimant upon the late disclosure of the Operations Manual, but there was no reason why the Claimant could not have put forward Ground 3 from the outset.  Failing that, on receipt of the Defendant’s witness statement dated 26 January 2024, the Claimant could have made its application for amendment earlier than he did, with the potential for the Defendant then to have had a greater (albeit limited) opportunity to respond with evidence.  The failure to articulate the new Ground 3 earlier has caused prejudice to the Defendant in being able to respond with evidence in time for the claim, and the Court in being able to consider such evidence.</span></p>

Accordingly, assuming that there was a failure on the part of the Defendant in not following the Operations Manual by requiring an Investigations Officer to contact the Claimant to establish the reasons for the delay in making the application, I am satisfied that no prejudice arose from any such failure.  The Claimant has not articulated what he would have added of substance to what he had already identified in his application form and accompanying documentation. The question as to whether the Ombudsman acted lawfully in limiting her consideration of that material is a different one addressed under Ground 1.  But I cannot see anything of significance that would have been established by the Investigations Officer contacting the Claimant in this particular case.  To like effect, if there was a failure to comply with what was stated in the emails of 22 June 2023 and 23 June 2023, there was also no prejudice that arose. </span></p>
