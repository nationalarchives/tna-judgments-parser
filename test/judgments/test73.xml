            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">This judgment relates to a further instalment of the Lehman saga arising out of the collapse of the Lehman Brothers group in 2008. More particularly, it arises out of the unusual circumstance of the process of administration having resulted, not in deficiency, but in considerable recoveries in excess of the claims of unsubordinated creditors. It concerns the priority as between subordinated creditors in the distributing administration of Lehman Brothers Holdings Plc (“PLC”) after payment of or provision for unsubordinated liabilities in full (including statutory interest). The particular issue raised is whether a subordinated creditor having priority as to principal is entitled to be paid statutory interest in priority to repayment of principal on another subordinated claim ranking lower in the queue.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">PLC, which is an intermediate holding company within Lehman’s UK group structure, has been in a distributing administration since 2 May 2014. Its administrators (“the PLC JAs”) have declared and paid a number of dividends totalling approximately £1,074.7 million, which have now discharged 100% of the principal value of unsecured, non-preferential, unsubordinated creditors. In addition, the PLC JAs have paid 44.6% (or £354.1 million) of the accrued statutory interest on claims to the unsubordinated creditors.</p>

          <num>3.</num>
          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">An updated estimated outcome statement published by the PLC JAs on the PLC website as of June 2023 indicated a base case recovery for subordinated creditors of some £233 million and a high case recovery of some £490 million. It is common ground that, though considerable, these funds are not enough to satisfy all subordinated claims. Issues of priority as between different classes of subordinated debt have arisen accordingly.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Mr Allison characterised the broader interpretation advanced by GP1 and DB as misconceived. He submitted that the premise of their argument “necessarily assumes that the draftsperson of Claim D departed from the statutory starting point (i.e., that statutory interest ranks junior to proved debts) and has subsumed statutory interest at the same level of subordination as the Subordinated Liabilities (i.e., subordinating it at the same level as the Notes and Liabilities ranking <span style="font-style:italic">pari passu </span>with them)”. He dismissed this premise as making no commercial or regulatory sense: and that no commercial or regulatory reason has been identified by DB and GP1 as to why a regulatory subordinated instrument should include within the scope of its subordination provision a Liability which (a) does not have the subordinated instrument as the legal source of the obligation, and (b) is already deeply subordinated by statute, such that it already ranks below the subordinated instrument as a matter of law. Whilst claims to principal and contractual interest arise under the Notes and therefore need to be subordinated to fulfil a clear regulatory purpose, statutory interest does not arise under the Notes, and is already subordinated by statute to all proved debts, including the Notes themselves.</p>

He suggested that “the absurdity of subsuming statutory interest on Claim D as a <span style="font-style:italic">Subordinated </span>Liability” is underscored by the “commercial oddity” that on the wider interpretation contended for by GP1 and DB, statutory interest on Claim D would rank above statutory interest on other subordinated debts, even where those debts are expressed to rank <span style="font-style:italic">pari passu </span>with Claim D.</p>

In particular, neither accepted that statutory interest on Claim D fell within the definition of <span style="font-style:italic">Excluded Liabilities</span> for the purposes of Claim C. Rather, statutory interest constituted, as the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">ECAPS1</span> had already held in the case of principal, a liability <span style="font-style:italic">“in respect of…the Notes” </span>ranking <span style="font-style:italic">pari passu </span>with principal. If, as is clear, statutory interest cannot be classified as an <span style="font-style:italic">Excluded Liability </span>for the purposes of the definition in Claim C, it is of no avail for LBHI to resort to and pray in aid the subordination provisions of Claim D: LBHI cannot succeed if Claim C has agreed to stand behind Claim D in respect of statutory interest as well as principal; and Claim C must be taken so to have agreed if statutory interest is not an <span style="font-style:italic">Excluded Liability. </span>But even if resort is made to the subordination provisions of Claim D, there is no inaptness, incongruity or violence done to the language or scheme of the subordination provisions in Claim D to characterise statutory interest as within the definition of <span style="font-style:italic">Subordinated Liabilities</span>, so that on that basis too it is to be treated as having the same priority over Claim C as has Claim D’s entitlement to repayment of principal.</p>

              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">The decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Waterfall I </span>is determinative of this case. In <span style="font-style:italic">Waterfall I</span>, the subordination clauses in the loan agreements concerned (revolving credit facilities) were in exactly the same terms as those in Claim C (see [40]).  Lord Neuberger PSC concluded (at [56]) that statutory interest (a) was a Liability payable by the company, which (b) fell within the definition of <span style="font-style:italic">Senior Liabilities </span>which (c) <span style="font-style:italic">“under the terms of the loan agreements…enjoys priority over the repayment of subordinated debt”</span>. That makes clear that (i) statutory interest need not all be paid at the same time, irrespective of how the underlying claims rank, (ii) it is perfectly possible for the terms of a loan agreement to accord priority in respect of statutory interest, and (iii) the effect of the provisions was to do just that. Ranking is to be determined as between two claimants by reference to the subordination provisions governing their lending, not according to whether they are subordinated or unsubordinated as a matter of composite description. Just as Claim D could not be proved before payment in full of <span style="font-style:italic">“Senior Liabilities” </span>in the form of unsubordinated debt (including statutory interest and non-provable liabilities) so too Claim C could not be proved until Claim D, as a <span style="font-style:italic">“Senior Liability” </span>had likewise been paid in respect not only of principal, but the other liabilities due to be satisfied. In this case, Claim D is a <span style="font-style:italic">Senior Liability </span>for the purposes of Claim C’s subordination provisions, in just the same way that the unsubordinated debts were <span style="font-style:italic">Senior Liabilities </span>for the purposes of the identical subordination provisions considered in <span style="font-style:italic">Waterfall I.</span> Ms Hilliard concluded (taking this from her skeleton argument) that</p>

              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">Further, IR 14.23(7) requires the same conclusion. <span style="font-style:italic">ECAPS1</span> established that the principal of Claim D ranks ahead of the principal of Claim C. It is clear, therefore, that Claim C will not be able to prove until the principal on Claim D has been proved and paid: that is a direct application of <span style="font-style:italic">Waterfall I </span>at [68] to [72]. As soon as principal on Claim D has been paid, IR 14.23(7) applies, and IR 14.23(7)(a) unambiguously mandates that surplus remaining after payment of proved debts <span style="font-style:italic">“must”</span> be applied in paying <span style="font-style:italic">“interest on those debts</span>” (i.e. on Claim D), <span style="font-style:italic">“before being applied for any other purpose” </span>(e.g. paying the principal on Claim C). On that basis, there is no need, for the purposes of determining the priority issue in this case, to consider the subordination provisions in Claim D: IR 14.23(7) provides a complete answer to the effect that (subject to solvency and the availability of surplus immediately afterwards) statutory interest is mandated to be paid next and immediately after principal on Claim D has been proved and paid.</p>

Claim C stands in the same position vis-à-vis Claim D as Claim D stands vis-à-vis unsubordinated creditors. There is nothing in LBHI’s argument that, on analysis, Claim D expresses statutory interest to rank “junior” to the principal of Claim D: there is no such “expression” in Claim D of juniority to Claim C. Further, the requirement in IR 14.23(7) that statutory interest can be paid on Claim D only out of surplus following the payment of the principal on Claim D (which reverses the ordinary rule that a creditor may apply any payment first to outstanding interest) at most stipulates that on the same claim principal has priority over statutory interest, and does not in any way denote subordination to payment of principal on a separate and subordinated claim (here, Claim C).</p>

              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">Further and in any event, she submitted that LBHI’s argument is flawed by circularity. IR 14.23(7)(a) provides that statutory interest must be paid “<span style="font-style:italic">after payment of debts proved</span>”. But Claim C will be a debt proved only once PLC’s more senior ranking liabilities have been satisfied. That is the effect of the contractual subordination of Claim C to Claim D. This then begs the question: is statutory interest on Claim D to be paid before Claim C? If it is, then Claim C cannot be proved and the statutory interest on Claim D must be paid. If it is not, Claim C can be proved. But the answer to the question of whether statutory interest on Claim D ranks for payment before Claim C must be answered before IR 14.23(7)(a) can apply. LBHI’s argument can only work by assuming the answer that it wants to arrive at; and is inherently circular.  In short, IR 14.23(7)(a) does not contain an expression of junior ranking for statutory interest generally because its effect is always subject to contractual subordination.</p>

The regulatory considerations and concerns which require that unsubordinated claims should be insulated in all respects from subordinated claims, and thereby signal and require that no payments should be made to subordinated claims unless and until any entitlements relating to unsubordinated claims have been satisfied in full, have no application in the context of subordinated claims.

I do not accept Mr Allison’s submissions that it denotes and is limited to a liability which has its source in contract, nor his submission (to the same effect) that it is limited to claims “under” the Notes. I see no sufficient reason not to accord the phrase its usual broad meaning, and to proceed on the basis that the draftsman’s choice of that phrase (rather than the word ‘under’) should be respected and given effect.</p>

My reservation, which underpins my preference for the contractual solution, is that in another case, there might be inconsistency with the contract: that is not this case and I need not decide what should then be done; but the parties having all accepted that IR 14.23(7) may be modified in its effect by contractual provision suggests that the contract would prevail.</p>

However, and as I have also previously noted, Lord Neuberger did not have to and did not consider any issue arising in the different context of a competition between subordinated but provable claims <span style="font-style:italic">inter se. </span>The emphasis of his judgment is on the necessity of according priority to unsubordinated debts over subordinated debts, such priority being inherent in their descriptions (what Lord Neuberger called their “eponymous nature”), clear from the terms of each as considered in <span style="font-style:italic">Waterfall I</span>, and necessary to fulfil regulatory objectives.<span style="font-style:italic"> </span>The position when the competition is between subordinated claims is more nuanced.</p>

The common ground between the parties that IR 14.23(7) does not override and must be read subject to contractual subordination provisions, supports the same conclusion. </p>

It follows that Ms Hilliard’s “second route” is not an alternative solution, but an exposition of the support in authority for the primacy of contractual subordination provisions, leading to the conclusion that, albeit without the regulatory overlay which contextualised <span style="font-style:italic">Waterfall I</span>, statutory interest on Claim D comes before the repayment of principal on Claim C.</p>

She submitted, in answer, that there should be no difference, since “Claim C stands in precisely the same position vis-à-vis Claim D as Claim D stands vis-à-vis the unsubordinated creditors. There is, and LBHI has identified, no principled point of distinction.” She noted that LBHI had sought to reach a different conclusion in reliance on the subordination provisions in Claim D: but that is an erroneous approach because (a) it has already been determined in <span style="font-style:italic">ECAPS1</span> that Claim D ranks ahead of Claim C, and that is “the end of the matter”, and (b) the subordination provisions in Claim D do not refer to statutory interest, do not say anything expressly about where statutory interest on Claim D ranks, but do on their true interpretation provide for the entitlement to statutory interest in respect of Claim D to be subordinated only to the same extent as Claim D itself (and no further). She also made again her submission that in the Claim C subordination provisions, which primarily and (she contends) exclusively determine Claim C’s position in the queue, Claim C is expressed to rank junior to all of PLC’s Liabilities except <span style="font-style:italic">“Excluded Liabilities”</span>; and since on no possible construction of Claim D is statutory interest <span style="font-style:italic">“expressed” </span>to be junior to Claim C, it cannot fall within that definition.</p>

All the more so, to my mind, given the function of statutory interest which is to serve as compensation for the delay after the commencement of the administration until paying out on <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">proved </span>debts <span style="font-style:italic">“for the periods during which they have been outstanding since the relevant date</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="7"><p class="FootnoteText" style="margin-left:0.39in"> Defined in IR<span> </span>14.1(3), and in this context meaning the date on which the company entered administration.</p></authorialNote><span style="font-style:italic">” </span>(IR 14.23(7)(a)).

A party to a res judicata will be estopped, as against any other party, from disputing the correctness of the decision, except on appeal. This is known as “cause of action estoppel”. The same is true—save to a narrower extent—of “issue estoppel”.

I would not accept that it is necessary, before abuse may be found, to identify any additional element such as a collateral attack on a previous decision or some dishonesty, but where those elements are present the later proceedings will be much more obviously abusive, and there will rarely be a finding of abuse unless the later proceeding involves what the court regards as unjust harassment of a party. It is, however, wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive. That is to adopt too dogmatic an approach to what should in my opinion be a broad, merits-based judgment which takes account of the public and private interests involved and also takes account of all the facts of the case, focusing attention on the crucial question whether, in all the circumstances, a party is misusing or abusing the process of the court by seeking to raise before it the issue which could have been raised before.

She went on to submit that perhaps having not found much success in the previous cases, LBHI had simply concluded that the point was worth a run as a “last roll of the dice”, and that taking such a late point as a final expedient was an abuse. She submitted that this was especially so where (as was the case here) the PLC JAs had asked all concerned before the <span style="font-style:italic">ECAPS1 Proceedings </span>to consider carefully whether there were any other points to raise. When I pressed her on this, Ms Tolaney clarified that she did not need to go so far as to suggest and was not suggesting, that there was any deliberate decision by LBHI to hold back the point; she submitted that all she needed to establish was that <span style="font-style:italic">“they are [were] aware of the point and therefore could and should have brought it.” </span></p>

            <intro>
              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">There was, at the time of both <span style="font-style:italic">ECAPS1 proceedings</span>, considerable legal and economic uncertainty as to the quantum of prospective funds in the PLC estate, and correspondingly, as to whether any funds would be available for any subordinated claims. That depended upon whether there would be any amounts paid to PLC by LBHI2 and thus upon the outcome of LBHI2’s application. Put shortly, PLC had to win on the issue raised in the LBHI2 Application in order to be able to pay anything at all to its subordinated creditors. If PLC had not won on that issue, the outstanding substantive issue in these proceedings would not have arisen. This was graphically illustrated in the Lehman Funds Flow Chart dated 15 November 2019 (“the Funds Flow”) which was handed up at first instance in the <span style="font-style:italic">ECAPS1 Proceedings </span>(and is appended to this judgment as Appendix 1); the range was summarised in the PLC JAs’ Progress Report dated 10 October 2019 where it was stated that:</p>

                <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:1in"><span style="font-style:italic">“PLC currently estimates that it may make no significant recoveries (in which case its unsecured unsubordinated creditors will not receive full statutory interest) or may have up to £600m as a surplus after payment in full of unsecured unsubordinated creditors plus statutory interest.”</span></p>

              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">All parties acknowledged that there was a possibility that PLC’s subordinated creditors might receive nothing at all. Such was the uncertainty and the range of possible outcomes that there was a debate among the parties in early 2018 as to whether the issues raised by PLC in <span style="font-style:italic">ECAPS1</span> should be raised for determination at all at that time or whether the proceedings should be confined to an application by the administrators of LBHI2 to determine priority between Claim B and Claim A. Ironically, both DB and GP1 argued at the time that the ranking of subordinated debt at PLC should not be determined at all in <span style="font-style:italic">ECAPS1 </span>but rather should await determination of the ranking at LBHI2. Furthermore, DB argued in <span style="font-style:italic">ECAPS1 </span>that Claim C had been released in its entirety: and, had it been successful, that would have rendered Issue (1) moot even if funds flowed from LBHI2 to PLC.</p>

            <intro>
              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">In fact, it was not, for some time at least, the preferred approach of the respective JAs of LBHI2 and PLC that the PLC issues be adjudicated at the same time as the LBHI2 issues. It was principally LBHI which argued that the claims of PLC’s subordinated creditors should be determined together with the LBHI2 issues, given similarities between the ranking issues at LBHI2 and PLC. Their inclusion in the menu was the result of negotiation. It is clear from evidence filed by the PLC JAs that they ultimately agreed to the inclusion of the issue in light of the clearly delineated disagreement between the parties on the substantive issue as to the priority ranking of PLC’s subordinated obligations. Mr Geraghty, on behalf of LBHI, described this as follows:</p>

              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">The parties never debated statutory interest on subordinated debts, nor was any thought given to its inclusion on the ‘menu’ of issues for determination. There was no mention of IR 14.23(7). The focus as to the PLC estate was on priority of claims to principal: even these were uncertain to arise, and any potential for payment of statutory interest on subordinated debts was even more uncertain. The point could have been raised by any of the parties, but none did so. As stated in the PLC JAs’ skeleton argument in these proceedings:</p>

Of course, with hindsight, and with the benefit of knowing the flow of funds after the many uncertainties were resolved, it might have been more efficient for Issue (1) to have been dealt with as part of the <span style="font-style:italic">ECAPS1 Proceedings.</span> But that is, in my judgment, a long way from any conclusion that the matter should have been canvassed before such matters had been resolved.

Like the parties and the JAs of the various Lehman companies, the emergence of other issues has always been a known possibility, which has been accommodated by responsible use of a series of Applications under the specific statutory provisions enabling them and the adoption in respect of those applications of efficient and proportionate procedures for defining and confining the issues raised. Of course, this is not to say that the process is infinite; and I would hope and expect this round to be the last. However, I would have expected the court, as matters stood at the time of the <span style="font-style:italic">ECAPS1 Proceedings</span>, to have had in mind that there would be consequences which would throw up new issues which would have to be determined subsequently, as indeed the parties all expected.</p>
