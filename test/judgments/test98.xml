            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in">From time to time, the court finds itself in the position of having to investigate events which took place many years or even decades ago and where, because it was never anticipated at the time that those events would later become the subject of fevered litigation, no particular steps were taken to preserve contemporaneous documentation or to crystallise recollections.  Almost invariably, the key participants will have moved on, the memories of those remaining will have faded, and much of the oral evidence will come from people who either came much later to the story or were only peripherally involved (if at all) and can only speak in terms of general practice.  In such circumstances, the court must perforce do the best it can on such material as is available to it.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in">This is one of those cases.  The dispute arises out of the historic mis-selling of payment protection insurance (“<span style="font-weight:bold">PPI”)</span> over the period prior to 14 January 2005.  For convenience these will be referred to as the “<span style="font-weight:bold">pre-2005</span>”<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>policies.  (Quite what the exact starting point might have been, no-one was able to identify, although it was thought to be some time in the 1970s.)  The policies in question were underwritten by various predecessors of the Claimants (“<span style="font-weight:bold">AXA</span>”) as insurer, and sold as an adjunct to retail store cards by various predecessors of the Defendants (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Santander</span>”) as credit lender.  An important feature of this case is that for much of the relevant period, the various insurance entities and credit lending entities were all part of the GE corporate group reporting to the same profit centre within GE.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in">As is well known, store cards are retailer-branded credit cards.  They were marketed by credit lenders to customers through high-street retailers and required the customer to make a minimum monthly repayment in respect of any outstanding balance on the card.  In return for a monthly premium added to the credit balance (typically 78 pence per £100 outstanding), PPI insurance could also be purchased, which typically covered some or all of the customer’s repayment obligations under the credit agreement in certain events, including, death, accident, illness, or redundancy.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="1"><p class="FootnoteText"> As premium was only charged by reference to the balance outstanding on the card, the amount could fluctuate depending on the extent to which the card was used.  Furthermore, accounts could come in and out of cover as and when the balance dropped to nil.</p></authorialNote>  Over time, additional benefits were often added, such as price protection (which reimbursed the customer if the purchased item was subsequently reduced in price within a specified period) and purchase protection (which covered accidental damage to purchased items within a specified period.)  </p>

          <content>
            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in">The marketing of store cards and any associated PPI product mainly took place in retail stores at the till, although some PPI sales were concluded later over the telephone.  The sales were conducted pursuant to arrangements made between the credit lender and the individual retailers and the insurer was not physically involved in the actual selling process.  The insurance itself was a fairly standard product, albeit with minor variations in cover for different stores.  No doubt reflecting this general division of input, around 95% of the policy premium remaining after payment of claims was typically paid to the credit lender while around 5% was retained by the insurer.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="2"><p class="FootnoteText"> See further paragraphs ‎50-‎52 below.</p></authorialNote></p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in">During the course of the late 1990s and early 2000s, complaints relating to the mis-selling of PPI generally began to increase, leading to a veritable explosion from around 2011/2012, which was undoubtedly fuelled by the involvement of more or less scrupulous claims management companies.  This ultimately resulted in redress being paid to hundreds of thousands of customers by way of premium refunds which, with interest, totalled some £38 billion across the industry for all forms of PPI.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="3"><p class="FootnoteText"> PPI was not, of course, only sold as an adjunct to store cards.  It was also sold, for example, in conjunction with mortgages and personal loans.</p></authorialNote>  Because of the way in which the regulatory regime worked (of which more anon) and notwithstanding that the complaints overwhelmingly related to the way in which the PPI had been sold rather than the product itself, it is AXA which has been required as inheritors of the insurer’s liabilities to bear the costs of this redress in respect of pre-2005 sales amounting to almost £500 million plus more than £70 million in respect of fees payable to the Financial Ombudsman Service (the “<span style="font-weight:bold">FOS</span>”) for complaints referred to the FOS, as well as the internal administrative costs of processing complaints.  </p>

This is because under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (“<span style="font-weight:bold">FSMA</span>”), the credit lenders themselves became regulated entities at that date in relation to their insurance mediation activities and, as such, were obliged by the regulators to take responsibility for any complaints arising out of policies sold thereafter. </p>

For that reason, complaints handling in relation to the pre-2005 policies was in fact undertaken on behalf of AXA by Santander, latterly pursuant to a Claims Handling Agreement (the “<span style="font-weight:bold">CHA</span>”) concluded in December 2017 (subsequently amended in December 2018).  Pursuant to the CHA, AXA has paid service charges of over £120 million to Santander.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.35in">For its part, Santander pursues two counterclaims.  The first is not controversial and relates to around £7 million deducted by AXA from sums otherwise payable to Santander pursuant to a profit-sharing agreement in the Agency Agreement.  AXA accepts that this sum should be set off against any award in its favour.  The second arises only if the Contribution Act is found to be applicable (Santander’s primary case being that it is not).  In that event, Santander asserts that it is entitled to recover some £151 million that it has itself paid directly to customers in respect of pre-2005 sales on the basis that responsibility should be apportioned in whole or in part to AXA’s predecessors.  A further unrelated counterclaim for rectification was conceded by AXA before trial and has now fallen away. </p>

It is unnecessary to draw any distinction between them and they were referred to collectively throughout the trial as “<span style="font-weight:bold">FICL/FACL</span>”.  Historically, FICL/FACL operated jointly under the trading name of GE Financial Insurance which was part of the GE Capital corporate group until it was transferred to the Genworth corporate group (“<span style="font-weight:bold">Genworth</span>”) in 2004.  Genworth was in turn purchased by AXA on 1 December 2015 at which point, the First Claimant inherited the business, rights and obligations of FICL while the Second Claimant inherited the business, rights and obligations of FACL.  Both Claimants are domiciled in France and carry on business as insurance underwriters within the AXA corporate group.  Again it is unnecessary to draw any distinction between them and I shall therefore refer in this judgment simply to FICL/FACL, Genworth and AXA as appropriate.</p>

GECB was originally part of the Debenhams corporate group before being acquired, first by the Burton group and subsequently, in July 1990, by the GE Capital corporate group.

AXA’s losses relate to over 650,000 individual customer complaints.  With the sanction of the court, the parties sensibly agreed to proceed on the basis of a statistical sampling exercise.  As a result, they have agreed that a sample of 771 complaint files (the “<span style="font-weight:bold">Complaints Sample</span>”) can be treated as representative of the total population of complaints in issue in the proceedings, such that it can be assumed that if a particular proportion of the Complaints Sample exhibits a particular category of mis-selling, the same proportion of the overall population will have been similarly mis-sold.  Various categories of mis-selling were also identified and the parties have agreed the correct categorisation of 469 files in full and a further 141 files in part.

Given the general paucity of documentation covering the early years of the relationship between the parties, it was easy for both parties to home in on isolated specific documents in order to challenge evidence given by the witnesses.  However, the fact that one or other party behaved in a particular way at one or more specific points in time clearly does not mean that it necessarily behaved consistently in that way over the entire or, indeed, any particular period of the relationship.  Put more simply, the fact that assertion X might be falsified in respect of one particular date does not logically lead to the conclusion that the converse proposition, Y, is established, let alone established as an invariable practice.  This is a point which obviously cuts both ways and I bear it well in mind in weighing the oral and documentary evidence.</p>

Santander, however, sought to impugn his credibility on the basis of AXA’s conduct in relation to the CHA and the (now-conceded) claim for rectification.  In simple terms, the parties had agreed that the service charges payable to Santander for handling claims under the CHA should be irrecoverable in all circumstances, the intention being to provide protection to both SCL and SISUK.  But due (as we now know) to an error on the part of Santander’s external counsel, the wording of the final agreement was changed in such a way as apparently to exclude SISUK from the scope of this protection, and AXA took advantage of this mistake in order to plead a claim for recovery of the service charges.

Indeed, it is quite possible that neither side fully appreciated the implications of the drafting change when the CHA was signed.  However, when proceedings came to be issued, I find that Mr Rember almost certainly suspected that Santander had made a mistake and potentially missed a trick of which AXA might be able to take advantage.  Given that Santander was as big a beast in the jungle as AXA and, moreover, a litigation opponent, I do not regard Mr Rember as having been under any obligation to draw the potential mistake to Santander’s attention.  He was entitled to assume that it could look after itself.  It was undoubtedly unsatisfactory that the claim was not withdrawn more promptly after Santander proffered an explanation in December 2021, but the point goes no further than that and I do not find that it casts doubt on Mr Rember’s evidence more generally. </p>

In so far as Mr Hazell gave evidence to the effect that they were not in fact always correct, he took no steps to say so at the time or to have them corrected, and I disregard that evidence which I find somewhat unsatisfactory.</p>

I found it somewhat implausible that he had not been made aware of the agreements reached between Genworth and Santander in 2012 and 2013 given the size of the sums involved, although he maintained that this was indeed so.

His recollection was patchy and did not always reflect the contents of his witness statement, although I do not necessarily criticise him for that as it is not unusual for dormant memories only to be triggered on being shown particular documents.  However, he was unnecessarily defensive and was seemingly so determined to give away as little as possible that he repeatedly refused in cross-examination to comment on any documents to which he was not himself party – even when he was being asked to accept no more than that they said what they said.  Despite being Head of Compliance, he disclaimed knowledge or responsibility for much of what was being discussed and agreed within Santander regarding PPI remediation.  This was on the basis that it was all being dealt with by the Remediation team led by Mr De La Vega and that the compliance team would only get involved in response to specific requests.  Towards the end of his evidence, however, he stated that he would have updated Mr De La Vega on the outcome of the 4 June 2015 meeting.  In answer to a query from the Bench as to why he had taken it upon himself to do this given what he had previously said about the separation between the two teams, he claimed that he had worked closely with Mr De La Vega and he would therefore have felt it appropriate to do so.  The suggestion of a close working relationship with Mr De La Vega had never previously been made in either his written or oral evidence and, indeed, was completely at odds with the thrust of his earlier testimony.  It was also noteworthy that, while Mr Hazell claimed to have had very clear opinions about where liability should sit for the pre-2005 complaints which frequently differed from the views expressed by others within Santander, yet there was no evidence that he ever challenged those different views, either orally or in writing.  Overall, I was left with the impression that the views he expressed in court were not necessarily views he expressed quite so trenchantly at the time.  I therefore treated his evidence with some caution where it was not supported by the contemporaneous documents.</p>

On top of that, it is in the nature of things that individual participants in the same event will approach matters from their own perspective and are accordingly likely to perceive and remember things in different ways which emphasise different aspects of what occurred.  For all these reasons it is entirely unsurprising that recollections may differ, and where this happens it is ultimately for the court to weigh the competing accounts as best it can in order to decide on a balance of probabilities what is most likely to have occurred.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in">GECB was the dominant provider and distributor of store cards in the UK and by 2004 had captured around 50%-70% of the market, representing some 12.5 million customers.  Many of these customers also purchased PPI policies which generated approximately £1 billion in premium.  The precise mechanics of selling were determined between GECB and each individual retailer and FICL/FACL had no involvement in the physical sales.  Indeed FICL/FACL were excluded from GECB’s relationship with the retailers (no doubt for reasons of confidentiality) and so had no direct contact either with them or with the end customers (unless and until a claim was made under the policy).  Moreover, GECB was reluctant to permit FICL/FACL to have access to its telemarketing centre in Leeds (described as the <span style="font-style:italic">“jewel in its crown”</span>) and attempts by FICL/FACL to get visibility over customer data and, for example, penetration rates,<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="6"><p class="FootnoteText"> The penetration rate refers to the proportion of insured balances and indicates the extent of PPI take-up by customers.</p></authorialNote> were generally either rebuffed or ignored.  Thus, FICL/FACL could not actively seek out customers for themselves and depended on policies being sold by GECB alongside the store cards.  It was not in dispute that in this respect GECB was acting as FICL/FACL’s agent and that the retailer was acting as a sub-agent of GECB.</p>

From this it would fund its own costs and expenses as well as any fees or costs payable under its retailer agreements albeit, on the evidence, the majority of these costs related to the store card credit lending aspects of the agreement, rather than the PPI product specifically.  There were thus clear advantages to GECB in selling as many policies as possible.  Not only was it profitable business in itself for GECB, but the PPI also protected GECB’s credit risk as it covered certain accidental and unforeseen events that might otherwise have affected the customer’s ability to service the loan.  In addition, as explained by Mr Blundell, profits from the sale of PPI could be used by GECB to expand its position in the credit market, for example by cross-subsidising its core lending product so as to offer more competitive interest rates than its competitors.</p>

For this reason, they were not in a position to understand what new types of cover might be attractive to potential customers or how existing products could be improved.  I am satisfied on the evidence that the design of new products and any proposed amendments or enhancements to cover was therefore almost entirely driven by GECB and that FICL/FACL were purely reactive to its requests.  This is consistent with the view expressed by the Insurance Ombudsman<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="7"><p class="FootnoteText"> In a speech delivered to the IBC Creditor Insurance Conference on 10 December 1997.</p></authorialNote> that it was lenders in the industry who designed PPI products.</p>

Notwithstanding that the companies were part of the same corporate group and that FICL/FACL operated effectively as captive in-house insurers which GECB was expected to use, GECB could in theory take its business elsewhere if FICL/FACL refused to accept its proposed terms and, according to Mr Halse, this always felt like a real possibility.  No doubt, as Mrs Greenaway said in her statement, the companies were working together with the shared goal of developing and maximising the business for the overall benefit of the GE group, but as Mr Brandon-Cross stated in his witness statement, FICL/FACL’s strategy was to work with GECB to sell PPI and boost income and profit <span style="font-style:italic">for GECB,</span> which was a separate corporate entity from FICL/FACL with separate accounts<span style="font-style:italic">.</span>  What is clear from the evidence is that FICL/FACL’s share of the pie was towards the lower end of the ranges which were regarded as normal in the industry at the time. </p>

FICL/FACL would frequently be asked to respond to a request from GECB within a matter of days so as to meet a planned launch date for the new scheme or product.  According to Mr Jones, GECB was much closer than FICL/FACL to the general GE culture of pushing to lead the market, win work and innovate.  That said, FICL/FACL had the last word on the terms and conditions of any policy, for example with regard to exclusions, and some 70% of their business was with other lenders mainly operating outside the store card market.  </p>

Mr Mothersdale expressed it thus in 1997: <span style="font-style:italic">“Among the more difficult of our clients is GCF, who, because they are a sister GE company and because of the personality involved are aggressively demanding and unreasonably intolerant at times.”</span>  Furthermore, GECB had very much the whip hand in all negotiations.  Credit lending was its core business and it had a huge share of the store card market, easily outstripping its competitors.  Only GECB had access to the retailers and the customers and only GECB was in a position to assess what products were likely to be attractive to end users and what would sell well.  In the absence of any customer data, FICL/FACL were unable to form any view on such matters.  Thus, it was GECB which effectively drove the design and pricing of products and FICL/FACL’s role was essentially relegated to that of finding a way of providing what GECB wanted.  Moreover, although FICL/FACL were not dependent on GECB for the majority of their income which (as already noted) came from outside the store card market, equally it represented a significant proportion of that income which could not readily be replaced were GECB to start dealing with another insurer.  I therefore reject the suggestion that GECB was a mere go-between or cipher interposed between FICL/FACL and the end customer. </p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in">The actual sales process is discussed in more detail later.  At this point, it need only be mentioned that the vast majority of PPI policies (around 95%) were sold at the point of sale by the retail staff of the relevant store at the same time as the customer completed a customer credit application form for a store card.  This was perceived as being by far the most efficient way to achieve take-up.  It almost invariably took place in public at the till while the customer was also purchasing goods from the retailer and customers were frequently offered a discount as an incentive to take out a store card.  Prior to 1994, PPI was generally sold on an “opt-out” basis where it was included in the transaction unless the customer positively indicated to the contrary.  However, such “negative option” selling was phased out from 1994, whereafter the credit application form for the store card included a section requiring the customer to indicate positively that he or she wanted cover, either by signing or ticking a box - so-called “opt-in” cover.  </p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in">It was not disputed that GECB’s primary concern was with its core lending business and that the focus of the transaction was therefore very much on the store card.  On GECB’s own estimate, typically only around 20-30 seconds was devoted by sales staff to selling PPI in what was generally a fast-paced and pressured environment, particularly during end-of-season sales or other busy times when there were lengthy queues at the tills.  It was also not disputed that sales staff were often part-time or temporary, for example students or teenagers doing weekend or vacation work, and that they were frequently incentivised to sell as many policies as possible.  Some stores nonetheless offered customers the possibility of going to a separate part of the store to consider and/or discuss the credit agreement and ancillary PPI before signing up.</p>

Sales by this means offered a somewhat greater opportunity to discuss the nature of the cover and explain its features.</p>

Certain exclusions, conditions, restrictions etc under a particular policy will be common to all policyholders, for example, a condition about fraud. In those circumstances, it would not be necessary to identify these other than by reference to general exclusions applying to all policyholders of a particular type of insurance, either orally or in policyholder documentation. </span></p>

An example would be where benefit to self-employed people is either excluded or severely restricted for redundancy cover under a creditor insurance policy. Clearly, self employed people should be made aware of this so they can decide whether the other benefits under the policy and the premium to be paid justifies taking out such a policy.</span></p>

Thereafter, the issue of mis-selling assumed ever greater prominence and on 30 January 2007, following an investigation commenced in 2005, the FSA issued a Final Notice to GECB requiring it to pay a penalty of £610,000 in respect of a variety of regulatory breaches in relation to PPI.  These included the failure to review, amend and then operate its sales procedures so as to ensure that all customers received adequate information about the policy before making a decision to purchase, failure to monitor sales practices effectively and remedy any non-compliance, and failure to amend its training procedures to ensure consistent application of sales processes by sales staff.

As indicated above, however, it has to be borne in mind that the documentary record was by no means complete and that the gaps were not necessarily filled by oral evidence.  For example, the earliest available document dates only from 1994 whereas some of the policies covered by this litigation were sold in the 1970s.  There were also frequent instances of a point being raised in correspondence without any indication of how it was eventually resolved.  And where, for example, there were only a few documents in which a question such as training was discussed, it was impossible to know whether that was because these were the only occasions when it was considered, or simply because they are the only records which survive.</p>

It was not in dispute that negative option sales were phased out across the entire industry in around 1994 because they were perceived to be unfair and consumer-unfriendly.  By then, the ABI and FLA Codes had both been adopted.</p>

On 2 September 1996, Mr Jones wrote a file note recording that the agency agreement was in the process of being signed and that ABI compliance was being discussed at the same time.  For reasons which no-one could explain, however, the agreement was never signed until it was eventually executed on 1 December 2000 in substantially similar terms to the previous draft, albeit not identical.</p>

Prior to 2012, FICL/FACL had minimal, if any, involvement in mis-selling complaints as these tended to be directed to GECB/Santander (with whom the customer had the credit relationship) who handled them in accordance with the FLA Code to which it was subject and paid redress where considered appropriate.  The only complaints that FICL/FACL received and processed directly were those relating to claims from customers under the policy itself, for example where a claim had been declined or the quantum of a claim payment was disputed.  However, some mis-selling complaints could reach FICL/FACL where the complaint was declined by GECB and was then referred by the customer to the FOS who in turn referred it to FICL/FACL as the sole regulated entities for pre-2005 policies.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in">From about 2012, the increasing number of referrals from the FOS concerning alleged mis-selling by GECB began to cause serious concern within FICL/FACL.  An internal Santander report into claims handling similarly noted that the level of PPI complaints was continuing to rise in response to increasing media coverage and interest from claims management companies and the amount of its provision for potential liabilities was also commensurately increased.  In a letter dated 13 March 2012 addressed to the Head of Partnership Management at SISUK, Mr Rember drew attention to the fact that Santander was declining around 90% of store card PPI complaints in contrast to its decline rate of only 10% for PPI policies overall.  He stated that initial discussions had been taking place with Alison Webdale of Santander’s Compliance team about how Santander was applying Appendix 3 of DISP, pointing out that there was now a <span style="font-style:italic">prima facie</span> assumption that any complaint about PPI mis-selling would be upheld by the distributor and appropriate redress paid.  He stated that Genworth had already received about 820 referrals from the FOS which was investigating a further 914 complaints.  He invited discussion on a strategy for handling both existing and future complaints, particularly bearing in mind that Genworth did not have any of the information necessary to process complaints and calculate appropriate redress.  He put forward two possible solutions, both of which assumed that Santander would be responsible for claims handling and payment of any redress.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in">This letter led to a debate within Santander as to how complaints were being handled which involved, variously, the teams dealing with Remediation and PPI (Rich Harris and Caroline Swan), Complaints (Mr Crowley), Compliance (Ms Webdale and Mr Hazell), SCL (Mrs Owen and Mr Atkinson), SISUK (Colin Greenhill) and Legal (Rob Worthington).  Internal emails identified that: (i) SCL (as the successor to GECB) was differentiating between pre- and post-2005 sales; (ii) it was declining complaints without FOS rights in relation to the former on the basis that GECB was not regulated in respect of these sales; (iii) it was instead referring dissatisfied customers to the FLA; (iv) if the customer nonetheless took the complaint to the FOS, this would lead to a referral to Genworth.  Such a differentiation between <span style="font-size:11pt">pre-2005</span> and post-2005 sales was in marked contrast to the approach adopted by the rest of the Santander group which had previously been regulated through membership of GISC.  It is also clear that the different approach taken by GECB was questioned by some and that Mr Crowley and others took the view that it should be abandoned so as to bring GECB in line with the wider Santander group which drew no distinction between the position before and after 2005.  Moreover, whatever the strict regulatory position, it was recognised that there might be an expectation on the part of the regulators that Appendix 3 of DISP should be applied to pre-2005 sales with customers being given FOS rights.  </p>

Nonetheless, on 2 May 2012 SCL sought approval from Santander’s ExCo to continue with its existing claims handling approach on the basis that this was justified by GECB’s regulatory position prior to 2005.  If approved, SCL proposed that the approach would then be notified to the FSA before Genworth could take the matter further.  Calculations showed that an uphold rate of 96% for complaints relating to pre-2005 sales would require an additional provision in the accounts of well in excess of £100 million – a matter which caused Mrs Owen, at least, some alarm.</p>

It seems that this position was also communicated in a call on the same day to the FSA which did not apparently object.  It was subsequently confirmed by emails dated 10 May 2012 from, respectively, Mr Worthington to Genworth and Mr Hazell to the FSA.

However, not everyone within Santander appears to have been aware of the agreement reached with Genworth in August 2012.  An internal email from Mrs Owen dated 9 October 2012 expressed concern that the financial implications of the agreement might not have been fully understood, and that there was a potential exposure of hundreds of millions of pounds should claims management companies get wind of the fact that Genworth was paying redress.  On the other hand, a gap analysis carried out by Santander in October 2012 expressed the view that the distinction between pre- and post-2005 sales, while legally justified, did not morally give good service to customers under the “treat customers fairly” principle and recommended removing it.</p>

In short, for every 1% increase in the uphold rate, a further £1.3 million would be required.  Thus, an uphold rate of 92% would require further provision of £118 million.  On 8 November 2012, Mr Harris (who was head of the Remediation and PPI Programme) confirmed that he was aware of the potential impact on provisioning and that changes were being made to the claims handling policy.

Be that as it may, it referred to a concern raised by the FOS at the start of the meeting that different review standards were being applied by Santander to pre- and post-2005 complaints.

Mr Hazell’s response was that he did not recall having discussed the question of FOS referrals after introduction of the new policy as the focus had only been on existing complaints and the need to agree a process to reduce the volume of future referrals.  His position was essentially that Genworth should start handling complaints in accordance with the new policy.  If it chose to pay redress outside the policy, Santander should not have to contribute.  Furthermore, if the FOS overturned a decision reached under the new policy, then liability rested with Genworth alone and it was a purely commercial decision for Santander whether it wished to contribute or not.  While he had previously been concerned that Santander’s previous approach to assessing complaints left it exposed to criticism, he felt this was no longer an issue under the new claims handling policy.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">This was the first occasion on which it had ever been suggested that Santander had only been making payments on a goodwill basis and the assertion was immediately challenged by Genworth.  On 22 May 2014, a conference call took place between Mr Rember and Mr McDonnell on behalf of Genworth, Mr Dewey of SISUK and Mr Schumann of Santander UK.  As recorded by Mr Dewey, Santander had two objectives: first, to consider settlement of Genworth’s outstanding invoices and, second, to understand the parties’ respective positions so that they could work towards progressing Project Tosca.  Santander offered to pay any remaining redress included in the outstanding invoices by offset against profit share.  Genworth agreed to consider this, although its preference was to deal with the issue in its entirety and not just limited to current invoices.  For its part Genworth explained that it was still receiving FOS referrals, albeit the volume was reducing.  It referred to the agreement reached in August 2012 for Santander to reimburse redress, FOS fees and administrative costs which it believed still applied and which Santander had not challenged until its letter of 6 May 2014.  In answer to Santander’s suggestion that the August 2012 agreement was only ever an interim arrangement pending introduction of the new process, Genworth maintained that the new process had never been intended to derogate from Santander’s continuing liability for pre-2005 complaints in principle but simply to remove Genworth (and, indirectly, Santander) from further exposure to FOS referrals.  However, this had not happened.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">Further correspondence in which the parties debated their respective positions did not resolve the matter and on 7 August 2014, Ms Day of Santander’s Legal team wrote again expressing disappointment that Genworth was refusing to co-operate in relation to the sale to NewDay.  She reiterated that Santander was under no regulatory responsibility in relation to pre-2005 claims and asserted what was said to be its definitive position, namely that it would continue to reimburse Genworth in respect of claims handled prior to 1 May 2013 when the new policy came into effect but not thereafter.  It would, however, continue to pay for cases where it was determined in accordance with the new policy that eligibility criteria were not met.  Mr Rember replied on 14 August 2014, challenging the underlying basis of Santander’s position but indicating that he was open to discussing a possible solution.  In her formal response dated 17 November 2014, Ms Day acknowledged that different people in different departments of Santander had been taking part in discussions with Genworth at different times and that this may have created an unhelpful degree of confusion.  She likewise indicated a willingness to meet on a without prejudice basis in order to find a mutually acceptable solution and draw a line under the matter.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">Eventually, the long-awaited meeting took place on 4 June 2015.  On behalf of Genworth it was led by Mr Rember and also attended by Mr McDonnell and Genworth’s Chief Risk and Compliance Officers.  True to their word, Ms Day and Mr Conway had arranged for the meeting to be attended on behalf of Santander by some very senior people.  It was led by Mr Pateman (the Executive Director and Head of UK Banking at Santander UK) with Mr Lloyd (Santander’s General Counsel), Mr Hazell (Director of Compliance), Ms Day and Mr Conway (both senior lawyers) and Ms Walters also in attendance.  Mr Pateman and Mr Lloyd were both members of Santander UK’s most senior executive management committee, ExCo, at the time.  It will be necessary to return to this meeting in the context of AXA’s primary case that a binding settlement was reached on that occasion.  For present purposes, it is sufficient to note that the parties agreed that Mr Rember’s note of the meeting circulated on 5 June 2015 correctly recorded that:</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">Genworth duly produced a first draft of the Settlement Agreement on 18 June 2015.  The details were then negotiated between the parties until a final version was agreed in late October 2015.  A claims handling agreement was also agreed in parallel, with finalisation subject to the signing of the Settlement Agreement.  By email dated 20 October 2015, Mr Conway asked Mr Rember to arrange for five copies of the Settlement Agreement to be executed by Genworth and then sent to Santander for signature by the appropriate companies.  Genworth did this on 22 October 2015.  However, despite increasingly frustrated chasing emails by Mr Rember met with equally frustrated apologies from Ms Day and Mr Conway, the Settlement Agreement was never signed by Santander.  It appears that Mr Pateman left Santander UK at the end of November to move to another role within the group and, according to Mr Conway’s email to Mr Rember of 19 November 2015, the directors who were authorised to sign in his place (knowing nothing about the background) had requested that the agreement be referred to ExCo for review and approval.  An ExCo meeting then took place on 25 November 2015 and it is one of life’s little ironies that none of the three executives who had attended the 4 June 2015 meeting (Messrs Pateman, Lloyd and Hazell<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="11"><p class="FootnoteText"> Although Mr Hazell later became a member of ExCo, he was not formally on the committee at the time.</p></authorialNote>) was present.

After noting that Santander’s internal governance procedures required ExCo to review the proposed settlement with Genworth following Mr Pateman’s departure, she stated that new information had come to light from the FOS which suggested that some of FICL/FACL’s PPI products were flawed, in particular in relation to so-called Budget Accounts.  According to Ms Day, the FOS had suggested that some of these products should never have been offered for sale at all.  If so, Santander believed the question of mis-selling was irrelevant and for this reason did not intend to proceed with the Settlement Agreement.  Ms Day appears to have been referring to the subject matter of a meeting between Genworth and the FOS some nine months earlier in April 2015, when the latter expressed concern that GECB’s Budget Account might not have represented good value for money as the premium was calculated as a percentage of the outstanding balance and customers buying this product typically only had very low balances.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">Unsurprisingly, Santander’s <span style="font-style:italic">volte face</span> was greeted by Genworth with dismay and, it is fair to say, outrage, not least because of GECB’s own close involvement in the design of the Budget Accounts and other PPI products offered for sale.  Meanwhile, the question of how claims should be handled going forward remained unresolved.  On 3 July 2017, Santander notified Genworth that it would no longer pay anything in respect of pre-2005 policies and on 31 July it stopped handling complaints in relation to such policies altogether.  This effectively left Genworth over a barrel.  Santander had handled all claims hitherto and Genworth did not have any of the information necessary to allow it to assume that role itself.  Any interruption or delay in handling complaints would have adverse regulatory consequences and Genworth could not realistically secure claims handling services from anyone other than Santander.  </p>

On the same date, the parties entered into a standstill agreement suspending the running of time in relation to the claims now made by AXA.  On 24 December 2018, the CHA was amended and restated in respects which are irrelevant for present purposes.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">To complete the picture, it is necessary also to be aware that Santander’s refusal to sign the Settlement Agreement had an impact on the acquisition of FICL/FACL by AXA.  The relevant Sale and Purchase Agreement was concluded on 1 December 2015 when the full scope of FICL/FACL’s potential liability for PPI mis-selling was still unknown.  At that stage it was anticipated that the Settlement Agreement would be signed and that Santander would ultimately take responsibility for those liabilities.  The SPA accordingly contained an express provision that 90% of such liability would be allocated to Genworth as seller but that this liability would cease on signature of the Settlement Agreement.  Notwithstanding the non-signature of the agreement, Genworth refused to pay and this led to proceedings by AXA against Genworth (“the <span style="font-weight:bold">Genworth proceedings</span>”).  Following a judgment by Mr Justice Bryan in favour of AXA on liability and quantum, AXA and Genworth entered into a confidential settlement agreement in July 2020.  In practical terms, therefore, it is Genworth rather than AXA which stands to benefit from success in this action.</p>

The outrage felt by AXA/Genworth is compounded by the fact that the Settlement Agreement under which Santander voluntarily undertook to assume the burden of making redress was simply rejected by it at the last minute when it had not only been finally agreed but had also been signed by Genworth and delivered to Santander for execution at the latter’s express request.</p>

However, it is truism that hard cases make bad law and a general feeling that AXA has been ill-used is no substitute for proper legal analysis.  The court’s task is not simply to do justice; it is to do justice according to the law, and any sympathy that I might otherwise have felt for AXA’s plight must be firmly put to one side when undertaking that task.</p>

This is that the DISP complaints regime pursuant to which AXA/Genworth have been required to pay the sums claimed in these proceedings (and which Santander itself has been required to apply in respect of post-2005 sales) involves the application of much more rigorous standards than those regarded as acceptable at the time the sales were made.  It is also heavily weighted in favour of the consumer through evidential presumptions requiring assertions made in the complaints form to be accepted in the absence of evidence to the contrary, and by requiring complaints in certain instances (for example, negative option sales or sales to the self-employed), to be mandatorily “auto-upheld” without further investigation into the facts (such as whether the customer might in fact have known about and wanted the cover).  It was submitted by Mr Zellick that if the current claim succeeds, the effect would be to hold Santander liable for sales which were properly made in accordance with the universally applied standards of the day and without proper scrutiny of the factual basis of the underlying complaint.  He argued that this would be wholly unjust and unjustified.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in"> A recurrent theme of Santander’s submissions was that responsibility for any mis-selling was to be laid – if not entirely, then at least substantially – at FICL/FACL’s door on the basis that they had an overriding responsibility for the way in which PPI was sold.  This argument was packaged in a variety of beguiling ways depending on the context in which it was deployed.  Thus, in the context of AXA’s indemnity claim, it was presented as a failure by FICL/FACL to comply with a condition precedent requiring it to have complied with their duties under the Agency Agreement or as a question of causation/authorisation.  In the context of the claim in negligence, it was said to be relevant to breach and causation.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">I put it to Mr Zellick during the course of argument that the question of responsibility might be answered differently depending on the particular relationship in which it arose.  For example, the undisputed fact that FICL/FACL bore primary responsibility for the sale of PPI vis-à-vis the regulator, did not necessarily mean that they bore primary responsibility as between themselves and GECB or the end customer.  Mr Zellick, however, was unperturbed by any such potential distinctions.  In his submission, FICL/FACL bore primary responsibility vis-à-vis the regulator, GECB and the end customers.  This is a submission which will have to be scrutinised in due course in relation to each head of claim.  Nonetheless, in whatever guise the argument was presented, it raised the following issues with which it is convenient to deal with compendiously at the outset:</p>

I therefore accept that it was not unreasonable at the time to take the view that if a customer was eligible to take out a policy, they would derive at least some benefit from it.  I also accept that sales staff were not expected to reinvent the wheel for PPI if the relevant information as to age and employment status had already been captured as part of the credit application unless they had reason to believe (whether from the disclosed information or otherwise) that a customer was, for example, approaching the upper age limit or was a student or self-employed.

Providing misleading or inaccurate information about the policy to the customer most likely would be in breach of GISC paragraph 1.3 in the same way that it would be a breach under the relevant provisions after January 2005.

As to this, it may have been Mr Blundell’s personal experience that non-compliant sales practices were not expressly or routinely referred to as “mis-selling”, <span style="font-weight:bold">although I note that both FICL/FACL and GECB were referring explicitly to “mis-</span>selling” in early 1998.  But how they were labelled is irrelevant.  Mr Blundell accepted that policies were sold to ineligible people from time to time and that is mis-selling, however it may have been described at the time.  In any event, Mr Pendleton’s evidence was that what would now be regarded as “mis-selling” tended to be handled by the credit lender as a refund and processed in bulk, rather than identified specifically as a complaint.  This may well have served to mask the problem from an insurer’s perspective.  At all events, it is clear that complaints about “mis-selling” were beginning to emerge in 1997 in sufficient numbers to be a cause for concern as evidenced by (i) the Insurance Ombudsman’s “tip of the iceberg” speech in December 1997; (ii) Mrs Greenaway’s evidence; (iii) GECB’s own internal compliance review in November 1997 (as to which see paragraphs<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>‎148-‎149 below); and (iv) the FSA’s Policy Statement of August 2010. </p>

He said that he had never been aware of a problem and that as far as he was concerned, PPI was always sold in accordance with <span style="font-style:italic">“our”</span> interpretation of the ABI Code, by which I understood him to mean the three insurance companies for whom he worked over the period.  He also said that his three employers had only experienced a very low level of complaints.  He was inclined to dismiss the Insurance Ombudsman’s speech as unnecessary scaremongering and suggested that any perceived increase in claims was due to a rapid expansion of the market.  However, I cannot accept that this was the sole explanation.  Mr Blundell accepted that he had never himself been involved in or observed an actual sale of PPI and that all his information was anecdotal and based on what he had been told by colleagues.  He further accepted that the complaints which found their way to insurers such as FICL/FACL were predominantly about the handling of claims under the policy or claims decisions rather than mis-selling.  Thus, the low level of complaints to his employers could well have been explained, at least in part, by the fact that most mis-selling complaints were processed by the credit lenders as refunds and not passed back to the insurers.  I therefore do not place any significant weight on this evidence.</p>

The documents do not show how this concern was addressed but in August that year, Mr Jones contacted Vanessa Carter (then the Marketing Manager at GECF) in relation a new client launch of which he had been informed specifically in order to discuss how the EC Directives would be communicated at or before the point of sale in PPI telephone sales.</p>

At around the same time, GECB’s status for regulatory purposes changed from that of independent broker to tied agent and Mr Jones noted in an internal email that FICL/FACL were discussing compliance in tandem with finalising the Agency Agreement.  Changes to all sales and marketing documentation were also required as a result of GECB’s name change in January 1997 (referred to contemporaneously as “Project Hook”).</p>

At a meeting on 4 October 1996, Mr Jones chased for penetration analysis data which he had previously requested.  His earlier request seems to have fallen on deaf ears, since Ms Carter had to ask again about the nature and extent of information required.  Mr Jones also suggested that GECB might like to use FICL/FACL’s <span style="font-style:italic">“wide-ranging and dynamic Training Department services”.</span>  This was left for Ms Carter to consider and advise.

On a balance of probabilities, I find that this was not prompted by any request from GECB but was part of Mr Jones’s follow-up to the ABI Statement of Practice and the change in GECB’s agency status.  Only some documentation was provided, however, and Mr Jones accordingly had to chase again on 4 February 1997.  In his letter he expressly reminded GECB that it was a requirement of its agency agreement and its status as a FICL/FACL agent that all marketing material which mentioned insurance was submitted to FICL/FACL for approval.  He also emphasised that, irrespective of Project Hook, <span style="font-style:italic">“it is necessary to see drafts of marketing material before launch of a new scheme or when an existing scheme is changed.”</span></p>

Mr Jones’s handwritten annotation to the agenda records that no minutes were taken as this was <span style="font-style:italic">“very much a training-type session”.</span>  However, the documents attached to the agenda contain notes in his handwriting which refer to the meeting and show that some discussion of training took place.  They also contain two template checklists, one for creditor schemes and one for non-creditor schemes.  Both checklists contained boxes for confirmation that documentation had been checked and agreed, but while the non-creditor checklist contained entries relating to client training, the former (which would have applied to GECB) did not.  Mr Jones was asked about the discrepancy in cross-examination but ultimately could not recall anything to assist.  In the absence of any further evidence as to what information these documents were intended to capture and the extent to which they were used by FICL/FACL – either for GECB business or business introduced by other parties – I am unable to derive much assistance from them.  </p>

GECB did not request any assistance or training from FICL/FACL beyond approval of the training pack.  During the course of the hearing, Mr Zellick made much of a discussion which took place about the costs of compliance and FICL/FACL’s expressed resistance to being asked by GECB for a contribution.  However, earlier and subsequent communications make clear that this related to the costs of printing and postage and had nothing to do with the provision of training as was suggested to some of the witnesses.</p>

Mr Jones’s view was that the technical content of the material was extremely light: the selling message was brief and general and staff were asked to refer to the reverse of the credit agreement (presumably the Summary).  Separate training packs were compiled for each retailer and it would be a substantial task for FICL/FACL to sign off on each of these.  However, a full explanation of the policy benefits, eligibility and exclusions was included in the Summary on the back of the credit agreement and following Project Hook, FICL/FACL had seen and approved all point of sale marketing material.</p>

The scripts were supplemented by a coaching tool which FICL/FACL would ideally have liked to see.  However, the experience of both Mr Jones and FICL/FACL’s Senior Training Manager, Maureen Lloyd, suggested there was little chance of them being allowed to do so.

Accordingly, GECB had to sign and return a guarantee that they and their sub-agents were ABI compliant.  On behalf of GECB, Mr McPhail queried the requirement for sub-agents to explain the benefits and exclusions of cover prior to completing a sale.  He said that GECB was not in a position to guarantee this and could only offer their best endeavours.  He confirmed that compliance had assumed a high profile within GE, albeit seemingly only because of problems experienced recently in the United States, and asked whether it would be sufficient for GECB to make sure that staff were regularly audited, trained and updated.</p>

This seems to have involved a customer being sent a hard copy application form which had to be returned before a sale took place.  It was therefore rather different from an in-person sale in a store.  At all events, while minimal details of the cover would be given over the telephone, the proposed script required customers to be expressly advised that further details could be found on the back of the application form and that they would have to sign a box to indicate that they wanted insurance cover.</p>

The survey further indicated that a significant proportion of customers responding did not agree (even slightly) that all their queries had been answered, that staff were entirely sure about the details of cover, that they had sufficient time to consider the benefits, or that they had information about all the different levels of cover.  14% had felt pressurised into taking it.

A “train the trainer” session was to take place on 25 July 2000 carried out by GECB’s Client Field Sales team.  This would be followed by staff training in August 2000 on the basis of materials developed by Debenhams and GECB, also delivered by the Client Field Sales team.  An Operations Manual outlining all process flows was to be drafted and included as an appendix.  There is no indication that GECB sought to involve FICL/FACL in any of these steps or to seek their advice.</p>

The notes expressly drew attention to the need to adhere to the ABI Code in the sales process and to ensure that the information and presentation was clear, accurate and not misleading, that the cover was sufficiently explained and that customers understood what they are buying.</p>

GECB acknowledged that there had been significant problems in the past with a tick box when staff were incentivised simply to tick the box on behalf the customer without their explicit consent.  In response, FICL/FACL insisted on a signature box absent a convincing argument to the contrary.  In a follow-up email circulated within GECB on 3 April 2003, Mr Farrar of GEBC stressed that a signature box was therefore required and that push-back from the retail client was not an option.  Similarly the Summary was to be included on the application form and not provided in a separate leaflet.  He said:</p>

Even the change in selling pitch introduced in early 1998 involved positively promoting the product rather than simply presenting the customer with an option and leaving it to their choice.  This may well have been in accordance with the approach adopted across the industry at the time, but that does not automatically mean that it satisfied the prevailing regulatory standards.  </p>

This was expressly recognised by the Compliance Workout and is consistent with the concerns expressed by the Insurance Ombudsman in his December 1997 speech and with the FLA’s “welcome letter” initiative in February 1998 which made clear that some customers were not being given any marketing material at all, let alone prior to conclusion of the sale.  Even in the training notes prepared by GECB after 2000, there was no explicit instruction to refer to the Summary before concluding a sale.  Most damning of all is the Action Plan proposal to change all sales script to incorporate an express reference to the Summary, from which I draw the almost inevitable inference that this had not previously been a feature of PPI sales, notwithstanding the agreement reached in February 1998 and Mr Farrar’s email of 3 April 2003.  While the Summary was in many cases printed on the reverse of a triplicate form, the customer was typically only given a copy <span style="font-style:italic">after </span>they had already agreed to take cover and although it was open to them to ask for time to read the Summary, this put all the onus on them and was in any event irrelevant unless their attention had been drawn to the existence of the Summary in the first place.</p>

Many sales were conducted by staff who did not fully understand the product and were incentivised to achieve as many sales as possible.  While GECB ensured that its marketing materials were approved by FICL/FACL, it relied heavily on the fact that those materials were handed over on completion of the transaction and that the customer could cancel during the cooling off period.  This was a very lucrative market for GECB accounting for around one-third of its net income<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="14"><p class="FootnoteText"> 88% of 39% according to the initial notes of the November 1997 compliance workout session.</p></authorialNote> and prior to 2005 it was largely content to pay lip-service to compliance and to absorb any mis-selling complaints which did emerge.  However, GECB’s comment in the September 1999 customer survey is revealing in so far as it demonstrates that the vice of inertia selling from GECB’s point of view was the detrimental impact on customer satisfaction with the store card rather than any genuine concern about compliance.  The Compliance Workout showed that there were a significant number of complaints although it is impossible to say how many, since there was no evidence on the point.  </p>

However, the latter proposition would be remarkable and I cannot accept it.

His criticisms of FICL/FACL in this regard were aimed at three principal targets: first, a general failure by FICL/FACL to provide GECB with the necessary training and direction; second, FICL/FACL’s failure to intervene or take any corrective action when they either knew or should have known exactly how the product was being sold by GECB and its sub-agents; and third, the Budget Account policies (see paragraph ‎116 above).  </p>

Moreover, FICL/FACL knew that GECB had this knowledge, not least because they repeatedly drew it to GECB’s attention (paragraphs ‎158, ‎163 and ‎164‎ above) and because the Agency Agreement included an express obligation on the part of GECB to comply with the ABI Code.  The Code was not difficult to understand and there is nothing in the evidence which either would or should have given FICL/FACL reason to suspect that <span style="font-style:italic">GECB itself</span> required any training in its requirements – as opposed to the store staff.  </p>

However, given the extent to which FICL/FACL was kept firmly at arm’s length by GECB from any involvement in the retail side of the operation, the idea that FICL/FACL could have monitored the sales process in order to identify any training needs is fanciful.  To the contrary, the 4 February 1998 memo referred to in paragraph ‎156 above shows that Mr Jones and Ms Lloyd very much wanted to obtain a copy of GECB’s coaching tools but regarded it as a forlorn hope.</p>

This can most clearly be seen in the fact that when GECB started preparing for FSMA, it automatically assumed responsibility for training without any reference to FICL/FACL. GECB never suggested that its resources were insufficient or inadequate to provide adequate training through a “train the trainer” approach and there is certainly no evidence that FICL/FACL were made aware that in fact store retail staff had to train themselves, that GECB had no idea who had been trained or how effective any training was, and that there was a general paucity of training documentation available in the retail stores.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in"> Mr Zellick sought to suggest that this placed an obligation on FICL/FACL to identify any training needs on the part of GECB in relation to the sales process.  However, for the reasons already set out, I regard that as a wholly impractical construction to put on the agreement in the context of the relationship between the parties, particularly when the products were largely designed by GECB itself on the basis of its own market research from which FICL/FACL was firmly excluded.  In my judgment, these provisions instead had in mind assistance and training relating to the PPI product itself rather than the sales process.  Thus, if a new product were to be introduced, then FICL/FACL would provide any specialised training or market research required in relation to the specific characteristics of the product.  In fact, however, all PPI products tended to be variations on a common theme, most of which had been designed and proposed by GECB itself.  Nonetheless, so far as the technical aspects of cover were concerned, FICL/FACL reviewed and approved all marketing materials to make sure that correct and accurate descriptions were given.  </p>

Given the premium split between the parties, I do not regard FICL/FACL’s obligation to exercise best endeavours as extending to the provision of services to an agent <span style="font-style:italic">gratis</span>.  In any event, had GECB ever taken advantage of the training on offer (which it does not appear to have done), it would have been charged at a preferential rate.  In fact, the discussion on 1 December 2000 about use of the allocated training days (paragraph ‎173 above) demonstrates that GECB was more interested in training for its own commercial purposes rather than in order to ensure compliance.</p>

However, they could only have concluded that assistance and training were necessary if and to the extent that they were given reason to believe that it might be.  In her evidence, Mrs Greenaway was unable to identify any specific example of training that could have been provided by FICL/FACL which would not have been obvious to GECB in any event.  The Compliance Workout also demonstrates that GECB was perfectly aware of what compliance required and the problem was not that it had been insufficiently trained itself, but that it was either unwilling or unable to take the necessary steps to ensure compliance by the retailers.  </p>

Mrs Smith’s evidence was to similar effect: the sales process was <span style="font-style:italic">“owned by GECB”</span> and FICL/FACL routinely offered training on product knowledge but this was rarely, if ever, taken up by GECB.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">I regard the premise of this submission as flawed.  The starting point is that GECB was aware from at least November 1997 following the Compliance Workout that there were serious deficiencies in its sales processes which were leading to a significant number of complaints.  However, GECB never made FICL/FACL aware of the full findings of the Compliance Workout and only a very limited and sanitised version was presented to Mr Jones in January 1998.  Moreover, from FICL/FACL’s point of view, GECB gave them to understand that it recognised the issue and was addressing it.  Whatever reservations FICL/FACL might or might not have had about the proposed revised selling message and the huge variety of potential scripts, it nonetheless took steps to secure GECB’s agreement to refer the customer expressly to the Summary before a sale was concluded which, if done, would at least have meant that the sale was compliant.</p>

Otherwise, GECB only sought assistance in relation to specific issues and the impression created is that it was keeping the question of compliance by the retailers entirely in-house.  Whether this was for reasons of confidentiality or because of resistance by the stores to the involvement of a third party matters not.  What is clear is that GECB was very definitely <span style="font-style:italic">not</span> looking to FICL/FACL to ensure regulatory compliance at the point of sale generally.  As I have found above, GECB knew for itself full well what was required and regarded the relationship with the retailers as its exclusive prerogative.</p>

No doubt FICL/FACL knew in general terms the nature of the sales process that was supposed to be followed but that is very different from knowing whether it was being followed in practice.  If GECB did not know what was going on at the point of sale in the stores and was taking no steps to monitor the position (as the Compliance Workout demonstrates), it is fanciful to suppose that FICL/FACL should have had any more extensive knowledge.  GECB was aware of the requirements of the ABI Code to FICL/FACL’s knowledge and FICL/FACL was entitled to assume in the absence of evidence to the contrary that GECB was taking all reasonable steps to ensure compliance.</p>

I have accepted that a salesperson was not expected to sit down and start discussing policy exclusions, pre-existing medical conditions, financial circumstances or different levels of cover in detail.  But in those circumstances, the experts agreed that an express reference to the Summary was essential and this could readily be done even in the context of a short timescale for selling.</p>

However, it seems to me that this misses the point.  The essential requirement, as FICL/FACL made clear, was to ensure that a proper explanation of the product was given to the customer before the sale was concluded.  How long that would have taken is irrelevant.  It would have differed from customer to customer and in any event, as already noted, FICL/FACL did take steps to secure GECB’s agreement that the Summary would be expressly mentioned before sale.</p>

They approved all the marketing materials but GECB controlled all the customer data and only reported to FICL/FACL in bulk so that there was no way in which FICL/FACL could have identified potential mis-selling problems through an analysis of customer data.  The bulk reports submitted by GECB did not even identify the number of new policies sold by particular retailers each month.  There is no way in which FICL/FACL could have audited sales by way of “mystery shopping” on any scale which would have been meaningful, let alone representative.</p>

Nor am I persuaded that there was anything more they could reasonably have done to ensure that proper procedures were being followed by GECB.  As between FICL/FACL and GECB, the latter controlled the selling environment and FICL/FACL were effectively excluded from the relationship between GECB and the retailers.  The retail agreements between GECB and the stores were kept confidential and Mrs Greenaway confirmed that FICL/FACL would not have known whether incentives were being offered to customers or staff.  Nor were they routinely permitted access to the telecentre in Leeds.  This may have been for legitimate reasons of confidentiality but the fact remains that FICL/FACL were only allowed in on one or two occasions.</p>

True it was that FICL/FACL were the insurance experts, whereas GECB was a credit lender.  But GECB was hardly an unsophisticated ingenue.  On the contrary, it was well aware of the requirements of the ABI Code and its obligation to comply with them and in my judgment FICL/FACL were entitled to assume that GECB would act responsibly in that regard and would ask if it wanted or needed input or assistance.   When such requests were made, FICL/FACL provided assistance promptly and readily.  In these circumstances, I am not persuaded that FICL/FACL could realistically have done more than they did.  No witness could point to any occasion when they became aware of a compliance failure but were indifferent or did nothing about it.</p>

Clauses 6.1(a) and (g) and 6.2 (a) and (c) of the Agency Agreement achieved this by placing a primary obligation on GECB to comply with the ABI Code, including an explicit requirement not to incur any liability on FICL/FACL’s behalf otherwise than by selling PPI in accordance with the agreement.</p>

It is noteworthy that when GECB was asked by FICL/FACL in December 1998 to provide a guarantee of regulatory compliance on behalf of its sub-agents, it objected on the ground that it could only exercise best endeavours in that regard.  If GECB, with its much closer relationship with the retailers, could not guarantee compliance, FICL/FACL was hardly in a position to do more;</p>

Mr Jones’ evidence in his witness statement was to similar effect, namely that GECB normally only showed any interest in compliance when there was a statute or an EC Directive that needed to be observed.  Protestations by Santander that GECB would have complied with any directives or instructions issued by FICL/FACL accordingly ring rather hollow.</p>

However, it is Santander which is alleging that any non-compliance was caused by failures on the part of FICL/FACL and accordingly Santander bears at least an evidential burden in this respect, as he accepted.  If Santander is unable to identify anything specific which it says that FICL/FACL should have done but failed to do, it is equally impossible for Santander to say how that failure would have changed anything in practice.  I am not prepared on the basis of the material before me to draw the inference that some form of unidentified and unspecific training or instruction should have been given which would - in some equally unidentified manner - have prevented the compliance failures which occurred.</p>

Clause 7.1(d) was clearly aimed at the regulatory aspects of matters such as licensing, solvency and authorisation to conduct business, while clause 7.1(f) was addressing ethical business practices rather than product design.  The same is true of clause 5 since I agree with AXA that the objective of the ABI Code was clearly to regulate the <span style="font-style:italic">sale</span> of insurance products rather than the design of the products being sold.</p>

This is a high hurdle to meet, and while there was an allegation to this effect in Santander’s written opening it did not feature in Mr Zellick’s oral submissions or written closing.  I would in any event have rejected the suggestion.  Budget Accounts were in fact finance products designed originally by GECB’s predecessor for customers on limited budgets who typically maintained lower balances on their accounts.  The customer would select a maximum monthly repayment level and the credit limit was then pegged by reference to that amount.  While cover under the associated PPI product was limited to the chosen monthly repayment rather than the full outstanding balance, the premium tended also to be commensurately lower because of the generally lower outstanding balances on the account.  </p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">Several points can be made about this.  First, and perhaps most importantly, the PPI product associated with a Budget Account was a standard policy.  The only difference from other types of account lay in the pricing and the credit limit, neither of which were anything to do with FICL/FACL.  Secondly, the FOS seems in April 2015 to have regarded the real vice of the policies as being that they had been sold without adequate explanation of their coverage so that customers did not understand the full implications of having a Budget Account.  This is more a concern about the overall package and/or the sales process, rather than the inherent design of the policy itself.  Thirdly, there was a concern that the policy was unnecessary where the customer had alternative means.  However, this begs the question as to whether that was necessarily the case.  Fourthly, the very type of customer at which the Budget Account was targeted was those who were likely to spend less, in which case the FOS appears to have accepted that they received some value – at least where they did not have alternative means.</p>

Both were hearsay and there was no proper opportunity of interrogating the allegation or establishing why the FOS had apparently hardened its view by November – if indeed it had, which in the absence of evidence cannot be regarded as certain.  Without much harder evidence, I would find it difficult to conclude that the insurance product associated with Budget Accounts was so deeply flawed that it was positively unethical to sell it in any circumstances whatsoever.  If the vice was that the cost/benefit relationship was not properly explained, that is something for which GECB itself was responsible.</p>

Genworth felt that it had been given the runaround for a very long time talking to different teams, none of which seemed to know what other teams within Santander were saying or doing.  It is clear from the evidence of Mr Pateman and Mr Hazell that Santander operated in a very rigid manner where there was little co-operation or co-ordination between departments.  Each division had its own reporting lines and procedures and other departments did not get involved unless asked.  This was particularly the case with PPI remediation which appears to have been completely ring-fenced.  Little wonder, then, that Mr Rember had become frustrated at his inability to get a consistent or coherent response from Santander and was anxious to ensure that any agreed solution would “stick”.  This obviously required the involvement of senior people who could commit Santander to what was agreed.</p>

An equally powerful point on the other side is that “without prejudice” and “subject to contract” are paradigmatic ways of indicating that no agreement has been reached until reduced to writing: see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">Whitehead Mann Ltd v Cheverny Consulting Ltd, </span>[2006] EWCA Civ. 1303 at [42].  Yet, none of the experienced lawyers on Santander’s side thereafter used the expression in their correspondence.  Nonetheless, as <span style="font-style:italic">Whitehead </span>makes clear, it is not essential to have an express stipulation and, in my judgment, the objective observer would have expected a regulated banking entity the size of Santander to have internal governance procedures and, at the very least, only to commit to a permanent solution of a long-standing and contentious issue in writing.  It would be unusual and surprising to find it entering into a multi-million pound settlement orally on the basis of a meeting lasting less than an hour.</p>

Mr Pateman was sufficiently senior in the organisation to make the agreement.  He had been briefed in the context of Genworth’s express demand that key decision-makers would be present and I find that he and Mr Lloyd had authority to bind both SCL and SISUK.<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="16"><p class="FootnoteText"> No distinction was ever drawn between the companies and they were certainly held out as having authority to act on behalf of both.  </p></authorialNote>  Moreover, none of the Santander witnesses was able to point to any formal policy requiring ExCo approval or indeed any other procedure for entering into agreements.  I accept AXA’s submission that if this had in fact been the case, something would have been said either at the meeting itself or during the subsequent negotiations on the outstanding matters.  If there were any doubt about this, Ms Day only confirmed the accuracy of Mr Rember’s 5 June 2015 email after obtaining the <span style="font-style:italic">“relevant inputs”</span> which in itself implies the existence of due authority to make the agreement.</p>

All the witnesses agreed that the meeting was shorter than anticipated (estimates varied from 20-40 minutes) because Mr Pateman had to leave for his pre-arranged meeting with the FOS on another matter.  This, combined with the express consensus that the agreement would need to be recorded, militates against an objective intention to reach a binding agreement there and then.</p>

However, I do not regard this as a particularly weighty point given that the previous agreements in 2012 and 2013 were never understood to be a definitive solution for all time.  On the contrary, they were clearly only interim agreements intended to hold the ring pending the introduction of the new claims handling process.</p>

However, others were more substantive.  For example, the respective obligations of the parties under any claims handling agreement, and the nature of any future operational costs which might be incurred by Genworth.  Although it was expected that the latter would largely be eliminated by the new claims handling arrangements, this was by no means settled and it was also possible that the new arrangements might affect the extent of FOS fees to be incurred.  Furthermore, what would have been the position if the FOS had not agreed to deal directly with Santander, so that costs were not reduced as anticipated?  As it happens, the FOS did agree to this in principle at its meeting with Mr Pateman later on the same day, but this could not have been known at the time.  I also doubt that Santander would have been quite so sanguine about concluding an agreement unless satisfactory assurances were given with regard to NewDay and this was almost certainly an important factor in Mr Pateman’s willingness to reach agreement.  </p>

In any event, it would have been the height of imprudence not to make appropriate financial provision immediately if it was expected that the agreement would in due course be signed.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">In fact, the first suggestion that a binding agreement had been reached on 4 June 2015 was only made some years later in December 2020.  The reason given for this by AXA was that it was pointless to mention it earlier because Santander had long since reneged on the agreement and AXA had no choice but to agree to its demands.  I find this unconvincing.  The most likely explanation to my mind is that the argument was subsequently forged in a legal crucible as an ingenious afterthought.  I hasten to add that there is nothing improper in this.  It is for the court to decide whether or not a binding agreement was concluded, irrespective of what the parties may or may not have thought.  Litigants are entitled to present the facts in whatever legal guise seems best to them.  If a particular argument only comes late to the party, that may be something which goes to its weight, but it is not objectionable to put it forward.  In my judgment, however, the complete absence of any previous assertion that binding agreement had been reached in June 2015 seriously undermines any suggestion that this was in fact Genworth’s subjective understanding at the time.</p>

I was, nonetheless, invited by Mr Green to draw adverse inferences from Santander’s failure to call Ms Day to give evidence.  The drawing of adverse inferences from the absence of a witness is largely a matter of common sense depending on the particular context and circumstances, including: (a) whether the witness is available; (b) whether it is reasonable to expect that they have relevant evidence to give; (c) what other evidence is available on those points; and (d) the significance of the points in the context of the case: <span style="font-style:italic">Efobi v Royal Mail Group Ltd, </span>[2021] UKSC 33; [2021] 1 WLR 3863 at [41].</p>

None of Messrs Lloyd, Hazell or Pateman could really recall exactly what was said, whereas Ms Day had been much more closely involved both beforehand and afterwards and could reasonably have been expected to have a more detailed and accurate recollection.  No explanation was offered as to why she had not been called and there was no suggestion that she was either unwilling or unavailable to attend.  I understand that she has now retired, but so have Mr Lloyd and Mr Conway, both of whom were proffered as witnesses.  My hunch is that she was hugely embarrassed by Santander’s subsequent withdrawal from the agreement and possibly reluctant to give evidence for that reason, but that does not mean that I can infer she would have supported AXA’s case on whether a binding agreement was reached – certainly where I have found that Mr Rember himself did not have that understanding.</p>

It did not necessarily have to go back to ExCo and if it had been signed in October 2015 it would have been fully binding.  It was sheer bad luck from AXA’s point of view that Mr Pateman left when he did and that his replacement decided that a review was necessary.  It can well be said that this was opportunistic on Santander’s part.  I cannot accept that the ostensible reason given for the refusal to sign, namely concerns about the allegedly flawed design of the Budget Accounts (for which GECB itself was responsible) was genuine.  Nonetheless, for as long as the agreement remained unsigned, Santander was at liberty to withdraw for good reason, bad reason or no reason at all and this no doubt presented itself as a convenient peg on which to hang its change of heart.</p>

In any event, Ms Day would clearly not have had authority on her own to commit Santander to an agreement of this nature if it had not already been concluded and no-one could reasonably have supposed that she did.</p>

They were all treated the same no matter when they were sold.  Nonetheless, Santander argues that for the purposes of the indemnity provisions in clause 12, a distinction between them falls to be made even though it could not point to any other clause of the agreement where such a distinction was drawn.  AXA points out that, if correct, this would mean that from 1 December 2000 Santander continued to receive around 95% of any premium paid (after payment of claims) in respect of pre-agreement policies but was not to be liable for any mis-selling of the policies even if due to its own acts or omissions.  Mr Green submits that such a startling asymmetry of risk and reward would require a very clear intention, particularly where one of the principal purposes of PPI in the first place was to protect Santander’s own credit risk.</p>

He further submitted that the agreement could have referred to “ongoing marketing and sale” or to “marketing and sale of New Policies” if it had been intended to exclude the marketing and sale of Existing Policies.  Santander’s riposte was that could equally have said “including Existing Policies”.  It is not uncommon for both sides to deploy arguments to the effect that the rival construction could have been expressly spelled out if it had been intended.  Such arguments take the matter no further, particularly where the likelihood is that no-one addressed their minds to this particular point.  The court’s task is to discern the parties’ objective intention from what they have actually said, not from what they could or might have said, which can only ever be speculative.</p>

There was therefore no way of identifying New Policies for the purposes of treating them differently unless GECB were to adopt a whole new reporting system and there is no evidence that the parties envisaged any such change.         </p>

Further, I can see no logical or commercial reason why the parties would have intended GECB to be liable for the consequences of its acts and omissions in relation to New Policies but not Existing Policies, particularly when the Agency Agreement was concluded at a time when (to the knowledge of both parties) the impending FSMA regime did not distinguish between future and historic sales.</p>

It is also true that all but one of the draft agreements before the court contained a materially identical clause.

He also attempted to derive support from GECB’s refusal to give an indemnity in relation to the Account Cover issue (see paragraph ‎167 above).  However, that involved refusal of a specific indemnity in the context of a specific problem, and in any event it is incontrovertible that the Agency Agreement <span style="font-style:italic">did</span> contemplate mutual indemnities, whatever GE’s “normal” policy might have been.</p>

In this way the indemnity was tied to GECB’s activities as agent in respect of the schemes covered by the agreement.  The restriction thus relates to the scope of the agency rather than being temporal.  Any other conclusion would lead to a situation where there was potentially no indemnity for the mis-selling of Existing Policies sold prior to the Effective Date, but acts and omissions after that date could incur liabilities.  That would be contrary to what I find to have been the objective intention of the parties to draw no distinction between any of the policies for any purpose.

However, the submission is factually flawed.  Mrs Greenaway’s evidence confirmed that the only schemes which were regarded as “discontinued” for the purposes of the Agency Agreement were those under which no policies had ever been sold.  Schemes under which policies had been sold which could still be reactivated or give rise to claims despite being dormant for years were not treated as “discontinued” but were regarded as existing schemes covered by the Agency Agreement.  Thus Appendix 4 to the agreement included several schemes under which no premium had been collected since 1995 and under which no new policies could have been sold after the Effective Date.  This also provides some support for the view that the Agency Agreement must have been intended to apply to historic marketing and sale under those schemes.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">As to (a), the meaning of “liability” is a question of construction which depends on the particular facts of the case.  Mr Zellick relied on certain comments of the Court of Appeal in <span style="font-style:italic">Smit Tak Offshore Services Ltd v Youell,</span> [1992] 1 Lloyd’s Rep. 154, 159 but those were concerned with a very different situation, namely whether a letter from the Dubai Department of Ports and Customs instructing the claimant to remove a wreck on pain of non-renewal of a licence to operate in Dubai waters created a liability for the purposes of a liability insurance policy.  Unsurprisingly, the court held that it did not, although Mustill LJ stated that if the letter had been cast in the form of an instruction from the Ruler of Dubai himself – he being the source of all law – the result would have been different as the letter would then have created a legal obligation to raise the wreck.  </p>

That again was an entirely different situation as no-one in this case suggests that FICL/FACL did not have valid obligations of some description to pay these sums.  The question is “to whom”?  Indeed at paragraph 87 of that case, Lewison LJ expressly accepted that “liability” does not necessarily imply enforceability, although it did in the particular context before him.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">Thus, neither of these authorities unequivocally supports Santander’s construction that the liability must be directly enforceable by the third party and I decline so to hold.  It seems to me that the word is apt to include any liability or binding obligation which could have been enforced against FICL/FACL irrespective of by whom or on what basis, be it tort, contract, breach of statutory duty or a purely regulatory liability.  In the context of an agency agreement between parties specifically relating to regulated activities, I can see no reason to exclude regulatory liabilities even if they could not necessarily have been enforced directly by the consumer against FICL/FACL in a civil action.  I do, however, accept that the liability must be one which is imposed on FICL/FACL rather than one which only exists as a result of having been voluntarily assumed.  </p>

They were also rules, rather than guidance, contravention of which could be sanctioned by enforcement action.  In a Policy Statement dated August 2010, the FSA expressed the clear view that breaches of the FSA Principles gave rise to liabilities and that the complaints handling rules accordingly <span style="font-style:italic">required</span> a firm to uphold a complaint and pay appropriate redress when the conduct in question was in breach of the Principles.  </p>

Admittedly they could recover damages for that breach but it would not have been a claim for redress as such.</p>

On the contrary, they were under a binding regulatory obligation, which had statutory force, to pay such redress as was appropriate under the relevant rules.  The sausage which came out of the regulatory machine was accordingly a liability to pay redress and if FICL/FACL had failed to do so, not only could the regulator have taken enforcement action against them, but the customer had a civil route by which it could secure payment, even if only indirectly by way of damages.</p>

Under FSMA, FOS awards could be enforced as if they were orders of the court and, if accepted by the complainant, gave rise to a <span style="font-style:italic">res judicata</span> precluding further proceedings.  Santander nonetheless submitted that, with one exception, none of the complaints referred to the FOS resulted in a binding award because FICL/FACL chose to pay on the basis of a provisional decision rather than a final award.   Accordingly, even on the basis of the analysis above, there was no liability on the part of FICL/FACL to make payment.  In my judgment, this is a distinction without a difference.  The decision of the FOS may have been provisional, but it was still a decision which stood unless and until challenged by either party.  I am therefore satisfied that payment pursuant to such a decision was also a liability for the purposes of the indemnity.</p>

Indeed, it could be said that the whole point of an indemnity is to provide protection against consequences which are unforeseeable as pointed out by Simon Birt KC in <span style="font-style:italic">Rhine Shipping DMCC v Vitol SA,</span> [2023] EWHC 1265 (Comm) at [219].  The situation is very different from that in <span style="font-style:italic">BCCI v Ali (No. 1),</span> [2001] UKHL 8; [2002] 1 AC 251, where the court was concerned with a release of claims in a settlement agreement.

On that basis there can be no doubt that the redress payments and FOS fees are liabilities which were proximately and effectively caused by the mis-selling.  In any event, in the context of the relationship between the parties, they were also precisely the types of regulatory consequence which would have been in contemplation at the date of the Agency Agreement, even if the precise regulatory machinery could not itself have been foreseen.</p>

However, in my judgment this is not a liability which falls within the ambit of clause 12.2.  Genworth was under no obligation to anybody to set up a separate call centre to handle claims; its decision to do so was entirely voluntary and made (no doubt for very good reason) for its own commercial convenience.  As such, these costs do not in my judgment constitute a liability covered by clause 12.2.</p>

In this case, there may or may not have been such a liability and I fail to see how the mere entering into of a voluntary settlement of claims which are feared, but which have never been advanced, can have created one.  Put a different way, a settlement concluded specifically in order to avoid a regulatory liability can hardly be said to establish that liability.  At best, the settlement could be said to represent costs incurred to avoid a liability, but in the absence of some doctrine akin to that of sue and labour in marine insurance, such costs are not recoverable under an indemnity: see <span style="font-style:italic">Yorkshire Water Services Ltd v Sun Alliance &amp; London Insurance plc, </span>[1997] 2 Lloyd’s Rep. 21.  I would in any event have held that any liability under the settlement agreement was not proximately caused by the alleged mis-selling.</p>

In truth, none of these cases provided unequivocal support for either proposition but, since I have not found it necessary to resort to the burden of proof, I will not lengthen this judgment further by addressing the point in detail.

For the reasons already given, I am satisfied that FICL/FACL’s liability for redress payments and FOS fees arose by reason of GECB’s mis-selling and are therefore covered by the indemnity.  By contrast, the administrative costs and sums paid under the OR settlement cannot, even if they can properly be regarded as “liabilities” for this purpose.  For the avoidance of doubt, the basis of my decision on this head of claim is that GECB is liable for all the regulatory consequences of its mis-selling and is therefore liable for all redress and FOS fees paid by AXA under the regulatory regime, irrespective of whether individual complaints would have succeeded in a court of law.</p>

The indemnity is expressly not limited to negligence or breach of contract but is triggered by any act or omission, culpable or otherwise.  More broadly, however, Santander’s submission was that FICL/FACL cannot have incurred any liability for GECB’s acts committed outside the permitted scope of the agency so that it must be assumed that the conduct in question was within the scope of the agency and had thus been authorised.  In so far as this was intended to suggest that GECB’s conduct was expressly authorised, that would be tantamount to an allegation of deliberate misconduct.  However, the case is not pleaded in that way and I have in any event accepted that FICL/FACL were aware only of the general process by which PPI was sold and not that systemic mis-selling was taking place.  In my judgment, it would make a nonsense of the indemnity to hold that it did not apply to the carrying out of authorised activities (the sale of PPI) in an unauthorised manner (by mis-selling). </p>

That was a shipping case where there was an express indemnity against <span style="font-style:italic">“all consequences or liabilities arising from the Master … signing Bills of Lading or other documents or other complying with [the Charterers’] orders.”  </span>McNair J held that the obligation to indemnify against <span style="font-style:italic">“all liabilities”</span> was to provide indemnity against the incurring of the liability, not its discharge.  He did not expressly consider the indemnity against <span style="font-style:italic">“all consequences”</span>.

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">Had clause 1.1 stood alone, it would have had the effect that SISUK not only undertook to perform all of SCL’s obligations under the Agency Agreement from 1 January 2010 but also agreed to assume any liability of SCL in respect of the agreement, irrespective of when or how that liability arose.  However, clause 1.1 was qualified and limited by the provisions of clauses 1.2 and 1.3 which provided that SISUK and Genworth should have no liability to each other in respect of duties, obligations, causes of action, claims or liabilities arising before 1 January 2010, while SCL and Genworth should have no liability to each other in respect of such matters arising after that date.  For this purpose, it seems tolerably clear that the word <span style="font-style:italic">“liabilities”</span> does not refer to the liability incurred by FICL/FACL in respect of which indemnity is sought, but rather to GECB’s liability to indemnify.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in">As I have found above, AXA’s cause of action for an indemnity against GECB accrued when it was called upon to pay.  Since it is common ground that this was within six years of the standstill agreement, it must necessarily have been after 1 January 2010 and liability was accordingly novated to SISUK.  This would also be consistent with the provision in clause 1.4 for rights accrued before 1 January 2010 to remain where they were.  The fact that any mis-selling arose because of GECB’s breaches of duty prior to 2010 is irrelevant.  The mis-selling had already long-since occurred and there would no longer have been any question of calling upon GECB to perform its duties in that respect at the date of the novation. </p>

However, Santander argues that this is not a liability that could have been enforced as such in the civil courts by the complainants.  The only claim that could be brought would be for default in the handling of the complaint whereas none of the claims by consumers was made on this basis.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">While I rejected this argument in the context of the indemnity claim, I have concluded that in this context, it is correct.  Section 1(6) contemplates that the action brought by the person who suffered the damage must be one which has established or is capable of establishing the liability.  However, the only civil claims that could have been asserted by consumers would have been for breach of rules 1.4.1 or 1.4.4 of DISP (set out at paragraphs ‎288 above) and, far from being in breach these rules, AXA/Genworth appear to have observed them meticulously.  Likewise, it may be that AXA/Genworth were under a regulatory liability to pay redress or satisfy FOS awards, but that was because of an obligation owed to the regulator, not because they were under any liability to the consumer which the consumer could enforce directly.  Moreover, the obligation under rule 1.4.1 is to pay redress when the insurer decides it is appropriate to do so.  It is difficult to see how an action for breach of 1.4.1 can prescribe positively how that discretion should have been exercised.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">The same difficulty arises in relation to the obligation under rule 1.4.4 to satisfy FOS awards.  While paragraph 16 of Schedule 17 to FSMA entitles the customer to enforce a FOS award as if it were payable under a county court judgment, this presupposes that liability has already been established by the award.  Neither a claim for breach of rule 1.4.4 nor enforcement under paragraph 16 is itself capable of establishing any liability.</p>

AXA also complains that this means it is worse off as regards a contribution claim for having complied with its regulatory obligations than it would have been if it had ignored or disobeyed them.  However, this is a statutory remedy and the statutory requirements must be observed.  Where those requirements are clear, as they are, it is not for the courts to correct any perceived illogicality or injustice in their operation.</p>

However, AXA’s case was not pleaded or argued on that basis.  The only liability asserted was a regulatory liability and in my judgment a claim for contribution on that basis cannot succeed.</p>

First, for the reason given in paragraph ‎294 above, namely that a provisional decision is more than merely advisory; and secondly, because I do not see why payment pursuant to a provisional decision would not have amounted to a <span style="font-style:italic">bona fide</span> settlement or compromise of a claim within section 1(4) of the Act.  I agree with AXA that it would be perverse to adopt a construction of the Act which required the customer to pursue a complaint to the bitter end.</p>

As discussed at paragraphs ‎302-‎304 above, the settlement did not compromise any claims because no claims had been made.  It was essentially a payment made to forestall any such claims and it cannot be said that AXA was under any liability to the bankrupt estates save in so far as created by the settlement agreement itself.  </p>

I am unable to accept this submission.  GECB had no direct nexus with the customers and certainly no contractual link.  I am not persuaded that it was in a sufficiently proximate relationship with customers to say that it voluntarily assumed responsibility to them for the sale of the policy – at least in the absence of circumstances taking a particular case out of the norm.  In these circumstances, it would not be fair, just or reasonable to impose a direct duty on GECB which ultimately only had a relationship with the customers in relation to PPI as agent for FICL/FACL and not in its own right.  It is further arguable that the imposition of a generalised direct duty in this situation would cut across the contractual allocation of responsibilities as between FICL/FACL and GECB and as between GECB and the retail stores.</p>

GECB was not acting as an independent broker but as a tied agent of FICL/FACL.  It was therefore very firmly on the insurer’s side of the fence and I can see no justification whatsoever for any “incremental” extension of a duty of care to this situation.  The fact that as between GECB and FICL/FACL, GECB was the principal economic beneficiary of the policies sold was irrelevant so far as the customer was concerned.</p>

However, in the context of a claim under the 1978 Act, it is not sufficient, as it is in the context of the indemnity claim, merely to point to systemic failures as having been the effective cause of the entirety of the redress payments.  There is an express statutory requirement that GECB be liable for the same damage <span style="font-style:italic">“suffered by another person”</span> as AXA.  AXA therefore needs to be able to identify actual damage suffered by a particular customer which necessarily requires analysis of each individual case to see whether it discloses a breach of duty and, if so, the extent of any damage caused as a result.  This is in contrast to the claim for an indemnity or in negligence where the focus is on the loss or damage caused to AXA, where I accept that the loss can be looked at globally.  </p>

That would obviously depend on the evidence in specific cases, for example where a customer was wrongly told that taking out PPI was required in order to be approved for credit.  Considerations of this nature will be addressed in relation to the Sample Complaints but I am not asked in these proceedings to look at individual cases any more widely than that.  Rather AXA argued that, by inviting a customer to buy PPI, GECB was necessarily impliedly representing in every case that the policy offered at least some benefit.  In response, Mr Zellick submitted that there was no scope for an implied representation in a non-advised sale.  I am by no means persuaded by this latter argument.  Whether advised or non-advised, the test is as set out above and it is by no means impossible to envisage circumstances in which an implied representation could be made even in the context of a non-advised sale.</p>

The question of whether a misrepresentation was made, whether expressly or impliedly, is intensely fact-specific and cannot be determined on an indiscriminate global basis.  In any event, the need to show specific damage to a specific customer applies just as much here as it does to a claim based on misrepresentation as it does to an argument that GECB was liable for straightforward negligence.</p>

A broad and holistic assessment is required and there is no restriction on what can be taken into account provided the court thinks it relevant.  AXA submits that the court should therefore have regard to the fact that customers considering the purchase of PPI (assuming they were aware of it at all) were likely to be concerned about their ability to repay and thus financially vulnerable and unsophisticated.  It was a not a situation where they had voluntarily sought the opportunity to purchase PPI and in circumstances where they were first being offered an unsolicited store card and then PPI on top, there was a risk of them being bounced into a series of financial decisions at speed without having had a proper opportunity to think them through.  Also relevant was the fact that GECB had a substantial interest in maximising sales which was not disclosed and that the retail staff were also often incentivised to achieve sales.</p>

The objective of section 1(6) is not to create or deem a liability where none can exist, but to recognise that it need not be formally established.  In this case, there was a whole range of possible remedies under section 140B, some of which did not involve payment at all (for example, altering the terms of the agreement).  In those circumstances, repayment might never have been ordered and it is therefore difficult to see how GECB would be said to have been liable to make such repayment.</p>

All that can be said is that, given the limited circumstances in which a claim would be likely to arise at all (i.e., where there was a specific assumption of responsibility or a specific misrepresentation), it is difficult to envisage circumstances where the apportionment would not be very heavily, if not entirely, against Santander.  Likewise if Santander were held to have been in general breach of duty or to have made a generalised misrepresentation.  In this context, it is not totally without significance that Santander shouldered the entire burden of making redress payments until 2015.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">Three potential limitation points arose in relation to the contribution claim but only one of them was the subject of any debate.  This arose from the fact that section 140A of the Consumer Credit Act does not apply to “completed agreements”.  Under the Act, a “completed agreement” is one under which sum is or may become payable.  AXA thus accepted that credit agreements which had been cancelled prior to 6 April 2008 (when the relevant provisions came into force) were “completed” for this purpose.  However, it argued that the exclusion did not apply to dormant accounts which could be resurrected at any time.  It further argued that the exclusion does not bite simply because the associated PPI policy had come to an end, so long as the relevant credit agreement was still in force.</p>

So long as it is possible for a store card to be used, the credit agreement cannot be regarded as completed.  Moreover, as AXA pointed out, unfairness in relation to the policy would still have tainted the credit agreement notwithstanding the subsequent expiry of the policy, and the historic premiums might still have fallen to be repaid.</p>

That was not this case, since the only time bar was under the Limitation Act which is only procedural and bars the remedy not the right, and Santander did not argue to the contrary.  It was also common ground that as between AXA and Santander, a two-year time bar applies to any contribution claim such that AXA would have been limited in any event to recovery in respect of payments made on or after 7 December 2015, i.e., two years prior to the standstill agreement.</p>

Frequently, of course, compliance would be covered by an express provision in any agency agreement, as was the case here after 1 December 2000.  However, drafts of an agency agreement were under discussion from at least 1996 onwards which included comparable provisions.  In these circumstances, it is pure sophistry to argue that GECB was not at all times aware that it was required itself to comply with ABI Code in its capacity as FICL/FACL’s agent.</p>

            <p class="Paragraph" style="margin-left:0.35in;text-indent:0.02in">Mr Zellick’s main point under this head, however, was rather different.  He submitted that it was not foreseeable prior to 2010 that a statutory regime might subsequently be put in place which would require redress to be paid for historic sales by reference to modern standards of acceptable selling and what is fair and reasonable, without regard to the rules of evidence and whether or not there was in fact any liability.

It is therefore unsurprising that it chose to adopt a broad and flexible approach to evidential requirements.

The House of Lords held that the Law Society did not suffer damage as a result of the negligent certification until it was called upon to pay.  The mere possibility of becoming obliged to pay money in the future was not damage.  In reaching this decision the House approved the Australian decision in <span style="font-style:italic">Wardley Australia Ltd v State of Western Australia</span> (1992), 175 CLR 514 in which the High Court of Australia held that entry into a contract exposing the claimant to contingent loss or liability does not cause actual loss until the contingency is fulfilled and the loss crystallises.</p>

Similarly, where a solicitor negligently drafts a lease with the result that the client acquires a flawed asset.  In both types of case, it can fairly be said that the asset is damaged from the outset and that the claimant suffers an actual immediate loss to that extent.  This is to be contrasted with cases such as <span style="font-style:italic">Nykredit Mortgage Bank plc v Edward Erdmann Group Ltd, </span>[1997] 1 WLR 1627 where there was a negligent valuation of property.  The asset itself was not damaged but the negligent valuation meant that a lender who relied on it in entering into a mortgage might find that its security became insufficient as the market fluctuated.  The House of Lords held that the lender only suffered loss when the value of the security in fact fell below the amount of the loan.  The security rights themselves were not flawed; it was simply a question of their adequacy at a particular point in time.</p>

Mr Zellick argued rather faintly that a contingent liability to pay compensation impaired the value of FICL/FACL’s overall book of business in the sense that FICL/FACL’s rights under the policies were encumbered by the risk of having to pay compensation.  However, by parity of reasoning with <span style="font-style:italic">Sephton</span>, this was a purely contingent liability, which was incapable of quantification unless and until a complaint was made and liability actually incurred.

For this purpose, they have invited me to give them as much guidance as is feasibly possible by (a) considering certain specific files in detail and (b) determining some fifty “Points of Principle” in the hope that this will assist them in their endeavours.</p>

              <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">The first and most important point to make is that this exercise has no relevance to AXA’s indemnity claim, which is the principal basis on which I have found that the claim succeeds.  As I have held, Santander is liable for all the regulatory consequences of GECB’s mis-selling.  Accordingly, to the extent that AXA/Genworth were required to pay redress in accordance with the regulatory regime, the loss is covered by the indemnity even if a particular complaint might not have succeeded in court.  By contrast, the claim in negligence does require assessment of individual cases (as would the contribution claim had it succeeded).  The relevance of what follows is therefore limited to that basis of claim..  </p>

That is sufficient to discharge the evidential burden resting on AXA which it is then for Santander to rebut.  In the absence of Santander adducing positive evidence to the contrary, however, assertions falling within the sub-paragraphs of paragraph ‎6 above may be taken to be proved unless they are obviously incoherent, or internally inconsistent or inherently implausible for some other reason.

The nature of the PPIQ is such that all customers are likely to have been asked the same questions and if they gave answers to the same effect it is unsurprising that the company couched it in the same terms.  Given the many hundreds of claims which they were no doubt handling, this is unsurprising and unobjectionable.  What matters is the substance of what was said.</p>

              <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.5in;text-indent:0.12in">Likewise, I pay little regard to the lack of any signature or statement of truth in the PPIQ itself.  In every case that I have looked at which involved a claims management company, there was a signed letter of authority from the customer, authorising the company to act on their behalf.  A large number of these letters included express agreement  to the company’s terms and conditions.  Where those terms and conditions were in the papers before me,<authorialNote class="footnote" marker="20"><p class="FootnoteText"> As they were for claims submitted by The Claims Guys, YourMoneyClaim and Reclaim PPI.</p></authorialNote> they invariably contained an undertaking by the customer as to the truthfulness and accuracy of the information provided.  I would be frankly astonished if some such condition was not included in every claims handling contract and I am prepared to infer that it was.  This could indeed explain why in many cases the PPIQ was completed by the claims management company and not separately signed by the customer.  Either way, there would be sufficient assurance of truth and accuracy to justify accepting the complaint as evidence which would also extend to statements made by the claims management company as agent on the basis of information supplied to it.</p>

The fact that a complaint may have been auto-upheld is therefore irrelevant, as is the fact that there may have been other grounds for upholding it which were not taken into account.

Although the parties may have their own reasons for doing so, I do not at present understand why it should be necessary to distinguish between the different reasons why customers might have wanted or needed to be given this information in order to decide whether to take cover or not.  Likewise, I can see no obvious reason in principle to treat Budget Accounts differently from other forms of cover.  The fundamental point in all cases is that the customers needed to have sufficient information in order to understand what they were buying, but provided they did and were directed to the Summary, it could be assumed that they were capable of deciding for themselves whether to take the policy.  I have held that  there was otherwise no obligation on sales staff to discuss sensitive medical or financial information in any more detail unless they had reason to suspect that it might be relevant.  </p>

Necessarily, this will depend on looking at the circumstances of each case in the light of the particular policy wording, but the rule of thumb applied by the FOS in taking six months of sick pay or redundancy benefit seems to be a sensible and appropriate benchmark to adopt where “other means” are concerned.</p>

He submitted that the customer clearly could not recollect the sale at all.

In those circumstances, Mr Taylor is likely to be correct that the PPIQ indicates only that the customer was unsure whether they had ever had PPI.  Nonetheless, a lack of recollection is entirely consistent with nothing having been said about PPI at all which, given the date of the transaction and the fact that it would have been an opt-out sale, is entirely plausible.  Moreover, I am prepared to infer that the customer signed terms and conditions with Gladstone Brookes which warranted the accuracy of what was contained in the complaint, and that this can be taken to include Gladstone Brookes’s covering letter sent as agent for the customer.</p>

If the complainant had positively asserted that the addition of PPI and the option to cancel were not expressly drawn to their attention at any stage, that would have been sufficient for default presumption (a) to apply.  As it is, the application form did mention PPI and it is at least possible that the customer read and understood it at the time.  However, since they cannot now remember anything at all about the sale - for example whether they did or did not read the application form, or whether anything was or was not said - it is impossible even on the most benevolent reading to identify any actual complaint.  This claim accordingly fails.</p>

              <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">There are some inconsistencies in this evidence.  First, the customers have misremembered the approximate date on which the transaction took place by some years.  However, on any view it was a long time before the PPIQ was completed and I do not regard this as a serious defect.  Secondly, although there is no legible copy of the credit agreement in the papers, I was shown examples of others that were in use for the same retailer at the same time.  It is clear from this that the application form did in fact mention PPI in a box on the front page in broadly similar terms to those set out in paragraph ‎30 above.  However, instead of being told to return a cancellation slip if they did not want the policy, the customer was invited to tick a box to opt out of cover.  The box in this case was not ticked.</p>

              <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.25in">Nonetheless, the customer is clear that nothing was expressly stated about PPI during the sales process and this is consistent with what I have found to be GECB’s general practice.  The fact that the customer could not remember seeing anything about PPI on the form only serves to confirm the fact that customers typically did not read the form in any detail - whether through choice or because they were given no opportunity or time to do so.  This emphasises why it was important for the opt-out to be drawn specifically to their attention.  Default presumption (a) applies and this is therefore a No Consent case.  </p>

As Mr Campbell pointed out, under the applicable policy wording they may not have been covered if their company had stopped trading without becoming insolvent.  Default presumptions (b) and (c) apply in this respect as well.</p>
