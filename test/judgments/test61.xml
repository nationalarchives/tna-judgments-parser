              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The Defendant (“Med-El”) appealed with permission granted by myself against an order dated 21 September 2022 of Campbell Forsyth sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge revoking Med-El’s European Patent (UK) No. 3 138 605 entitled “MRI-safe disk magnet for implants” (“the Patent”) for the reasons given in the judge’s judgment dated 1 June 2022 [2022] EWHC 1345 (Pat). As its title suggests, the Patent discloses and claims a cochlear implant which comprises a magnet that makes the implant safer in MRI scanners than prior implants. There was no challenge to the claimed priority date of 23 April 2010. The judge held that the Patent was obvious in the light of Med-El’s International Patent Application No. WO 03/081976 entitled “Reducing effect of magnetic and electromagnetic fields on an implant’s magnet and/or electronics” (“Zimmerling”); but that, if the Patent had been valid, the Claimants (“Advanced Bionics”) would have infringed it by dealings in their HiRes Ultra 3D cochlear implant device. Advanced Bionics contended by a respondents’ notice that, if the Patent was valid, they had not infringed it.</p>

            <content>
              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After the judge’s judgment and order, the Patent was maintained in amended form by the Technical Board of Appeal of the European Patent Office in decision T 732/21 dated 28 September 2022 for reasons given in writing on 12 December 2022. It was common ground on the hearing of the appeal that: (i) this Court had to consider the Patent as so amended; (ii) the amendments made no difference to the obviousness issue; and (iii) the amendments made no difference to the infringement issue considered by the judge, but gave rise to an additional issue which could and should be considered by this Court.</p>

            <content>
              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Each side called two expert witnesses, a biomedical engineer and a clinician. Little turns on the evidence of the clinicians. Med-El’s biomedical engineering expert was Professor Gregg Suaning while Advanced Bionics’s biomedical engineering expert was Professor John Parker. The judge found Prof Parker at [21] and [31] to be “an extremely open and helpful expert”, “a good educator for the court” and “a fair witness” who “came across as keen to assist, educate and willing to make concessions as appropriate”. The judge rejected at [22]-[31] and [223]-[233] criticisms advanced by Med-El that Prof Parker had failed properly to consider the issue from the perspective of the skilled person and that his approach had been tainted by hindsight. By contrast, the judge found Prof Suaning at [20] to be at times “too controlled and overly careful in his answering questions to the point it came across as slightly partisan to the Med-El case”, although “a good educator for the court” who “made sensible concessions as appropriate”. More specifically, the judge’s assessment of Prof Suaning’s evidence as to whether it was common general knowledge that a diametrically magnetised permanent magnet could rotate when interacting with an external magnetic field was that some of his responses “appeared blinkered” and at times he “came across as trying to justify his positions rather than answering the questions” ([49]); and the judge’s assessment of Prof Suaning’s evidence as to the teaching of Zimmerling was that “[h]is answers could come across as evasive and at times contradictory” ([213]). </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Permanent magnets have a magnetic moment which describes the strength and orientation of the magnetic field of the magnet. This is called the magnetic dipole. It is a vector quantity (it has direction). The magnetic fields of two magnets (whether permanent or electromagnetic) will interact with one another. The force induced from that interaction (called torque) will depend on the shape and strength of the magnetic fields. The force is proportional to the magnetic field strength and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the magnets. The tesla (“T”) is the standard unit for magnetic flux density – a measure of the strength of a magnetic field.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">A cochlear implant is a small electronic device that assists a person who is profoundly deaf or hard of hearing to perceive sound. One part – the external component – is placed on the skin behind a person’s ear, while another part – the internal component – is surgically implanted under the skin. The implant works by directly stimulating the neural tissue within the cochlea with electrical pulses, thus bypassing damaged portions of the inner ear. The implant’s signals are sent to the brain, which recognizes the signals as sounds. </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The surgery to implant the internal component is usually performed under general anaesthesia. A small incision is made behind the ear. It is then necessary to perform a mastoidectomy (open the hollow, air-filled spaces in the skull behind the ear) to gain access to the facial recess.  The processor component is placed posteriorly through the skin incision, so it lies over the skull behind the mastoid bone. A pocket may be drilled in the skull to recess some of the device and the lead that goes to the electrode. In some cases, a larger recessed area can be made in the bone that includes the posterior aspect of the implant including the receiver coil, of the internal component to sit in. This larger recessed area requires more exposure and often a bigger incision. Devices being implanted in 2010 were generally thinner than earlier devices, however, and did not generally require bone drilling for the posterior aspect of the implant including the receiver coil and the magnet. </p>

By that date the designs of the internal components of commercial cochlear implants had converged into a flat, thin and planar coil housing (containing the receiver coil, a disk-shaped magnet in the middle of the coil and a silicon chip for sound processing) and a section containing additional electronics which was also flat and of broadly similar depth. The two elements were angled to each other in order to conform to the curve of the skull, as shown below.</p>

Closed bore machines employ a donut-shaped magnet system and the patient is passed through the centre of the donut. When the patient is placed into the bore, the magnetic field lines are aligned along the length of the patient from head to toe. Open systems are open on three to four sides depending on manufacturer and model. The magnetic strength in these machines is significantly lower than in closed bore machines. Open systems typically have their magnetic fields aligned vertically rather than horizontally as in closed bore machines. </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One problem which was well known in 2010 was that the internal axially magnetised disk-shaped permanent magnet of a cochlear implant would, when in close proximity to the external magnetic field of an MRI machine, experience torque. This torque could cause the implanted magnet and its housing to be dislocated, causing improper function of the device, and pain and potentially tissue damage to the patient. This is illustrated by the diagram reproduced below, which is Figure 2 of both Zimmerling and the Patent. It shows the external MRI field B interacting with the magnetisation of the permanent magnet 202. The field lines are perpendicular to each other. The torque created by the interaction is shown by the arrow indicating the rotation of the implant 201 containing permanent magnet 202. The precise strength of the torque will depend on the interaction of the respective magnetic fields.</p>

The first problem is that, as shown in Figure 2 (reproduced in paragraph 20 above), the implanted magnet may experience torque that can twist the magnet and the implant out of position, potentially injuring the wearer. The second problem is that, due to the strong external magnetic field, the implanted magnet may become partly demagnetised and therefore not be strong enough to hold the external component in place. </p>

For example, magnet 302 may be, without limitation, a cylinder that can rotate about its axis. The cylindrical magnet carries a magnetization being normal to its axis. This axis can be arranged horizontally parallel to the skin in the plane of the implanted coil. This allows the magnet to turn around its axis, so that it may turn its magnetic moment either towards the external holding magnet (as is typically the case during normal use) or so as to align with the field generated, for example, by a high field MRI scanner, whose field lines in a typical examination position run along the patient’s axis. In a slightly different arrangement, the axis of the cylinder is still mounted in the plane of the implanted coil, but at approximately up to 45° off the horizontal plane to be able to partially adjust to (lower field) MRI-machines which use vertical magnetic fields. The advantage of a cylindrical magnet is that its aspect ratio (i.e. diameter vs. length) can be chosen such that for a given volume (which is necessary to generate an adequate holding force) the thickness of the magnet is smaller than that of a spherically shaped magnet.”</p>

The torque may displace the internal magnet or the whole implant housing out of proper position and this may damage adjacent tissue in the patient. In addition, the MRI field may reduce or remove the magnetisation of the implant magnet. It may also cause imaging artifacts in the MRI image and may induce voltages in the receiving coil, and hearing artifacts due to the interaction of the external magnetic field of the MRI with the implanted device.</p>

A first attachment magnet 401 is located within the plane of the coil housing 402 and rotatable therein (e.g. a planar disk shape) and has a magnetization direction with a magnetic dipole parallel to the plane of the coil housing 402. An external transmitter coil housing 405 has a corresponding second attachment magnet 404 with a similar magnetic dipole direction parallel to the plane of its coil housing 405 so that when placed on the skin of the recipient patient, their respective magnetic fields cause the two attachment magnets 401 and 404 to self-orient as described above to form a magnetic attraction connection between them.</p>

It teaches that a variety of shapes of internal magnets can be used. Also that varying the orientation of the axis of the rotation of an internal magnet (here a cylinder) to 45 degrees off the horizontal plane provides a compromise position that would rotate sufficiently in an external magnetic field to partially adjust to align with the directions of the different external MRI fields of the two noted MRI systems and provide a thinner magnet than a spherical one. The Skilled Person would recognise that this cylindrical magnet set-up foregoes the ability to rotate in three dimensions and so achieve complete alignment with the external magnetic field. …</p>

All the taught orientations (other than spheres where it appears to depend) have the axis of rotation perpendicular to the skin. I note that Professor Suaning believes the thrust of Zimmerling is to provide a solution that gives a perfect alignment with an MRI field. This does not change the fact that it also discloses the compromise of a partial alignment.”</p>

As counsel for Med-El submitted, that suggestion does not make much technical sense in context.

These show a representation of the Zimmerling cylinder magnet. It then shows a representation of what a disk magnet would look like (this is to demonstrate the geometry point – it is not an acceptance that the Skilled Person would think of shortening the cylinder as shown). Although this disk magnet has its magnetic dipole across its axis of rotation the geometry is such that it is perpendicular to the skin. The final diagram shows the Patent's solution. This is a disk magnet with its magnetic dipole across its axis of rotation. The geometry is now that the plane of rotation is parallel to the skin. Disk magnets were what was used in the cochlear implants at the Priority Date and were CGK. There is no serious dispute that if you wanted to make/buy a relevant disk magnet which was magnetized across its axis of rotation (diametric) this would not be available at the Priority Date. The evidence supports this position. It is not suggested this needed any invention.</p>

The reason I thought of this is because flat, disk shaped magnets were the most commonly used type in the common general knowledge (indeed, almost universally used to my knowledge) and so the easiest way to implement Zimmerling would be to use the designs and components already being used.”</p>

His view is that no-one was thinking about anything other than axial (implant magnets) previously as no-one was thinking about rotating. However, he accepted this type of rotation was taught by Zimmerling. The CGK or Zimmerling taught that it was known – but not that it had been so used in the context of a flat disk-shaped implant magnet.

Even this second aspect – to flip the dipole from axial to diametric –is argued to be obvious in the light of the teaching in Zimmerling once you have the idea of using the CGK disk-implant magnet. This is partly because it is argued using the CGK magnet brings with it the orientation parallel to the coil housing and then the question is – how do I make that rotate? The geometry then dictates that the magnet must be magnetised across its axis of rotation in order to rotate. This is both CGK and taught in Zimmerling.

There is simply not enough relevant information to give rise to finding of a ‘long felt want’. Had this secondary evidence relating to obviousness been found to support a ‘long felt want’ in this case that would have increased its relevance to the overall obviousness assessment. However, as has been explained in the authorities considering this issue, it is secondary evidence and therefore must be kept in its place.  The question would be how would that evidence (had it been made out) have assisted the court in understanding the view of the uninventive skilled person. Based on my conclusions on the approach to the problem here by the skilled person it would not have been enough to change my final assessment on obviousness. I also note militating against the relevancy of this secondary evidence is the fact that various solutions available before the Priority Date (for example removable implant magnets) continue to be used after the Priority date – including in later commercialised Med-El products.”</p>

It provides information on rotating implant magnets which have their dipoles across their axis of rotation to minimise the issue of the interaction with the external fields. The problem here is not to focus on a solution to create a system that can align perfectly. That ideal needs to be looked at in the practical context. The problem is to solve a real world issue for patients. That means a solution that works at clinically relevant angles i.e. works for the patient.</p>

It is obvious to choose the existing CGK disk-shaped magnet implant as one obvious option of a shape of implant magnet to progress in the light of Zimmerling’s teaching. My reasons for this include the following factors; (1) this is a known entity – the shape of the magnet is known to the Skilled Person– ‘it is lying around on the desk’, (2) it is known to have the required magnetic volume to attach to the external magnet – no or minimal extra work is needed, (3) the choice of using the same shape as existing products would be motivated in part by the expectation the regulatory issues may be more straightforward than a new shape (or shapes like spheres), (4) using the existing ‘thin’ shape should avoid the needs for any additional risk of bone drilling which may be required if a bulkier magnet was used, (5) the orientation of the existing assembly housing can be used along with pre-existing system components. Once chosen, the teaching in Zimmerling or the CGK dictates (it is obvious) that the magnetization for the disk-magnet should be changed to being across the axis of rotation to provide for rotation. The Skilled Person would have been able to appreciate the choice of magnet shape and orientation would provide sufficient alignment with an external magnetic field. Based on the teaching in Zimmerling and the views of the experts, once the decision to have the disk-shaped diametrically magnetised magnet is reached the rest of the implementation is obvious and workmanlike and would be expected to succeed. As part of this final consideration my finding is that the choice of a matching external diametric magnet is also obvious for the reasons discussed above. It is a ‘knock-on’ requirement from the earlier decision. …”</p>

Ground 3 is that, “had the judge correctly understood multi-faceted nature of the invention that required insight as to the final solution, he would have appreciated Med-El’s expert’s reluctance to accept the stepwise approach being pressed upon him in cross-examination. Having failed so to appreciate, the judge wrongly criticised Med-El’s expert and afforded his evidence insufficient weight”.

Indeed, as noted above, it is common ground that this is true of Zimmerling itself: the skilled team would not be interested in the magnetic switch disclosed by Zimmerling, but would be interested in the disclosure of rotatable internal magnets. Nevertheless, I would accept that it would be an error of principle for a judge to extract a general teaching from an item of prior art divorced from its context and purpose if that general teaching was not disclosed in the document and would not be discerned by the skilled reader.</p>

Zimmerling disclosed much more than this, and stated at that level of generality this was a statement of the problem of torque caused by the rotation of an implanted magnet in an external magnetic field and not of Zimmerling’s solution to that problem. Rather, what Zimmerling disclosed was the idea of making the internal magnet a shape which allowed rotation of the magnetic dipole away from the position that it was intended to take when in use. In use the dipole remained perpendicular to the skin, but the magnet could temporarily rotate the dipole away from that direction under the influence of the external field of the MRI. Moreover, Zimmerling did not change the external magnet. </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I do not accept this argument. The issue is partly one of interpretation of Zimmerling and partly one of what the skilled engineer would take from it. So far as the interpretation of Zimmerling is concerned, the judge was correct. As noted above, Zimmerling states in the abstract that it discloses an “implantable magnet that can freely turn in response to an external magnetic field, thus avoiding torque”. Furthermore, Zimmerling twice states in the summary of the invention that the magnet is “free to turn/rotate” so that it is “capable of aligning at least partially with an external magnetic field”. This is clearly general teaching not limited to the specific embodiments which follow. If confirmation of this were needed, it is provided by the fact that claim 13 is expressed at the same level of generality. Still further, although it is true to say that the only specific shapes disclosed by Zimmerling are spheres and cylinders, Zimmerling is at pains to say that these are not limiting and that a variety of shapes may be utilised. Finally, Zimmerling discloses a cylindrical  magnet which is diametrically magnetised. Thus it is clearly not limited to axially magnetised internal magnets.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel criticised [208] for two reasons. First, Zimmerling did not describe the sphere as the perfect shape. This is precisely why the judge put the word “perfect” in inverted commas. Secondly, any shape of magnet can fully align with an external magnetic field: the point about a sphere is it is the only shape that can rotate in any direction within the same volume of space. That is clearly what the judge meant.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel criticised [211] on the basis that the judge had wrongly linked Zimmerling’s teaching that a variety of different shapes could be used with its teaching about varying the orientation of the axis of the cylinder by up to 45<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller">o</span>. In fact, the judge separated the two statements by the word “[a]lso”. But in any event the statements are linked, in the sense that the teaching about the cylinder does not apply to the sphere as the judge explained.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel criticised [214] for suggesting that Zimmerling taught “changing the orientation of the magnetic dipole to one that is across the axis of rotation allows the magnet to turn”. This was wrongly put as a general point not specific to any particular shape, and wrongly imported the idea of changing the dipole. As the judge said, however, Prof Suaning accepted that the cylindrical magnet in Zimmerling was diametrically magnetised. Furthermore, that does represent a change from the axial magnetisation of the conventional disk-shaped magnets.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel criticised the first sentence of [215] as an unjustified generalisation. I do not accept this: it is a summary of the points made in the preceding paragraphs. As the judge recognised, in the case of spheres, both the direction of the dipole and the axis of rotation depend on the orientation; but that does not detract from the judge’s summary. Counsel also pointed out that the second sentence of [215] contained an error, but I have dealt with that above.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">This ground of appeal depends on the contention that a core part of the claimed invention was to redefine the problem addressed by the prior art (i.e. Zimmerling). Counsel for Med-El made little attempt either in his skeleton argument or his oral submissions to make that contention good, however. This is not surprising given that Zimmerling and the Patent address precisely the same problem, and even use the same figure to illustrate that problem. Furthermore, it can be seen from Zimmerling and from the Patent that both solutions involve rotation of the internal magnet when exposed to the external magnetic field in an MRI scanner. Med-El’s argument before the judge, which was supported by Prof Suaning’s evidence, was that the invention depended upon a “eureka moment”, namely the insight that one could “flip the dipole” of a conventional disk-shaped magnet from axial to diametric. The problem facing Med-El on the appeal is that the judge confronted this argument head-on and gave reasons supported by the expert evidence for not accepting it.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel criticised the judge’s identification of the differences between Zimmerling and the claimed invention at [220] on the basis that “[w]hat the judge has identified as the difference is [in] fact the Patent’s key contribution”. This is a baffling criticism. It is usually the case that a patent’s key contribution lies in the difference between the claims and the prior art. That does not alter the fact that the court’s task is to ask whether the step from the prior art to the claims was an obvious one.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel criticised [221] as having all the hallmarks of hindsight. I do not accept this. The top diagram illustrates the Zimmerling cylinder magnet. The bottom diagram illustrates the internal magnet in the claimed invention, which is a diametrically magnetised disk-shaped magnet oriented parallel to the skin. As the judge explained, the middle diagram shows a diametrically magnetised disk-shaped magnet oriented perpendicular to the skin. One could understand the charge of hindsight if the judge had suggested or implied that the middle diagram provided a conceptual stepping stone from the top to the bottom, but in fact the judge was careful to say that this was not how the skilled person would think.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Counsel criticised the judge’s reasoning in [242](c), and in particular his statement that Prof Suaning had accepted that “this type of rotation was taught by Zimmerling”. This statement needs to be read in context. The context is that the judge is considering Prof Suaning’s evidence that “no-one was thinking about rotating”. Read in that context, it seems to me that the point the judge is making is that, not only does Zimmerling teach rotation of an internal magnet in an MRI field, but more specifically it teaches rotation of a diametrically magnetised magnet (something that was also common general knowledge). The judge accepts that Zimmerling does not suggest using a flat disk-shaped magnet.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Perhaps most importantly, counsel criticised [246] on the basis that the first step was to decide to use a disk-shaped magnet. Counsel argued that this amounted to a decision to throw away the entirety of Zimmerling’s teaching with respect to the rotatable magnets and to do something entirely different. I do not accept this argument. The judge gave solid reasons, which he summarised in [263], for concluding that it would be obviously desirable to retain the conventional disk-shaped magnet and housing oriented parallel to the skin. This would not involve throwing away Zimmerling’s teaching about using a rotatable magnet to align with the external magnetic field in an MRI scanner. On the contrary, as discussed above, Zimmerling is clear that a variety of shapes may be utilised. In those circumstances it was open to the judge to conclude that it would be obvious to apply Zimmerling’s teaching to a disk-shaped magnet. That would involve using a diametrically magnetised magnet, because otherwise it would not rotate. Zimmerling is clear that a diametrically magnetised magnet may be used. Moreover, it was common general knowledge that a diametrically magnetised magnet can be rotated by an external magnetic field. The judge’s conclusion on this point was supported by the evidence of Prof Parker and the judge gave solid reasons for not accepting the contrary evidence of Prof Suaning. It would also be obvious to adopt a diametrically magnetised disk-shaped external magnet, at which point the skilled team would have arrived within the claim. </p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Med-El contend that the judge made an error of law at [257] in requiring it to be shown that Zimmerling was “well known to all the relevant parties in the industry”. If the judge had treated this point as dispositive of Med-El’s case on long-felt want then I would be disposed to accept this. If there is a long-felt want for a solution to a problem, and two out of three major players in the field are shown to have been aware of prior art relied upon as making the solution obvious but not to have come up with solution until years later, then that is secondary evidence pointing against obviousness even if the third player is not shown to have been aware of that prior art at the time.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The judge’s finding at [258]-[260], however, was that there was no long-felt want for a solution to the problem of MRI compatibility. In essence, it was not thought to be a pressing issue, other solutions were available even if imperfect ones, and the manufacturers had other concerns. In those circumstances awareness of Zimmerling was immaterial. For good measure, the judge considered that, even if long-felt want was established, it would not have altered his conclusion based on the primary evidence of the experts. That was a view he was entitled to take.</p>

            <content>
              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The final point to mention is that Med-El relied upon the decision of the Board of Appeal that the Patent was not obvious over Zimmerling as lending support to their case that the judge had erred. This does not follow. It often possible for two tribunals faced with a finely-balanced issue as to obviousness to reach opposing conclusions without either tribunal making an error. In the present case, the Board of Appeal did not have the evidence of the expert witnesses as to the common general knowledge which was before the judge. For example, there is no mention in the Board’s decision of the fact that it was common general knowledge that a diametrically magnetised magnet can be rotated by an external magnetic field. Nor is there any discussion of the reasons accepted by the judge as to why, based on their common general knowledge, the skilled team would want, if possible, to retain the conventional disc-shaped internal magnet. Thus the fact that the Board reached a different conclusion is more than sufficiently explained by the fact that it did not have the same evidence as the judge.</p>
