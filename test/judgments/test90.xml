            <p style="text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:12pt;color:#000000">The EAT allowed an appeal against the decision of an Employment Judge in which the Claimant’s claims of sex discrimination were struck out at a Preliminary Hearing. The Judge erred in a number of respects. First, the PH had been listed to consider applications to strike out pursuant to r.37 of the ET Rules 2013. However, the Judge, rather than striking out the claims for any identified reason set out in r.37(1)(a) to (e) appeared to have determined, summarily, whether the claims were brought in time (within the meaning of s.123(1) of the EqA 2010) and having determined that they were not, and that there was no act which extended over a period, determined, summarily, that time should not be extended. Further, the Claimant’s claims and allegations had not been properly identified. No evidence was heard and it appeared that no consideration had been given to whether evidence should be prepared or considered in order to determine preliminary issues. Comments made regarding the importance of not allowing the volume of work before Tribunals to lead to decision making without proper procedures being followed. Reiteration of caution in respect of strike out in respect of discrimination claims.</span></p>

That included, the Tribunal later found, a claim of unfair dismissal, automatic unfair dismissal, a claim of sex discrimination and other claims.  The claim of unfair dismissal was lodged within the relevant statutory limitation period. Although it was a little difficult to define precisely the claims made by the Claimant in the Claim Form, the Claimant complained both about his dismissal which took place in December 2019 and also about conduct which was said to have occurred before that. In particular, in the opening paragraph of the form, where he was required to describe the details of his claim, he complained that he was denied promotion on three occasions in three consecutive years for jobs which were then offered to women who were less qualified than him. In addition, he complained that he had been bullied and harassed in 2018. His claim about dismissal was also linked to a complaint he made about being refused a sabbatical.</span></p>

He had communicated with the Respondent about that matter. Correspondence took place about whether the Respondent would grant him leave of absence so that he could take up that alternative post for a period of time. Ultimately, he made an application for a sabbatical. That application for a sabbatical was not granted. Nonetheless, the Claimant appears to have accepted the role he was offered with Coventry University.</span></p>

He asserted that, conversely, when he asked for a sabbatical, he was” dragged through the disciplinarian circus”. He complained about applications for posts he had made, asserting that women were appointed who were less qualified than him. He stated that, in that regard, he was treated less favourably than an actual comparator, “Female 1”: her husband had been ill and she was given time away from teaching for a whole year. On the contrary, he stated that when he broke his leg, he was dragged through months of disciplinary investigations.</span></p>

I accepted the submissions on behalf of the Claimant that the precise basis and grounds upon which those Orders were sought was not entirely clear in the email. It was clear, however, that the Respondent was asserting that the claims of sex discrimination, harassment, bullying, and victimisation were time barred and should be struck out. Further, the Respondent appeared to assert that the claims of sex discrimination, and some of his other claims, were scandalous, vexatious and had no reasonable prospect of success and should be struck out. Alternatively, the Respondent appeared to seek an order that the Claimant should be made to pay a deposit as a condition of proceeding with his claim(s).</span></p>

First, it appears to be common ground that, in breach of the directions provided in the letter of 18 October 2020, written submissions were not sent to either party not less than seven days before the hearing. The Respondent provided written submissions to the Tribunal and to the Claimant less than a day before the hearing on 16 March 2021. The Respondent’s proposed draft List of Issues and Agenda for the hearing were sent to the Claimant on 15 March 2021, again, just the day before the PH.  During the hearing, the Judge stated that that had allowed the Claimant all of 16 March 2021 to consider the Agenda, and some time on the day before the PH to consider the written submissions. The Claimant provided his written submissions to the Tribunal and to the Respondent approximately half an hour before the PH began.  I have made a point of including this in this Judgment because I consider that the exchange of those important documents, very shortly before the PH, will not have assisted the parties in presenting their application(s) and responding to them. Little time was available to properly reflect on what the issues were. It is possible that, in turn, this did not assist the Employment Judge. In addition, the (late) provision of documents, shortly before a hearing, creates additional difficulties for litigants in person. It can increase anxiety, make participation in that hearing on an equal footing with counsel and solicitors more difficult, alternatively, give an impression that that is not being achieved. That, in turn, is also unlikely to facilitate meaningful discussion regarding other means of dispute resolution. All these points are relevant to the parties’ roles in assisting the Tribunal in furthering the overriding objective. Rules and directions for the preparation for a hearing are made for a reason. They should, except in exceptional circumstances, be adhered to.</span></p>

The Claimant was notified that he had been unsuccessful following various applications in July 2016, February 2017, 28 February 2018, 28 January 2019 and 22 February 2019.  As regards the last of those, on 22 February 2019 the three-month primary limitation period would have expired on 21 May 2019.

The grievances against the Claimant were dealt with between March and June 2018. Consequently, the three-month primary limitation period would have expired in May 2019 and, again, the Claim Form is approximately one year out of time. One item of treatment relates to the Respondent allegedly being hostile to the Claimant when he returned from sickness in 2018 and the Claimant told me that this hostility resumed in November 2018. As regards this allegation, the primary limitation period would have expired in about February 2019 and, accordingly, the Claim Form is in excess of one year out of time.</span></p>

He told me he did rely upon the three occasions when his applications for promotion failed. He told me that he was not sure if gender had any influence insofar as the handling of the grievances found against him were concerned. He complained of his treatment when he went off sick in February 2018 and on his return to work in February 2019 with a month’s investigation into him when he was not told what he was being investigated about. He says that he was subjected to unwarranted behaviour repeated a year later which he characterised as bullying and harassment in November 2018. He relied on the denial of being offered a sabbatical in June, July and September 2019. He made a generalised allegation against the Respondent’s Dean, Anna Cypranou, accusing her of orchestrating all the treatment that the Claimant complains about.</span></p>

In addition, putting the issue of sabbatical leave to the side meant that the Judge failed to take into account the fact that it was the non-granting of sabbatical leave and then taking up the work with Coventry University which appears to have led to the dismissal. By simply  leaving aside the issue of sabbatical leave, the Judge removed from his consideration the possibility that there was an allegation of sex discrimination which culminated in dismissal, albeit it had begun much sooner than June or July of 2019.</span></p>

Whilst that may be a matter of dispute between the parties and I make no finding, in my judgment it would appear that the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings were[sic] of a totally different nature of the alleged treatment relied upon by the Claimant in support of his other sex discrimination claims.”</span></p>

The Judge did not make any finding about the factual issues in dispute regarding the initiation of the disciplinary proceedings and his taking up of a full-time appointment. The Judge was not, therefore, in a position to discern whether those issues were of a different nature to the treatment relied upon by the Claimant.  The Claimant asserted that they were all linked because, as a man, he was treated less favourably than a woman. His claim form appeared to assert that within the Respondent organisation in which he worked, women were treated more favourably than men. Whether those allegations would have been established at trial is a different matter. However, what the Judge could not do was, on the one hand, recognise the need to take the Claimant’s case at its highest, and then, on the other, simply not do so.</span></p>

That is obviously totally incorrect. It is clear that the Claimant had union advice during the relevant period as they were involved in his grievances. The Claimant also told me that in February 2018, rather than complain, he kept his mouth shut and carried on with business as usual.  The Claimant is an intelligent and articulate man who, if he considered he had been discriminated against on grounds of sex, could and should have been able to instigate a claim relating to those distinct acts sooner.</span></p>

I consider it is arguable that the EJ failed to distinguish between a strike-out of the Claim because there are no reasonable prospects that it will be found to be within time under rule 37.1(a) and 53(1)(c) of the ET rules and determining whether a claim is out of time as a preliminary issue. Rule 53(1)(b) and 3 of the ET rules.  Determination of a preliminary issue against a party does not result in a claim being struck out but in it being dismissed.  Determining a preliminary issue would generally require prior orders for preparation including the identification of the issues and for evidence on matters such as whether it is just and equitable to apply a time limit in excess of three months. It is arguable that the EJ did not properly direct himself as to the law applicable to strike-out and/or the determination of preliminary issues. It is arguable that the EJ determined the time point as if it were a preliminary issue, although the preliminary hearing had not been listed to determine a preliminary issue and no orders had been made to prepare to determine a preliminary issue”.</span></p>

Secondly, the Tribunal should then consider whether it should exercise its discretion to strike the claim out. There are also a number of cases which contain guidance as to the proper approach to considering limitation issues at a preliminary stage of proceedings and also generally in respect of preliminary hearings.  In particular, in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Caterham School Limited v Rose</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> (UKEAT/0149RN) the EAT, His Honour Judge Auerbach, emphasised the importance of ensuring that there is clarity as to the purposes of a preliminary hearing and what is to be considered. I agree. If crucial, at times, wholly determinative issues are to be decided at a preliminary hearing it is an essential tenet of a fair process that the parties should know what those issues are and have had adequate notice of them so as to be able to fairly and properly address them and their implications for the claims before the Tribunal. </span></p>

Strike-out applications may be made wholly on submission, taking the case of the party whose claim or response is at risk of strike-out at its highest.  Fair and just determination of a preliminary issue may require evidence to be given, including oral evidence, and a factual determination to be made so as to reach a definitive outcome on a point which cannot be re-visited at a full merits hearing.  In many cases that will require either, agreed case management directions or a hearing to identify the issues which will be considered at the preliminary hearing so that directions can be made as to how and when evidence should be prepared and considered. In addition, the terms or r.54 of the ET Rules of Procedure 2014 are mandatory: in the case of a preliminary hearing  involving ‘preliminary issues’ as defined in r.53(3) (i.e. those which may determine liability), at least 14 days notice must be given </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">and</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> that notice must </span><span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">‘specify’</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> the preliminary issues that are, or may be determined.</span></p>

The need for effective case management and application of the principles set out in the overriding objective is clear. That, however, cannot be any justification for short cuts where that leads to unjust or unfair consideration of important issues and claims.  Whilst unnecessary delay is inconsistent with the proper administration of justice, “justice must never be sacrificed on the altar of speed”.  (See, albeit in a different jurisdiction, but where delay was particularly significant becasuse of a statutory time limit for proceedings per Paulfley J. in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Re: NL (A child) </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">[2014] EWHC 270).</span></p>

First, the position of litigants in person. Lawyers will be, or should be, familiar with the rules of procedure; litigants in person may not be. They may not appreciate the significance of a PH at which a preliminary issue is to be determined. Employment Judges must be astute to ensure that before such a hearing proceeds, particularly one where preliminary issues (as defined above) are determined. a litigant in person has had adequate notice of both the hearing, the issues to be determined, has understood the purpose of the hearing and (if appropriate) has had time to reflect upon the need for evidence. Secondly, the question of whether and when some issues should be determined at a preliminary hearing. One party may be keen to proceed with a preliminary hearing to determine what, from their perspective is a knock-out point. For the other, however, that may mean that determination of a key issue has taken place before a full hearing on the merits and prior to disclosure having taken place. It is vitally important, in my judgment, not to lose sight of the previously well stated principle: discrimination is highly fact sensitive. It is not uncommon that most of the documentary evidence will be in the hands of one party. It is for all these reasons that the principles have been stated, time and time again, that only in the clearest of cases should a discrimination case be struck out without full consideration of the merits.</span></p>

In practice, those issues may be so closely inter-twined with merits of the claims themselves. For example, it may not be possible to determine whether an act extended over a period within the meaning of s123(3) of the EqA 1010. unless and until a decision is made about whether separate incidents amounted to unlawful discrimination. Consequently, there may be no appreciable saving of time in seeking to determine those limitation issues at a preliminary hearing.

In that case the EAT had considered an appeal from a tribunal’s determination that treatment complained of, up to and including a complaint of constructive dismissal, had all formed part of a “conduct extending over a period” for the purposes of s.123(3)(a) of the EqA 2010.

With respect to His Honour Judge Auerbach, I do not share his view as stated at paragraph 59, that: “A strike out application in respect of some part of a claim can (and should) be approached assuming, for that purpose, the facts to be as pleaded by the Claimant. <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">That does not require evidence or actual findings of fact</span>.” (emphasis added.) It seems to me that the emphasised parts of such a conclusion are at odds with the conclusion of Hooper LJ, at paragraphs 10 and 11 of <span style="font-weight:bold">Lyfar</span> (cited above), by which I am bound. It is also at odds with the way in which such cases proceed in practice and without criticism by the higher courts – see, for example, <span style="font-weight:bold">Hendricks</span>, at paragraph 22, from which it is clear that the claimant had produced a 42-page witness statement and given oral evidence at the preliminary hearing. In my judgment, whilst, in any given case, it may be possible and appropriate to determine a strike-out application by reference to the pleaded case alone, it cannot be said that that approach should be adopted on every occasion. That is not to say that the tribunal is to consider the assertions made by the claimant uncritically, or to disregard any implausible aspects of the claimant’s case, taken at its highest. Save, possibly, to highlight any factual basis for asserted implausibility (which is not synonymous with the mere running of an alternative case), one would not expect evidence to be called by a respondent in relation to the existence, or otherwise, of a prima facie case (see, for example, paragraph 36 of <span style="font-weight:bold">Hendricks</span>; and paragraphs 23 and 35 of <span style="font-weight:bold">Aziz</span>). </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'" />There has to be a reasonable attempt at identifying the claims and the issues before considering strike out or making a deposit order. In some cases, a proper analysis of the pleadings, and any core documents in which the claimant seeks to identify the claims, may show that there really is no claim, and there are no issues to be identified; but more often there will be a claim if one reads the documents carefully, even if it might require an amendment. Strike out is not a way of avoiding rolling up one’s sleeves and identifying, in reasonable detail, the claims and issues; doing so is a prerequisite of considering whether the claim has reasonable prospects of success. Often it is argued that a claim is bound to fail because there is one issue that is hopeless. For example, in the protected disclosure context, it might be argued that the claimant will not be able to establish a reasonable belief in wrongdoing; however, it is generally not possible to analyse the issue of wrongdoing without considering what information the claimant contends has been disclosed and what type of wrongdoing the claimant contends the information tended to show. </p>

They need to assist the employment tribunal in identifying what, on a fair reading of the pleadings and other key documents in which the claimant sets out the case, the claims and issues are. Respondents, particularly if legally represented, in accordance with their duties to assist the tribunal to comply with the overriding objective and not to take procedural advantage of litigants in person, should assist the tribunal to identify the documents, and key passages of the documents, in which the claim appears to be set out, even if it may not be explicitly pleaded in a manner that would be expected of a lawyer, and take particular care if a litigant in person has applied the wrong legal label to a factual claim that, if properly pleaded, would be arguable. In applying for strike out, it is as well to take care in what you wish for, as you may get it, but then find that an appeal is being resisted with a losing hand. </p>

So far as they can, they should seek to explain their claims clearly even though they may not know the correct legal terms. They should focus on their core claims rather than trying to argue every conceivable point. The more prolix and convoluted the claim is, the less a litigant in person can criticise an employment tribunal for failing to get to grips with all the possible claims and issues. Litigants in person should appreciate that, usually, when a tribunal requires additional information it is with the aim of clarifying, and where possible simplifying, the claim, so that the focus is on the core contentions. The overriding objective also applies to litigants in person, who should do all they can to help the employment tribunal clarify the claim. The employment tribunal can only be expected to take reasonable steps to identify the claims and issues. But respondents, and tribunals, should remember that repeatedly asking for additional information and particularisation rarely assists a litigant in person to clarify the claim. Requests for additional information should be as limited and clearly focussed as possible.”</p>

It was submitted that there were a number of errors of law in respect of the approach of the Tribunal. First, the Tribunal proceeded to hear something where notice had not been properly given of that preliminary issue. In addition, no proper case management had taken place in advance of the preliminary hearing prior to determining that substantive issue. Thirdly, the judge failed to apply the two-stage approach outlined in case law, in particular in the case of </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">Balls v Downham Market High School</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302"> and also in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">HM Prison Service v Dolby</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">.  It failed to consider which of the specified grounds for striking out the Claim had been established and it then failed to step back and ask itself whether or not it was appropriate to strike out the Claims on that basis. Further, it was submitted that the Tribunal failed to direct itself to the applicable and relevant law and in particular failed to comply with the principles set out in paragraphs paragraph 50 of Ellenbogen J.’s Judgment in </span><span style="font-weight:bold;text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">E v X, L and Z</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">. </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt;color:#010302">It was submitted that the Judge wrongly determined that the acts complained of were a series of distinct acts rather than conduct which extended over a period of time.

It was submitted that the Judge looked at the substance of the allegations made by the Claimant and concluded that the Claimant had not established that there was an act which extended over a period. In particular, the Judge had regard to inconsistencies within the Claimant’s own pleaded case. For example, in relation to one or two allegations of discrimination the Claimant appeared to have identified a male comparator and complained about more favourable treatment granted to a male comparator.  It was submitted that the Judge approached the case considering the Claimant’s case at its highest and that he did, in fact, adopt the relevant two stage approach. It was submitted that the guidance set out by Ellenbogen J, was guidance only, but that in any event the Judge had clearly complied with it.</span></p>

The Judge’ summary of the claims failed to refer to clear and relevant aspects of the Claimant’s case.

In determining that there was not an act which extended over the period the Judge referred to the number of individuals who were said to be involved in the alleged sex discrimination. Whilst the Judge directed himself that the number of individuals involved was a relevant, but not conclusive, factor he, nonetheless, appeared to have treated this as a conclusive factor. I have already alluded to the fact that I am concerned that, although the Judge warned himself that he should  take the Claimant’s case at its highest, he did not do so because he did not consider the way in which the Claimant put his case and nor did he consider the link the Claimant sought to make between the refusal to grant him a sabbatical and the subsequent disciplinary proceedings.</span></p>

The notice given did not ‘specify’ as required by the rules (r.54 read in conjunction with r.53) the preliminary issue (as defined in r.53(3) which was, potentially, determinative) which was, or might be, considered at the hearing. The lack of adequate notice was then compounded by the late provision of documents and the fact that the basis for the preliminary hearing appeared to change at the hearing. I also consider that there was an apparent conflation of a preliminary issue and a strike-out application. To some extent, this is evident from the Judge’s Judgment, where the Judge held that the Claims were out of time and then struck them out. Strictly speaking, if the claims were out of time, the Judgment should have reflected that fact and then recorded that consequently, the Tribunal had no jurisdiction to hear them. The use of the phrase ‘strike out’ is suggestive of r. 37 of the ET Rules of Procedure 2013 and strike out on one of the grounds set out in r.37(1)(a) to (e).</span></p>

What is required is that the case is returned to the Tribunal to consider, presumably, the strike-out application and/or the issues of time in respect of jurisdiction. I suggest, although ultimately it is a matter for the Tribunal, that initially a directions hearing takes place, that there is proper and identification of the Claimant’s claims, that the Claimant sets out the basis upon which he will assert that the Dean had oversight and involvement in the decisions about which he had complained, including significantly, the decision in respect of the sabbatical and other earlier decisions. Having carried out that exercise, it may be the case that the Claimant determines not to proceed with all of the individual allegations of discrimination. He is of course entitled to rely on those facts, not as a claim, but to support his complaint that discrimination took place at a later date. </span></p>
