            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Twenty pages long, not counting a schedule of works that was proposed to be attached, the document bore the title “Gas Supply and Processing Agreement for Accelerated Gas Development” (“the GSPA”).</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">One party to the GSPA was the Federal Government of Nigeria (“Nigeria”). Nigeria did almost nothing to perform the GSPA after signing, but, according to Nigeria, neither did the other party.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">On the face of things, a dispute followed and then an arbitration to resolve that dispute. The result, according to the decision of an arbitration tribunal in 2017, was that Nigeria owed the other party US$6.6 billion, a sum so vast that it is material to Nigeria’s entire federal budget. With interest at the rate awarded by the Tribunal, the amount now exceeds US$11 billion.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The other party to the GSPA was a company registered in the British Virgin Islands. Its name was Process &amp; Industrial Developments Limited (“P&amp;ID”). It was one of many companies co-founded by two Irish businessmen, Mr Michael Quinn and Mr Brendan Cahill.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The GSPA has its place part of the way along a timeline that spans two decades. Nigeria had a chronic shortage of electric power. Yet gas from the recovery of oil in Nigeria was being flared rather than used to generate electricity, causing harmful pollution in the process.<span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller"> </span>The GSPA came as Nigeria embarked on a policy named the Accelerated Gas Development Project to tackle this.</p>

          <num>7.</num>
          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As summarised by the parties, under the GSPA Nigeria was to supply specified quantities of “wet” gas to Gas Processing Facilities (GPFs) constructed by P&amp;ID. P&amp;ID was to strip the wet gas into “lean” gas, to be delivered to Nigeria to be used for power generation. The remaining natural gas liquids were to be retained by P&amp;ID for onward sale either domestically or by export. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The stated duration of the GSPA was 20 years (or more, on one scenario). It is common ground that in the event Nigeria did not supply any wet gas to P&amp;ID, and nor did P&amp;ID construct any Gas Processing Facilities.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In the third year of the GSPA, the arbitration (“the Arbitration”) was commenced by P&amp;ID against Nigeria, relying on an arbitration clause in the GSPA. The arbitral tribunal (“the Tribunal”) was of the greatest experience and standing. Sir Anthony Evans was nominated to the Tribunal by P&amp;ID. Chief Bayo Ojo SAN was nominated by Nigeria. Lord Hoffmann was appointed Chairman on 29 January 2013. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">After rejecting a challenge to its jurisdiction, the Tribunal in due course found, by a part final award dated 17 July 2015 (“the Award on Liability”), that Nigeria had committed a repudiatory breach of the GSPA, that the GSPA was terminated on P&amp;ID accepting that repudiatory breach, and that Nigeria was liable in damages. The Tribunal published a further award dated 31 January 2017 dealing with quantum (“the Final Award”). Chief Ojo SAN published a dissenting opinion. The Final Award required Nigeria to pay P&amp;ID US$ 6.6 billion. Interest was awarded at the rate of 7%.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Before this Court, the Commercial Court in London, Nigeria challenges the Award on Liability and the Final Award (“the Awards”), and an award on jurisdiction. It makes allegations of bribery, corruption and perjury. The allegations extend to the GSPA, but they then extend further across the arbitral process as a whole from arbitration agreement to Final Award. </p>

          <num>12.</num>
          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The allegations by Nigeria include allegations of bribery and corruption by P&amp;ID before, at and after the time the parties entered into the GSPA. It alleges that some of its own lawyers at the time of the arbitration, including two Leading Counsel, were corrupted by P&amp;ID. The allegations extend further still to early stages of the challenge before this Court. In turn, for its part, P&amp;ID expressly describes Nigeria’s case against it as “false and dishonest”.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I address Nigeria’s challenge and P&amp;ID’s defence in this judgment. The judgment follows an 8-week hearing by way of trial in the first quarter of this year. I intend no criticism of the legal teams when I record that Nigeria made almost every allegation it could. The express concessions by either Nigeria or P&amp;ID were limited. I have read and listened to extensive evidence from witnesses of fact, including rigorous cross examination of witnesses tendered by P&amp;ID. There has been evidence from expert witnesses, and argument from legal teams of true distinction, experience and expertise. A large amount of documentation, some of it incomplete, has had to be reviewed and re-reviewed, including in the months after the hearing. Many of these features are highly unusual in the context of the proper limits to the role of the Court where the parties have chosen arbitration.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But this is a highly unusual case, although one that draws attention to matters of wider importance. Quite apart from the consequences for the parties, the matter touches the reputation of arbitration as a dispute resolution process.</p>

That cross examination was rigorous; part of a “powerful and unforgiving microscope” was how P&amp;ID put it. I have made allowance where appropriate for the demanding style of the cross examination when assessing the witness testimony. At some points the cross examination included questions that invited views from witnesses of fact rather than their recollection or claimed recollection, with the result that some exchanges were not of evidential value (I say this with no lack of respect and with genuine understanding of how demanding was the task of questioning in this case). Some observations on individual witnesses appear in the course of the judgment.</p>

When once his actual state of mind as to knowledge or belief as to facts is established, the question whether his conduct was honest or dishonest is to be determined by the fact-finder by applying the (objective) standards of ordinary decent people.

They initially planned to obtain wet gas from the Aje Field, operated by Yinka Folawiyo Petroleum Company Ltd. Folawiyo did express interest in supplying the gas in 2007. By April 2008, Folawiyo proposed a formula for calculating the price of the gas, and the parties scheduled a further meeting to finalise an agreement. But then Chevron took a major shareholding in Folawiyo in about early 2008, and was interested in taking the gas itself. </p>

The obstacle to Project Alpha was that Tita-Kuru and P&amp;ID could not reach an agreement with Folawiyo to acquire the wet gas required. The experience of this obstacle caused P&amp;ID to seek a supply of gas in the public sector from Nigeria.

It is common ground that a representative from P&amp;ID attended the Road Show. The programme indicated that Dr Rilwanu Lukman was due to attend and on balance I conclude he did. At this date Dr Lukman was not a Minister although he had served a previous term from 1986-1990, and he would take up the office again later in 2008. The Road Show featured (among other things) a “Proposed Gas Master Plan Central Processing Facility”.</p>

Of the term “Dublin expenses”, in an email exchange of September 2007, Mr Murray had referred Mr Lloyd Quinn to the need to record Dublin expenses in a coded list which “can be instantly destroyed or is illegible to a stranger”. Nigeria alleges that some of this sum was used to make cash payments to Nigerian officials present at the Roadshow. This has not been properly explained by P&amp;ID, despite the allegation and the opportunity to explain properly, the concern for secrecy and the timing of the withdrawal. I accept that some of this money was used in the way alleged.</p>

I accept that this reflected P&amp;ID’s then understanding to the effect that a project at Calabar would adopt the same design as had already been developed for Project Alpha. On that basis P&amp;ID believed that the extensive engineering work that had already been done on Project Alpha would continue to be of at least some use for the Calabar Project. In February 2009, Mr Cahill said to Mr Vlok that “[a] vast amount of engineering work has been done to date on the propylene project […]”, and asked “[t]o what extent if any is the engineering work done to date applicable and usable”. As P&amp;ID contend, Mr Vlok’s answer was, in essence, that as the concept changed, P&amp;ID could continue to reuse and adapt the existing engineering work as well as carrying out new engineering work where required.</p>

A little later, in the interests of moving more quickly, the Ministry and P&amp;ID discussed a second major change. This involved dividing the gas processing plant into two ‘trains’. The idea was that an initial train with a capacity (then of) 180-200 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCuFD) of wet gas could get up and running first; to be followed by a second train with a further capacity (then of) 250 MMSCuFD.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mrs Grace Taiga was not the only person involved for Nigeria in the drafting. On 17 December 2009 Mr Murray sent a draft GSPA to Mr Cahill to reflect observations in a memorandum that Dr Ibrahim (Chair of the Ministry’s Technical Committee) had provided to Mr Quinn that day, and some handwritten markings. Mr Hitchcock also met Mr Tijani at the Ministry of Petroleum Resources.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Originally (as at 1 September 2009) the draft had contained a Nigerian law clause. There was an arbitration clause, and that said that the “venue” of the arbitration should be “Abuja, Nigeria or otherwise as agreed by the Parties”. Arcadia commented in November: “English law is preferable”. On this Mr Michael Quinn wrote: “Arcadia want English Law – We have located Arbitration in London instead but staying with Nigerian Law”. The revised draft changed the “venue” of the arbitration to “London, England or otherwise as agreed by the Parties”.</p>

I accept the realism of Lord Wolfson KC’s point that Dr Lukman “who had served as OPEC’s Secretary General and nine times as its President was plainly able to decide for himself whether [Nigeria] should sign the GSPA”. Here I can accept Mrs Grace Taiga’s evidence that: </p>

                    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in">“what I meant by that is that I am submitting the agreement as having been duly prepared for your signature. That is usual civil service language. ‘I advise’ does not mean he’s bound to take what I said, and I advised ‘subject’ … means that he is an icon in the oil industry, he knows better.”</p>

There was no mention of Article 6 and how it might work. Mrs Grace Taiga did not say to Dr Lukman words to the effect, and in line with what the Tribunal would later find: “You do realise that if you do not source the gas then P&amp;ID might terminate for breach and Nigeria could be liable for billions of dollars even if P&amp;ID has not started on the GPFs at Calabar”. There was no mention even of the desirability of further legal advice.</p>

Mr Ajumogobia SAN wrote in these terms in manuscript on 16 January 2010: “D/Legal [Mrs Grace Taiga] Pls forward copy to DPR for comments”. Mrs Grace Taiga then wrote to the Department of Petroleum Resources saying Mr Ajumogobia SAN had approved the letter and the Department being provided with a copy of the GSPA, and had directed the Department to comment on it with a view to its implementation “with the relevant [international oil companies]”.</p>

Leaving aside Article 20 (dealing with applicable law and dispute resolution), it added very little detail to that found in the MOU. Where it did add the detail is remarkably lacking: see Article 8g for example.</p>

First, P&amp;ID’s responsibilities under the GSPA “to ensure the fastrack implementation of this Project” to construct and incorporate two or more process streams with a total capacity of 400 MMSCuFD together with all utilities, an absolute obligation under the MOU (see Article 7a of the MOU), had become a “best endeavours” obligation in the GSPA (see Article 7a of the GSPA). Second, Article 6d in the GSPA was not found in the MOU, and I have seen no sign in the contemporaneous documentation that any consideration was given to how acceptable this was for a sovereign state in the context of a 20 year contract.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">P&amp;ID lays understandable emphasis on the point that the GSPA was not the only contract entered into under the Accelerated  Gas Development Project. Each of the other contracts is different but with similarities. Neither party made comprehensive submissions at the trial on all differences and similarities. But an obligation on Nigeria to deliver a quantity of gas without cost (see Article 6(b) of the GSPA) is to be found in a number of them: with Petrolog, with Global, with Davubic, with a consortium led by Drake and with Octopol. The expert evidence further showed that this is relevant and important to the ability to finance. Within the contracts there are examples of recitals similar to those in the GSPA (themselves largely derived from the MOU as discussed above). </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Nigeria accepts none of the other contracts were approved by or notified to the Bureau of Public Procurement or the Federal Executive Council. Nigeria’s Infrastructure Concession Regulatory Commission was later to state to Nigeria’s Force Intelligence Bureau that the GSPA was not submitted to the Commission for review and compliance certification, but Nigeria accepts that none of the other contracts were notified to the Bureau either. In its Statement of Case in the litigation that has followed before this Court (and which is dated 18 September 2020), Nigeria was to contend that the arbitration clause in the GSPA departed from the model arbitration clause that Nigerian government departments had been directed to use in their contracts. I regard these last points ultimately as marginal. They are as consistent with haste behind the GSPA and failed bureaucracy as with the corruption that Nigeria alleges, and there is much that leaves me unclear on how often these requirements were in practice complied with in Nigeria at the time.</p>

The bribe may have been offered by the payer or sought by the agent. A bribe encompasses not just a payment of money but the conferring of any advantage or benefit, and may be an actual benefit or merely the promise of a benefit held out by the payer or an expectation of one. </p>

P&amp;ID’s position is that payments were made for non-corrupt reasons, and in particular to meet Mrs Grace Taiga’s medical expenses. I accept that she had periods of illness and that part of her reason for wanting the payments was to enable her to meet costs of healthcare. I also accept that she wanted to help her daughter with accommodation. But keeping these and other payments secret from her employer, Nigeria, was deliberate and the reason for this was that she knew the payments were corrupt rather than because she believed they were a private matter that was irrelevant to her employment.</p>

Ms Grace Taiga accepted in her oral evidence that, in paying her money, Mr Michael Quinn was seeking to ingratiate himself in the expectation that she would in return “view him favourably”.

So too Mr Hitchcock’s response that “Not necessary, everything is up to us”. If there were limits to her drafting expertise, Mrs Taiga did not propose, as a faithful lawyer would to their client in that circumstance, that further legal resources be brought in to help ensure that the drafting suitably protected Nigeria.</p>

These payments at the point of her retirement may have been for her part in getting the GSPA and to encourage her to remain quiet about what had happened, but without more evidence about their source than was available to me at this trial I do not find they were.</p>

In 2011 P&amp;ID shared an alternative proposed solution with Nigeria, involving their processing (with the assistance of an offshore facility) all currently flared associated gas from OML 123 (put at 180 MMSCuFD) and the use of lean gas to maintain pressure.</p>

This came to coincide with an important policy principle for the Nigerian Government known as the "Liquids Based Pricing Approach". This is described in the Government's National Domestic Gas Supply and Pricing Policy as follows (page 10 of MQ1): </p>

                      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in">GAS PRICING REFORM - LIQUIDS BASED PRICING APPROACH A widely known characteristic of Nigerian gas is its relative richness in liquids i.e. NGLs. NGLs continue to attract a high price in international markets (similar trend in crude oil pricing). As a result of the potential high revenue that comes from NGLs produced in conjunction with residue dry gas, it is possible for a gas supply project to accommodate a relatively lower price for the residue dry gas and still be a profitable supply project. Residue dry gas is used mostly in the domestic market. This gas pricing policy aims to exploit this intrinsic value of NGLs in deriving a relatively low gas price for the strategic domestic sector - Power. It is recognized that not all gas resources in the country are rich in NGLs, consequently, it is intended that this philosophy be applied selectively - especially in the short term as the Power sector is currently unable to pay higher price for gas (in view of the low end user power tariff that currently obtains in Nigeria). It is however the expectation that in the medium term, power tariff will be more commercial and a higher gas price will be achievable.”</p>

I would estimate that the total costs sunk into the preparatory work during that period were in excess of $40 million, including initial feasibility studies, the cost of licences for the technology required to operate the gas stripping plant and the propylene plant respectively, the production of detailed engineering drawings and our own internal project management costs.</p>

The cost of the work of these 3 companies alone was about $29 million. In addition our own internal costs were significant.

P&amp;ID had to continue to tell these lies, says Nigeria because, had it not done so, it would have been obvious that P&amp;ID was never going to be able to perform a gas processing contract on the scale of the GSPA, with the required capital expenditure and on the expedited timeframe involved. Nigeria further says that without the lies it would have been obvious “no suitable gas sources for the contract existed”, and that P&amp;ID had been awarded the contract by paying bribes to officials. In response in its Defence dated 6 November 2020, P&amp;ID denied that the evidence of Mr Michael Quinn was perjured and denied that any alleged perjury was material to the outcome of the arbitration.</p>

Nigeria has to accept that (as it puts it) “in the most literal sense” the phrase was true. But it goes on to say that Mr Michael Quinn “conspicuously omitted” “that the allocation was conditional upon two steps being taken by P&amp;ID”.

The first of the two steps to which Nigeria refers - the requirement for payment of a fee - was there for Nigeria and the Tribunal to see in the exhibit (letter dated 16 February 2010 at page 159 of the exhibit).

P&amp;ID criticises a case put in this way on a number of grounds (often challenging the proposed implied language of “wholly legitimate circumstances”), describing it at one point as a form of reverse-engineering that did not “distinguish between what a document does not say and what it impliedly represents” and referring to <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Raiffeisen Zentralbank Osterreich AG v RBS</span> [2011] 1 Lloyd’s Rep 123 at [84].

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">P&amp;ID tries to answer the case in a number of ways. It says first that Mr Michael Quinn did not fraudulently misrepresent that no payments had been made. But Mr Michael Quinn told the Tribunal that he was explaining how the relevant contract came about. He knew that bribery of Mrs Grace Taiga was involved in bringing the GSPA about but his explanation deliberately excluded that fact. The statement was false, and I am satisfied that Mr Michael Quinn (and P&amp;ID) knew it and were dishonest. In its written closing P&amp;ID says that “all but one sentence of Mr Quinn’s evidence was accurate”. In my judgment one sentence is enough, when it said what it did. Mr Michael Quinn and P&amp;ID knew the true position and that was why they chose to use the sentence because it would help conceal the true position. </p>

P&amp;ID puts this as “whether the Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear P&amp;ID’s claim”. But the evidence P&amp;ID put forward was clear, and it was redeployed in further stages of the Arbitration after the jurisdiction stage.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">P&amp;ID contends that it was under no duty to disclose the existence of any pre-GSPA payments. The question whether, absent the decision to offer the explanation in the witness statement, there was a duty to disclose may be open to debate. P&amp;ID contends there was no duty for several reasons. First, the arbitration was adversarial. Second, it was governed by the rules appended to the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act which provide that a party may, but does not have to, annex to their statement of claim or defence the documents which they deem relevant or rely on (Article 18(3) and 19(2)) and that at any time during arbitral proceedings the arbitral tribunal may require the parties to produce documents, exhibits or other evidence (Article 24(2)). Third, none of the Procedural Orders made by the Tribunal contained a duty to disclose relevant documents that was akin to the rules for disclosure in commercial litigation in England &amp; Wales, and nor did the parties exchange Redfern Schedules (a form of disclosure schedule). Fourth, P&amp;ID argues there is not a duty to advise an opponent of substantive defences. </p>

The same is true for a contention by P&amp;ID that failure to disclose documents and records showing that bribes had been paid when they had not been ordered to be disclosed was not a fraud.

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">P&amp;ID advances the argument that the present was a case of ‘saying nothing’ rather than ‘impliedly representing something’. The argument was (a) that Mr Quinn said nothing in his evidence about pre-GSPA payments, (b) this was because there was no issue in the arbitration as to whether P&amp;ID (or anyone associated with it) made pre-GSPA payments to Nigerian officials, or whether the GSPA had been procured by corruption, and so (c) there is no reason why Mr Quinn would have said anything about any such payments in his evidence. The argument is met at least by the point that the representation was express, and did not say nothing. I do not need to address Nigeria’s additional answer that continued silence during the arbitration was a breach of positive obligations said to be imposed by Nigerian law requiring the existence of the bribes to  be disclosed “by both the bribers and bribees”: see section 23 of the Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Act 2010.</p>

From the Statement of Case, [P&amp;ID] have arrived at this figure by estimating the profits they would have earned from the project over 20 years. As you know, this is not the correct measure of damages as [P&amp;ID] are required under the law to mitigate their loss, e.g. by investing in other projects with the funds they claim to have set aside for the project, and cannot validly make a claim for 20 years of profits. To strengthen this defence, we intend to engage a renowned, internationally recognised expert, with a lot of credibility, … to provide an expert witness. The expert witness would review the basis for [P&amp;ID’s] claim, provide an alternative and more realistic measure of loss that is consistent with [P&amp;ID’s] obligation to mitigate their loss and testify for [the Ministry] at the Arbitral Tribunal if it becomes necessary.</p>

                    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">In our view, the proposal of $1.5 billion made by P&amp;ID is within the range which that could have been awarded by the Arbitral Tribunal if [the Ministry of Petroleum Resources] had contested at the least the quantum of damages claimed by P&amp;ID. To that extent, it is a reasonable offer.</p>

                    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">However the team believes that even though P&amp;ID stated that the proposal is their final offer, there is room to reduce it further. An amicable settlement would increase P&amp;ID's chances of the amount of settlement being paid within a reasonable time as opposed to there having to try to enforce a judgement against government. There are many potential impediments to such enforcement so P and ID is in a much better position if both sides reach an amicable settlement.</p>

                    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">In our view the advantage of an amicable settlement over trying to enforce a contentious judgement, with the possibility of [the Ministry of Petroleum Resources] seeking to set aside the arbitral award, is a good reason to seek a further reduction from P&amp;ID.</p>

But the contract "remains alive for the awarding of damages either for previous breaches or for the breach which constitutes the repudiation." Thus any obligations which P&amp;ID had to buy the site, build the GPFs, etc. came to an end when the repudiation was accepted. There is no claim that either party committed any breach before the Government's repudiation.

Article 3(c) said that the Government was to deliver the gas at “the Site Boundary”. The “Site” was defined as “the land at Calabar on which the GPFs are located”. Mr Shasore says that the Government could not have complied with this obligation until P&amp;ID had a site. It had, it is true, been allocated and offered a site but had not yet bought it. So there was no possibility of compliance with an obligation to deliver to the Site boundary until P&amp;ID has a Site.</p>

Of course the Government could not actually deliver gas until there was a Site and, as we have said, until there was a plant to receive it. But that does not excuse the Government’s failure to comply with 6 b). There is no suggestion that its failure to comply with those obligations was caused by uncertainty as to where the Site was going to be. It was assumed by everyone that it would be on the land allocated in Calabar.”</p>

In England, before the Commercial Court, its application was to set aside the Award on Liability under section 68(2)(d) and (f) of the Arbitration Act 1996. These provisions are set out in full in the Annex; they refer to “failure by the tribunal to deal with all the issues that were put to it” and “uncertainty or ambiguity as to the effect of the award”.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The grounds may be summarised as follows. First, that there was an internal inconsistency on whether there was a breach of the obligation to deliver gas under Article 6(a) or only a breach of the obligation to ensure that all necessary pipelines and associated infrastructures were in place under Article 6(b). Second, that a defence of actual (factual) authority had not been dealt with or distinctly dealt with in addition to a defence of legal capacity. Third, that the question whether if there was a breach, it was repudiatory, was not considered or sufficiently considered or reasoned where there was a breach of Article 6(b) alone: here it was contended that where there was no obligation on Nigeria to deliver gas until P&amp;ID had built the plant to receive it, the failure by Nigeria to build infrastructure did not deprive P&amp;ID of its bargain unless and until it built the plant “which it never did”.  </p>

On 10 February 2016 Phillips J (as he then was) as a Judge of the English Commercial Court dealt with the extension of time as a preliminary issue.

Respectfully, I take a different view, and that is to say that the claimant has woefully failed to clear the first and important hurdle, that it was in the position to make a profit as at the time of the breach. The review of the experts' reports, my Lord, is based on the assumption that the event had happened to entitle the claimant to have damages naturally flowing from the event of the breach, which is after the signing of the GSPA. The question is, has anything happened after that to entitle the claimant to expect such huge amounts in profit? My Lord, at this point, going back to the GSPA, and this is without prejudice to - we cannot even refer to the liability hearing, that is done. The claimant was not even in the position to make any revenue, not to talk of profit, and that was part of my earlier submission with regards to the first step, acquisition of land, not to mention the building of the plant and other things. My learned friend referred to the warranty in the agreement as to obligations of the government and all that. My Lord –</p>

As against that income, it would have had to finance the necessary capital expenditure to acquire the site and construct the gas processing facilities ("CAPEX") and incur revenue expenditure in operating the plant (“OPEX”). The loss is therefore the value of the stream of net profit which P&amp;ID would have made if the Government had performed the contract according to its terms. As the damages have to be assessed once and for all, it is necessary to estimate the value of that stream of profit at the time of the breach, making an appropriate discount for the fact that P&amp;ID will be awarded immediate payment in place of sums which would actually have been received over a 20 year period. The Tribunal will in due course consider whether the valuation at the date of breach may take into account what is known to have happened since that date.”</p>

Mr Wolf, said the majority, “was not cross-examined on this part of his evidence” and the Upstream Report “made no comments upon any of the six individual heads of expenditure”.

There is no suggestion of what this other investment would have been. Nor is there any explanation of why, if found, this would have mitigated the loss caused by repudiation of the GSPA. Even if P&amp;ID could have found some other unspecified investment opportunity, there is no reason why this should be treated as mitigation of its loss. An employee who is dismissed can mitigate his loss by finding another full time job. But there is no reason why P&amp;ID should not have pursued more than one investment opportunity. The burden of proving that loss could have been mitigated is upon the party who has broken its contract: see <span style="font-style:italic">Roper v Johnson</span> {1873) LR 8 CP 167; <span style="font-style:italic">Geest plc v.

Of course it is understandable that the Tribunal should manage the Arbitration firmly in response. But at the quantum stage these points among others illustrate how unsatisfactory things were:</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.12in">Nigeria’s expert witnesses, Upstream, did not, in the view of the Tribunal, appear to have been shown Mr Michael Quinn's evidence: see [369] above. Further it was the fact, known to the Tribunal and of course the fault of Nigeria, that Upstream had had very little time to prepare written reports in a case of this enormous possible damages award. But part of their function as independent experts was to assist the Tribunal and time must have compromised their ability to provide that assistance: see [373], [375], [376], [379], [381], [386], [387], [389] and [395] above.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.12in">It was, respectfully, clear that Nigeria’s Leading Counsel, Chief Ayorinde SAN did not understand what the Tribunal was putting to him; this is not through any lack of clarity on the part of the Tribunal: see [354], [356], [359], [360] and [363]-[364] above. Leading the case for Nigeria, time and again matters were not put by him to P&amp;ID’s experts, with major consequences on key issues as the majority decision shows: see [373], [375], [376], [380], [384], [385] and [386] above. The air of unreality is compounded by a “statement of fees” appearing to bear the signature of Chief Ayorinde SAN and billing Naira 200 million for “Quantum of damages hearing” and US $197.5 million for “negotiation of arbitral award”.</p>

              <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1in;text-indent:0.12in">There does not seem to have been argument, and consideration of argument, whether over 20 years profitability might deteriorate for reasons not concerned with Nigeria’s compliance with its obligations, for example a hardening adverse position for gas in the context of a developing global response to climate change. Or (save perhaps at [395] above, which again contains points of law and fact that Nigeria did not test; note also [372] above) of the possibility that P&amp;ID might at least in time have devoted profitably elsewhere the time and energies it would otherwise have had to devote here. These might test conventional legal opinion, and be unsuccessful, but they were not attempted where so much turned on it for both parties. The common law in relation to prospective loss after repudiation continues to be found or developed: see by way of relatively recent example <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Flame SA v Glory Wealth Shipping PTE</span> [2013] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 653; [2013] EWHC 3153 (Comm) (Teare J).

Nigeria found its own (unsuccessful) argument on discount rate rebounding on it, rather than a closer analysis being pressed for. Billions of dollars would turn on this. There was no attempt to test the conventional idea of “what P&amp;ID would have had to pay to borrow the money or could have earned by investment in Nigeria” when dealing with sums so vast that in no real circumstance would P&amp;ID be borrowing them or would have invested them in Nigeria.</p>

The figure was three times higher by the time of the Awards. Of course these uplifts can happen, and the case is decided on the evidence, but the point adds to concern. Further, and although the Tribunal was not to know, no-one within the parties believed in a figure anywhere near US$6 billion as they discussed settlement: the drop to US$850 million was particularly rapid: see [281]-[292] above.</p>

They were “to keep her ‘on-side’, and to buy her silence about the earlier bribery” and to suppress “the fact that the contract had been passed through with no [proper] scrutiny”; “to keep their secrets” as Mr Howard KC put it. I reject P&amp;ID’s case that it did not make any payments during the Arbitration with the intention of “suppressing” anything, and that the payments were for legitimate reasons.</p>

Nothing I heard at trial, including from him, satisfied me on the question of what Mr Kuchazi had done to earn that level of reward. Nigeria alleged that he “exercised his influence” over officials to procure the conclusion of the GSPA, but I have little to show improper influence.</p>

But on the material before me this was not proved to my satisfaction. On 2 July 2014 P&amp;ID entered a “Settlement Brokerage Agreement” appointing Mr Adebayo as a representative in settlement negotiations. The potential rewards were enormous, entitling him to a share of any settlement proceeds up to a maximum of 50% of any agreed settlement sum greater than US$1 billion. This seems to have been replaced by an “internal Advisory Agreement” in August 2016 entitling Mr Adebayo to up to 20% of settlement proceeds. Under a Deed of Variation to a Share Sale Agreement dated 2017 Castleknock Holdings Limited, a company beneficially owned by Mr Cahill, Mr Andrew and Mr Burke KC, promised to pay 10% of the distributions received by Lismore Capital Limited in its capacity as legal owner of shares in P&amp;ID, net of applicable costs and commitments, to Mr Adebayo.</p>

On the other hand, the account given in this judgment shows that responsibility for failures to obtain evidence and to avoid delay lay rather with many ministers and officials, whom Mr Shasore SAN and others (including Stephenson Harwood and Mr Cordara QC at one stage) pressed repeatedly.</p>

This figure was concocted without any serious attempt to value P&amp;ID’s claim. Both Mr Cahill and Mr Andrew said in cross-examination that it was inconceivable that a settlement at that level could have been achieved, certainly before any finding on liability, yet Mr Adebayo almost managed it, with Ms Adelore, Mr Shasore and Mr Oguine recommending (in privileged advice improperly shared immediately in draft with P&amp;ID on 28 November 2014) that [Nigeria] pay that sum. They were stymied only by the President refusing to sign-off on the proposed settlement in late May 2015. It is no coincidence that huge amounts of cash were withdrawn by Mr Adebayo, and deposited by Ms Adelore and Mr Shasore, over the same period.”</p>

On 13 September 2019 Mr Oguine gave a statement in which he said that he received US$100,000 from Mr Shasore SAN. This was said to be by way of a loan although no part of it had been repaid. On 6 and 7 May 2020 Ms Adelore stated in an EFCC interview that she received an unsolicited payment of US$100,000 from Mr Shasore SAN.</p>

The majority are not in that category and there is no evidence to satisfy me that their release to and retention by P&amp;ID was authorised. The fact that it is not reliably known who procured them from Nigeria’s government offices or those of Twenty Marina is not essential for the purposes of my decision.</p>

In a witness statement that was before Sir Ross Cranston  in these proceedings, Mr Tijani set out a recollection that in early April 2009 that he attended a dinner with Mr Michael Quinn and Mr Hitchcock at the “Chopsticks” restaurant in Abuja and was given a US$50,000 cash 'gift' by Mr Hitchcock, placed in a black bag in his car.  He recalled he was later told by Mr Hitchcock that P&amp;ID would take care of him further at a later date and that they had made gifts to some other officials at the Ministry. There was also an allegation that he overlooked shortcomings in P&amp;ID’s bid.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Mr Tijani’s account of the “black bag” gift is disputed by P&amp;ID. I am not prepared to rely on it. I am concerned it cannot be tested satisfactorily, although Mr Howard KC did his formidable best to do so through other witnesses. The allegation was first made ten years later, on 12 January 2020. Mr Tijani was interviewed by the EFCC about it. He then made a witness statement in these proceedings on 5 June 2020 in which he said the “gift” in the black bag was made, but I am reluctant simply to accept this, without more. The timing is not straightforward to understand: P&amp;ID was reasonably positioned in April 2009 without the need for this particular payment then. In his witness statement Mr Tijani offered, unconvincingly, the explanation that he “consider[ed] that Mr Quinn and Mr Hitchcock just wanted to be friends with me”. There is no real background detail to this particular alleged payment. The method of payment differs from what is known about bribes or alleged bribes to others, including where alleged to have been in cash. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">Then there was what was known as the Bonga Audit, an episode that in my view is not fully revealed on the available evidence, but is in some respects explicable in terms of reward for later and separate services rendered. Mr Tijani addresses it in his witness statement, and following interview by the EFCC, but I am again cautious about that witness statement. It is not disputed that there was an investigation into delays and overspends on an offshore production unit and that these were to be examined by engineers. On 4 March 2013, Mr Michael Quinn contacted Mr Tijani (by then retired from the Ministry) to discuss this, and there was an email from Mr Hitchcock. Mr Tijani forwarded the email to two business associates, explaining that it had been received from “one of the guys that I assisted over the years when I was technical adviser to the Petroleum Minister”. On 1 June 2013 a contract to supply engineers was executed by Lurgi Consult (an ICIL group company, directed by Mr Adam Quinn and Mr Nolan) with Conserve Oil. The owner of Conserve Oil was a childhood friend of Mr Tijani. Mr Tijani’s wife became a director of Conserve Oil in June 2015 and Mr Tijani was appointed a signatory to the company’s bank account around March 2016. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">There are other episodes alleged but these do not take me much further, individually or cumulatively. Mr Tijani later sent on 17 December 2009 to Mr Hitchcock an email attaching the CVs of two associates and stating “I will appreciate your assistance for employment of any of the two ladies”. On 12 August 2013, the retired Mr Tijani offered his assistance to Mr Cahill and Michael Quinn in their attempts to enforce a 2004 arbitration award against NNPC and in favour of IPCO (Nigeria) Limited. In 2014 and 2015 Lurgi Consult made large contributions to the costs of the weddings of Mr Tijani’s son and daughter. This may not have been appropriate, but it was in 2014 and I am not satisfied it was related to the GSPA.</p>

That position is not a complete answer in my view. For example P&amp;ID referred to Mr Ajumogobia SAN, the Minister of State for Petroleum Resources at the time of the GSPA. There appears to be a question between the parties whether he may have seen an advanced draft of the GSPA. It would have been helpful to have had evidence from someone in a position of seniority, and not the subject of allegations from Nigeria, but there is no basis for an adverse inference in my view.</p>

He has been involved since. Nigeria did not tender Mr Malami SAN as a witness for cross examination. P&amp;ID contend that the decision by Nigeria not to call any witness who could be cross examined was “motivated by a wish to ensure that its officials … should not be exposed to questioning which would show them in a negative light.”</p>

Nigeria’s position is that Mr Malami SAN was only involved from the quantum stage of the arbitration and could therefore only give first-hand evidence from that point onwards. Mr Malami SAN could not have given any relevant evidence, says Nigeria. P&amp;ID’s closing contends that had Mr Malami SAN or any other representatives of Nigeria been prepared to attend Court to support the serious allegations they saw fit to make, P&amp;ID would have been able to question them about a range of relevant matters including 14 that it lists.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The objection under consideration in section 68(2)(g), that of “the award being obtained by fraud or the award or the way in which it was procured being contrary to public policy”, is of fundamental character to the arbitration process because it goes to the integrity of that process. No policy of arbitration law calls for section 68(2)(g) to be given other than its plain meaning. An award obtained by fraud or contrary to public policy (or procured in a way that was contrary to public policy) and which has caused or will cause substantial injustice is not what the parties agreed to when they agreed on arbitration. To support it in the name of supporting arbitration as a process achieves the opposite. Unless the right to object is lost for reasons of finality (the business of section 73, below), and subject to the procedural restrictions in section 70(2) and (3), there is no sanctuary. This architecture meets the requirements of justice.</p>

Further, the revelation of the bribery would also have shown that the GSPA had been procured through lies told by P&amp;ID about to its ability and willingness to perform the contract and  that the contract was instead passed through without any due diligence. These points too are directed to the contract not the Award. </p>

Nigeria has characterised the GSPA as a sham and contended that P&amp;ID as a BVI-registered company with no obvious assets, no relevant experience and few employees, had no genuine intention of performing the GSPA, and would never have been able to do so. However P&amp;ID did not have to contemplate performing the GSPA itself with its assets, experience and employees. This is not, as it represented, because it could simply use the work on Project Alpha to perform the GSPA. It is rather because ICIL Group had shown in the past that they could contract in. </p>

Consistently, P&amp;ID did not use the GSPA to move directly to arbitration at the first available opportunity. I have found it did not (as alleged by Nigeria) corrupt Mr Shasore SAN. And it appointed, in Sir Anthony Evans, an arbitrator of unquestioned experience, expertise and independence.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first is P&amp;ID’s providing to the Tribunal and relying on evidence before the Tribunal that was material but was evidence that P&amp;ID knew to be false. Specifically, this was the evidence of Mr Michael Quinn in his witness statement of 14 February 2014 that he was “explain[ing] how the GSPA came about” when he did not do that because he did not mention that Mrs Grace Taiga had been paid a US$5,000 bribe at the end of December 2009 and a £5,000 bribe on 29 March 2010: see [168]-177], [247]-[254] and [417] above).</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second is P&amp;ID’s continued bribery or corrupt payment of Mrs Grace Taiga directed to the arbitration period in order to suppress from the Tribunal and Nigeria the fact that she had been bribed when the GSPA came about. This continued bribery or corrupt payment is fairly described by Nigeria as bribery “to keep her ‘on-side’, and to buy her silence about the earlier bribery”. Specifically, these were bribes or corrupt payments on 14 July, 14 August and 30 September 2015 totalling NGN 220,000 (then equivalent to US$900), a bribe or corrupt payment on 14 September 2015 of US$1,000 and a bribe or corrupt payment on 14 June 2016 of US$3,000 (sent to Vera Taiga): see [401]-[405] above. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third is P&amp;ID’s improper retention of Nigeria’s Internal Legal Documents that it had received during the Arbitration. It retained these (rather than returned them unread) so as to monitor Nigeria’s position and awareness as the Arbitration continued. This included monitoring whether Nigeria had become aware of the deception being practised by P&amp;ID on the Tribunal and on Nigeria as a party before the Tribunal. Specifically, there was a flow of over 40 of Nigeria’s Internal Legal Documents to P&amp;ID during the period of the Arbitration from commencement on 22 August 2012 to Final Award on 31 January 2017. The detail of the contents of a number of them is discussed above. All are material, including for the fact that they showed to P&amp;ID that Nigeria had no awareness that Mrs Grace Taiga had been bribed when the GSPA came about and that bribery or corrupt payments continued to buy her silence. </p>

But it is these three things that are central to Nigeria’s challenge under section 68. They do not, it will be noted, include separately Mr Quinn’s evidence about finance and engineering, but that is because those areas face the difficulty (brought out by Lord Wolfson KC particularly in his argument under section 73, made at the trial) that Mr Quinn’s evidence on them was, to some extent, already challenged or the subject of attempts at challenge in the Arbitration, including by Mr Shasore SAN at the hearing on liability. It was Nigeria’s own case in the Arbitration, including at the hearing on quantum, that P&amp;ID had done nothing under the GSPA. </p>

                    <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.21in">As was explained in the 1996 <span style="font-style:italic">Report on the Arbitration Bill</span> (which became the 1996 Act) of the Departmental Advisory Committee on Arbitration Law (“the DAC”), the test of serious irregularity was intended to limit intervention to “extreme” cases where it could be said that “the tribunal has gone so wrong in its conduct of the arbitration that justice calls out for it to be corrected”. As set out at para 280 of the DAC Report:</p>

                      <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:1.18in;text-indent:0.32in">Irregularities stand on a different footing. Here we consider that it is appropriate, indeed essential, that these have to pass the test of causing ‘substantial injustice’ before the court can act. The court does not have a general supervisory jurisdiction over arbitrations. We have listed the specific cases where a challenge can be made under this Clause. The test of ‘substantial injustice’ is intended to be applied by way of support for the arbitral process, not by way of interference with that process. Thus it is only in those cases where it can be said that <span style="font-style:italic">what has happened is so far removed from what could reasonably be expected of the arbitral process that we would expect the court to take action</span>. The test is not what would have happened had the matter been litigated. To apply such a test would be to ignore the fact that the parties have agreed to arbitrate, not litigate. Having chosen arbitration, the parties cannot validly complain of substantial injustice unless what has happened simply cannot on any view be defended as an acceptable consequence of that choice. In short, Clause 68 is really designed as <span style="font-style:italic">a long stop</span>, only available in <span style="font-style:italic">extreme cases where the tribunal has gone so wrong in its conduct of the arbitration that justice calls out for it to be corrected</span>.” (Emphasis added)”</p>

In my judgment, it is one of the ways in which the requirement for causation may be and has been put, but it is and has not been intended as a comprehensive description. Section 68(2)(g) says simply that it is “substantial injustice to the applicant” that has to be shown. And this is substantial injustice that the serious irregularity “has caused or will cause”.  I should add that I do not consider that the relevant paragraph in Nigeria’s written opening does quite create common ground as suggested.  </p>

Rather, as we have seen, the effect of the Privy Council advice is that a case within section 68(2)(a) will not constitute a serious irregularity unless the court considers that it has caused substantial injustice, although the nature of the irregularity may be such that the inference of substantial injustice almost goes without saying. Moreover, there will be no substantial injustice if it can be shown that the outcome of the arbitration would have been the same regardless of the irregularity.”  </p>

But Sir Ross made clear he was dealing with the situation where the serious irregularity was apparent bias (and apparent bias not actual bias). If it can be shown that the outcome of the arbitration would have been the same regardless of apparent bias then it seems clear that there will be no substantial injustice. That is what Sir Ross was saying, and in my respectful view he was correct. </p>

Perhaps there is much to be said for this aspect of these challenges to be left with the words of the section “serious irregularity means an irregularity of one or more of the following kinds which the court considers has caused or will cause substantial injustice to the applicant”, keeping in mind the text of the DAC report to which the Privy Council referred. </p>

It is the fact of that bribery that Mr Michael Quinn falsely concealed by the words of his witness statement, and that the continued bribery or corrupt payments sought to suppress.

I respectfully disagree. The Awards were the result of the Arbitration that happened. There is no question to my mind that the Arbitration would have been completely different, and in ways strongly favourable to Nigeria, had the fact of bribery of Mrs Grace Taiga when the GSPA was being made been before the Tribunal. It would have brought in the issue whether the GSPA was procured by fraud, and as a result voidable. Discovery of the concealment would have completely altered the Tribunal’s approach to the rest of Mr Michael Quinn’s evidence. </p>

I must again respectfully reject the argument. The Court will be realistic here about what proof is possible in terms of showing the effect of a dishonest course of conduct. The nature and contents of the documents, and the scale, continuity and circumstances of P&amp;ID’s conduct were such that, in my judgment, Nigeria’s right to confidential access to legal advice was utterly compromised throughout all or most of the Arbitration. It was effectively denied an important part of the process of arbitration. Here too I have no doubt that had the Tribunal known, its approach would have been very different.</p>

The Court of Appeal considered an appeal against a judgment at trial. It examined whether the purchase of stolen privileged documents had given “any significant procedural advantage” at the trial, finding that it had not; the documents had not been used “to obtain a tactical advantage in the litigation, let alone [had they] enabled him to obtain a favourable verdict when otherwise he might not have done so”.</p>

On the appeal the court examined the effect of specific identified use of privileged documents at a trial. It was realistically possible to enquire into the question of tactical advantage and effect on verdict. Here the court on a section 68 application is faced with conduct throughout the course of an arbitration. There are limits to the feasibility and reliability of an attempt to capture the advantages enjoyed in the latter situation and how those may or will have affected the conduct of the arbitration and as a result the outcome of the arbitration.</p>

The focus here is on the process by which an award was achieved. Approached with the extreme caution mentioned by Moore-Bick J in Cuflet Chartering (above), the language of the section in my judgment applies where (as here) Nigeria was comprehensively deprived of its right to legal professional privilege throughout the process.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">I reach these views of the matter without reluctance. P&amp;ID has the Awards only after and by practising the most severe abuses of the arbitral process. As a result Nigeria had a “right to object” under section 68(2)(g) of the Arbitration Act 1996. True, there were other causes of the Awards, including incompetence and neglect throughout the Arbitration on the part of Nigeria (acting through a number of individuals). But the presence of these causes does not detract from the effects of P&amp;ID’s abusive conduct. If this was a fight it was not a fair one, and could not lead to a just result.</p>

Where fraud has been raised at the original trial and new evidence as to the existence of the fraud is prayed in aid to advance a case for setting aside the judgment, it seems to me that it can be argued that the court having to deal with that application should have a discretion as to whether to entertain the application. .... The second relates to the possibility that, in some circumstances, a deliberate decision may have been taken not to investigate the possibility of fraud in advance of the first trial, even if that had been suspected. If that could be established, again, I believe that a discretion whether to allow an application to set aside the judgment would be appropriate but, once more, I express no final view on the question."</p>

It is a fundamental principle of our law that, as Lord Bingham said in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">HIH Casualty and General Insurance Ltd v Chase Manhattan Bank</span> [2003] UKHL 6, [2003] 2 Lloyd's Rep 61 - referring to what Rix LJ had said in the Court of Appeal - that fraud is a thing apart, it unravels all: [15]. There seems to be no reason why the finality of arbitration awards should be afforded greater importance than the finality of judgments in circumstances of fraud. The statutory bar in section 73 is limited to irregularities discoverable during the arbitration. Otherwise, the effect of section 81(1) of the [Arbitration] Act [1996] is to preserve the right to challenge the enforcement of an award on public policy grounds under the common law. As Mr Howard contended, there is no reason to interpret the Act so that <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Takhar</span> is confined to common law public policy challenges and not to those under section 68(2)(g).”</p>

When Nigeria says in its written opening: “In this respect, the test is not whether Nigeria’s legal team could by any means have discovered P&amp;ID’s dishonesty, but whether it should have done so”, the test does not involve the word “should” but the test also does not include the words “any means”.

As Lord Bingham observed in the former case, it is “wrong to hold that because a matter could have been raised in earlier proceedings it should have been, so as to render the raising of it in later proceedings necessarily abusive.” The “should” in this formulation refers to something which the law would expect a reasonable person to do in his own interest and in that of the efficient conduct of litigation. However, the basis on which the law unmakes transactions, including judgments, which have been procured by fraud is that a reasonable person is entitled to assume honesty in those with whom he deals. He is not expected to conduct himself or his affairs on the footing that other persons are dishonest unless he knows that they are. That is why it is not a defence to an action in deceit to say that the victim of the deceit was foolish or negligent to allow himself to be taken in: <span style="font-style:italic">Central Railway Company of Venezuela v Kisch</span> (1867) LR 2 HL 99, 120 (Lord Chelmsford); <span style="font-style:italic">Redgrave v Hurd</span> (1881) 20 Ch D 1, 13-17 (Jessell MR).

In this judgment, I have rejected Nigeria’s case that Mr Shasore SAN and other members of Nigeria’s legal team have been shown have been corrupted.</p>

It is the presence of the inconsistency that may start to prompt the discovery of fraud in the former case, but in the latter case there is no equivalent until something happens to cause the concealment to start to break down. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The first “red flag” coupled two parts. The first part was the contention that the GSPA was “a contract which was, on its face, deeply suspicious”. The second was the fact that the GSPA was entered into with a British Virgin Islands company “with no apparent assets, no obvious industry experience, and no other credentials to suggest that it would be suitable to operate such a sophisticated arrangement”, and where government business was generally conducted through a local Nigerian company. </p>

However P&amp;ID has itself shown the similarity of the GSPA with other contracts under the Advanced Gas Development Project (and see [155] above). It is of note that, notwithstanding the points I have mentioned in this judgment, the GSPA did not strike the Tribunal as, on its face, “deeply suspicious”. But I appreciate that part of P&amp;ID’s emphasis is that Mr Malami (who was appointed in November 2015 and thus in the period of the Arbitration) was saying it was suspicious to him.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">As to the second part of the first “red flag”, Nigeria had had plenty of experience of working with ICIL Group companies. The track record showed that ICIL Group would bring experience and expertise in when needed, and Nigerian entities, including P&amp;ID (Nigeria), were there if required. There is not enough in the first “red flag” to suggest bribery. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The second suggested “red flag” was the widespread presence of corruption in Nigeria, described by Mr Malami SAN, including in the oil and gas industry and at the time the GSPA was entered into. This is not enough to suggest bribery in every individual case or in this case. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The third “red flag” was the failure to meet procurement procedures, or authorisation procedures. This is not a strong point in this case in the light of P&amp;ID’s emphasis on bureaucratic and procedural incompetence, and the position with other contracts under the Accelerated Gas Development Project. Mr Malami informed the English Court in December 2019 that certain authorisation procedures “were required by law with a view to, amongst other things, combatting corruption”. Again that is not enough to suggest bribery in every case in which they were not complied with or in this case.</p>

The transcript of the hearing before the Tribunal on liability shows that Mr Shasore SAN also said that “Mr Quinn, in particular, felt they could get what they wanted because their friends in government would make it happen.” As is fairly accepted in P&amp;ID’s closing argument these words are capable of a number of meanings. I do not consider it is reasonable to spell the beginnings of an allegation of bribery out of them, and there is no evidence that anyone who heard them did.</p>

It is, by reference to my findings in this judgment, not accurate on some of the subjects but part of P&amp;ID’s point is that Nigeria saw these things in this way. But even then, I do not accept that these subjects and Nigeria’s view of them required it, as a matter of reasonable diligence, to investigate for bribery.   </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The fourth and fifth “red flags” were in February 2016, when Stephenson Harwood advised an investigation by “a credible investigations company” into “P&amp;IDs history, its financial capabilities and general track record” and Mr Shasore SAN advised Dr Kachikwu and Mrs Adelore that FRN should be “investigating the manner in which P&amp;ID came to be selected to perform the GSPA in order to determine if there are any illegality or public policy reasons why it should not be awarded damages”. In fact there was the appointment of the EFCC in February 2016 to investigate, and this found a number of things but not bribes. Part of P&amp;ID’s argument, pressed by Mr Wolfson KC, is that given the points in its summary at [551] or assembled at [552] above (or the first three “red flags”) this all could have happened in 2012 rather than 2016.</p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">But even 2016 is within the period of the Arbitration, and thus relevant to section 73. The EFCC recommended in June 2016 (“red flag” six), after what it termed an “interim” investigation “a further detailed investigation into the circumstances surrounding the award of the contract and the key parties to the transaction”. That development does not in itself take things further in relation to bribes. P&amp;ID points out that writing in February 2016 about its investigation, the EFCC said it was investigating what it described as “a case of Conspiracy, Abuse of Office and Misappropriation of Public Funds”, but at that point that was not (I consider, doing the best I can with incomplete materials) an accurate description of what it was looking at, or what Stephenson Harwood or Mr Shasore SAN had advised.</p>

Nor, even if I take them together, do I consider that the points show that reasonable diligence required Nigeria to look for bribery in this case. There were many other things, specifically identified, to look into. Lord Wolfson KC in closing was strong in his criticism of Nigeria for not taking steps that were recommended, but what matters is whether reasonable diligence required Nigeria to look for bribery whilst dishonest evidence further concealed it.</p>

It did not have that awareness and Mr Michael Quinn, Mr Cahill and P&amp;ID were not going to reveal the truth. Indeed they were bribing or making corrupt payments to keep the truth concealed and (through retention of Nigeria’s Internal Legal Documents) monitoring Nigeria’s awareness of the truth.</p>

These showed some reference to some pre-GSPA payments. Respectfully, even if sufficient foundation for an order for disclosure could have been established in the arbitration, I do not accept that the documents suggested would have been disclosed. Throughout the Arbitration P&amp;ID was maintaining the false position originally represented by Mr Michael Quinn on its behalf that what he had said in his witness statement explained how the GSPA came about. </p>

In doing so it again uses against Mr Malami SAN that which he pressed in favour of Nigeria in 2019. P&amp;ID does so by saying that reasonable diligence required the further steps to be taken earlier. The further steps include obtaining the P&amp;ID case file from the Ministry of Petroleum Resources, looking into due diligence and procurement procedures, budgetary provision and operating licence, asking other departments and oil and gas companies about Mr Quinn and P&amp;ID and exploring the roles of Dr Lukman, Mr Ajumogobia, Mrs Grace Taiga and Mr Tijani. In the case of Mrs Grace Taiga this was because she witnessed the GSPA and public procurement procedures had not been followed. </p>

I am also unpersuaded that an interview with Ms Taiga before 2019 would have revealed then what was revealed by her statement in 2019.

But I end the case acutely conscious of how readily the outcome could have been different, and of the enormous resources ultimately required from Nigeria as the successful party to make good its challenge. I highlight the possible consequences if Mr Andrew had drafted Mr Michael Quinn’s witness statement a little more cautiously and if P&amp;ID had not retained Nigeria’s Internal Legal Documents during the Arbitration.</p>

Many reading this judgment will recognise that, although in the present case bribery and corruption were behind that imbalance, it happens in other cases without bribery and corruption but simply where experience, expertise or resources are grossly unequal. This underlines the importance of professional standards and ethics in the work of contract drafting, including in the approach to other parties to the proposed contract. It is why some contributions of pro bono work by leading law firms to support some states challenged for resources (this is not to say, one way or the other, that Nigeria is one of those) is so valuable, in the interests of their, often vulnerable, people. In the present case there were other contracts too, with different counterparties. Their terms and circumstances are not identical, but the overall risk could have been a multiple of the US$11 billion now involved in the present case.  </p>

But the case has shown examples where legal representatives did not do their work to the standard needed, where experts failed to do their work, and where politicians and civil servants failed to ensure that Nigeria as a state participated properly in the Arbitration. The result was that the Tribunal did not have the assistance that it was entitled to expect, and which makes the arbitration process work. And Nigeria did not in the event properly consider, select and attempt admittedly difficult legal and factual arguments that the circumstances likely required. Even without the dishonest behaviour of P&amp;ID, Nigeria was compromised. </p>

The Tribunal in the present case allowed time where it felt it could and applied pressure where it felt it should. Perhaps some encouragement to better engagement can be seen as well. Yet there was not a fair fight. And the Tribunal took a very traditional approach. But was the Tribunal stuck with what parties did or did not appear to bring forward? Could and should the Tribunal have been more direct and interventionist when it was so clear throughout the Arbitration that Nigeria’s lawyers were not getting instructions, or when at the quantum hearing Nigeria’s then Leading Counsel, Chief Ayorinde, was failing to put necessary points to experts to test their opinion and Nigeria’s own experts (for whatever reason) had not done the work required? Should the Tribunal have taken the initiative to encourage exploration of new bounds of contract law and the law of damages that may today be required where major long term contracts are involved?</p>

When courts are concerned it is often said that the “open court principle” helps keep judges up to the mark. But it also allows scrutiny of the process as a whole, and what the lawyers and other professionals are doing, and (where a state is involved) what the state is doing to address a dispute on behalf of its people. An open process allows the chance for the public and press to call out what is not right.</p>

But the case shows the danger of the latter happening. The situation was serious enough to cause Nigeria to allege that Mr Shasore SAN’s efforts were those of a Leading Counsel deliberately underperforming. I have found against the allegation in this case, but it was one responsibly made by Mr Howard KC and with his fully appreciating the professional responsibilities on him in making that allegation.</p>

That is just tough. You have made your arbitration bed and you lie on it”. Blunt and correct. But, unless accompanied by public visibility or greater scrutiny by arbitrators, how suitable is the process in a case such as this where what is at stake is public money amounting to a material percentage of a state’s GDP or budget? Is greater visibility in arbitrations involving a state or state owned entities part of the answer?</p>

The expertise and tenacity shown by Mishcon de Reya and Nigeria’s team of Counsel (Mr Howard KC, Mr Riches KC, Mr Ford, Mr Pascoe and Mr Mellab) has made the difference in getting to the facts, although some allegations were not made out. But I wish to mention in particular Quinn Emanuel and P&amp;ID’s team of Counsel (Lord Wolfson KC, Mr Milner KC, Mr Hoskins and Mr Evans). Their professionalism in ensuring that all points were properly and responsibly taken for their client in a difficult case, whilst at the same time ensuring both at and in advance of the trial that their duties to the court (especially as regards their clients’ disclosure of documents) were assiduously honoured, has my respect and profoundly deserves that of their client.</p>

Sir Ross Cranston has recently heard his last case in the High Court of England &amp; Wales, although he remains fully involved in the legal system, here and overseas, in other significant roles. The facts and argument presented across the 8 week trial before me were in material respects different and of course far more developed from those put before Sir Ross at the interim hearing in July 2020. But that makes his decision and written judgment on that interim hearing the more impressive still for the acuity, independence, and courage involved. Without that decision and judgment an injustice would have remained, the population of an entire federation of states would have suffered from the economic consequences, and fundamental damage would have been left to the integrity of arbitration as a process.</p>
