They separated in 2017 while Z was still a baby. The mother then relocated with Z to this country. Since then the father has served a term of imprisonment in Slovakia following a conviction for fraud. Since the parents’ separation, Z has had no contact with her father and has no idea who he is. Z is now 8 years old.</p>

She directed that it was in Z’s welfare to be supported to understand her life story, and in particular to be supported to learn who her father is. It is to this end that the orders that are the subject of this application were made.</p>

I have concluded that the breaches are serious such that they meet the threshold for a term of committal. However, I have considered the various statutory guidance and authorities and in all the circumstances it is not appropriate for that penalty to be imposed in this case. Instead, I order the respondent to pay a fine of £250 to be paid in 14 days. </span></p>
