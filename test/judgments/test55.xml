The works of conversion associated with the proposed change of use may be minimal, in which case the CMP would only need to be minimal, however the works of conversion may be more extensive in which case the CMP would need to be more detailed and include specific noise and vibration limits.

At no point does the First Permission identify the “site” for the purpose of the expression “on-site” testing to mean the Studios. In any event, the Council was reasonably able to decide (as it did-see OR2, para 6.11) that information derived from testing within the Site as opposed to within the Studios, was sufficient to establish compliance with Condition 15. Further, the Council had the January 22 BV report in addition to those from August 2021 and March 2022, and the January 22 report undertook testing in the Studios. </p>

It said that had the Claimant sought to challenge the Second Permission, the claim would no doubt have been defended on the basis that it had been brought prematurely, because the question of the need for and nature of any appropriate protection for the Studios was to follow pursuant to submission of the CMP and application for discharge of Condition 6. </p>

The CMP set out in detail the noise mitigation measures that would be adopted. In the circumstances, the Defendant was entitled to conclude that the CMP provided enough detail and to rely on the CMP requirement that the limit set out in the CMP would be met.

While in every case, the allocation of costs will depend on the specific facts, there are some points which can be made about these different types of case. </span></p>

Whether pursuant to judgement following a contested hearing, or by virtue of a settlement, the claimant can, at least absent special circumstances, say that he has been vindicated and, as the successful party, that he should recover his costs. In the latter case, the defendants can no doubt say that they were realistic in settling, and should not be penalised in costs, but the answer to that point is that the defendants should, on that basis, have settled before the proceedings were issued: that is one of the main points of the pre-action protocols….</span></p>

Given that there will have been a hearing, the court will be in a reasonably good position to make findings on such questions. However, where there has been a settlement, the court will, at least normally, be in a significantly worse position to make findings on such issues than where the case has been fought out. In many such cases, the court will be able to form a view as to the appropriate costs order based on such issues; in other cases, it will be much more difficult. I would accept the argument that, where the parties have settled the claimant’s substantive claims on the basis that he succeeds in part, but only part, there is often much to be said for concluding that there is no order for costs….However, where there is not a clear winner, so much would depend on the particular facts. In some such cases, it may help to consider who would have won if the matter had proceeded to trial, as, if it is tolerably clear, it may, for instance support or undermine that one of the two claims was stronger than the other…</span></p>

In such cases, therefore, there is an even more powerful argument that the default position should be no order for costs. However, in some such cases, it may well be sensible to look at the underlying claims and inquire whether it was tolerably clear who would have won if the matter had not settled. If it is, then that may well strongly support the contention that the party who would have won did better out of the settlement, and therefore did win.”</span></p>

Planning officers’ reports to committee are not be read with undue rigour, but with reasonable benevolence, and bearing in mind that they are written      for councillors with local knowledge (see the judgment of Baroness Hale of Richmond in R (on the application of Morge) v Hampshire County Council [2011] UKSC 2, at paragraph 36, and       the judgment of Sullivan J, as he then was, in R v Mendip District Council, ex part Fabre (2000) 80 P &amp; CR 500, at p.509). Unless there is evidence to suggest otherwise, it may reasonably be assumed that, if the members followed the officer’s recommendation, they did so on the basis of the advice that he or she gave (see the judgment of Lewison LJ in Palmer v Herefordshire Council [2016] EWCA Civ 1061, at paragraph 7). The question for the court will always be whether, on a fair reading of the report as a whole, the officer has materially misled the members on a matter bearing upon their decision, and the error has gone uncorrected    before the decision was made. Minor or inconsequential errors may be excused. It is only if the advice in the officer’s report is such as to misdirect the members in a material way – so that, but for the flawed advice it was given, the committee’s decision would or might have been different – that the court will be able to conclude that the decision itself was rendered unlawful        by that advice.</span></p>

There will be cases in which a planning officer has inadvertently    led a committee astray by making some significant error of fact (see, for example R (on the application of Loader) v Rother District Council [2016] EWCA Civ 795), or has plainly misdirected the members as to the meaning of a relevant policy (see, for example, Watermead Parish Council v Aylesbury Vale District Council [2017] EWCA Civ 152). There will be others where the officer has simply failed to deal with a matter on which the committee ought to receive explicit advice if the local planning authority is to be seen to have performed its decision-making duties in accordance with the law (see, for example, R (on the application of Williams) v Powys County Council [2017] EWCA Civ 427). But unless there is some distinct       and material defect in the officer’s advice, the court will not interfere.”</span></p>

In paragraph 27 the Defendant is referring to what it understands to be the Claimant’s interpretation, namely that there has to be a guarantee that exceedances “could never occur.” I think the remaining paragraphs make clear that as the Officer told the Committee, it was not permitted to exceed the noise levels set out in condition 15, even though it could not be physically guaranteed that such exceedance would never take place. Paragraph 18 quotes the Officer in OR1 saying that the IP had to find a means of constructing the development in such a way that it would “not exceed the targets”, and paragraph 22 says that having shown how it intended to construct the development in accordance with the noise and vibration limits, thereafter it was required to “comply with the means of construction that it has identified as capable of meeting those limits”. Paragraph 28 in essence repeats those points. Further, because the Claimant’s Pre-Action Protocol letter focused on alleged deficiencies in OR2, I think it is also appropriate to interpret the Defendant’s Pre-Action Protocol response in the light of OR2, which as I say below did not mean that exceedances of the limits were permitted. </p>

Even read on its own, the sentence relied on by the Claimant (at OR6.11) does not suggest that meaning to me, but in any case, the sentence must be understood in the context of OR2 as a whole. The Officer explained the need for limits at 6.5, set out what Condition 15 required at 6.6 (ie that it should be shown “how construction can be carried out without exceeding the agreed noise and vibration levels”), referred to the submitted DCMP at 6.7, referred to testing results at 6.8 (as showing that the development could be carried out in accordance with the agreed levels) and at 6.9-6.10 discussed whether the limits in the Condition could be met. He also explained at 6.11 and 6.12 that if an exceedance did occur the applicant would need to take action to rectify the situation. That is why Condition 15 requires monitoring and liaison, so that if exceedances occur, they can be rectified. </p>

The officer’s advice was clear, and as the Court recognised in <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">Bishops Stortford Civic Federation v East Hertfordshire District Council</span>, the cut and thrust of political debate is not conducive to refined textual analysis. The Claimant complained about the Defendant’s legal adviser saying that the work “can” be carried out within the limits in Condition 15 as opposed to be “must.” I think that in the context this did not amount to a statement that might have misled the Committee into thinking that compliance with the limits was optional or that Condition 15 would not be breached if the limits were not complied with. The discussion at the meeting was mainly about whether there would be exceedances of the limits, and it is plain from the transcript that Members understood that if there were exceedances there would be “breaches” of the limits, meaning that enforcement action could be taken by the Defendant if work did not cease. </p>

Nowhere is it suggested that “the site” for the purpose of the expression “on-site” testing necessarily means testing inside the Studios themselves. As was submitted for the IP, conditions 8, 11, 12, 17 and 23 refer to “the site” in various contexts. In each case the condition is referring to the Site, not the Studios. It would be surprising if a condition were to require testing to take place within the Studios, as this is land in third-party control and as such a condition containing such a requirement could be considered unreasonable. </p>

BV’s position was that the recorded exceedances were within the reasonable margin for error. Vanguardia’s position (Mr Griffiths) was that the exceedances (of up to 2dB) should be considered leaving out of account the margin for error. This point was discussed at the Committee meeting, with the acoustic consultants for both the Claimant and IP setting out their position. </p>

The March 22 report tested further alternatives, in particular saw cutting and hand-held core drilling. This was also referred to in the Addendum Report.

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.33in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0.12in">Having regard to the review of the merits of JR1 and JR2 set out above, my overall view is that with the exception of the declaration sought in JR1, it is not tolerably clear that had these claims been litigated, the Claimant would have won. I am conscious that without a hearing my ability to assess the merits is limited. At a hearing the Claimant would no doubt wish to address the points I have made above in relation to the merits of the two claims. But that is not possible where parties choose to settle a case but leave costs to the Court. Inevitably, in that situation, the Court is in an imperfect position to judge who would have won. Acknowledging that imperfect position but doing the best I can on the basis of the written evidence and submissions, my view is that (save for the declaration) the Defendant, not the Claimant, would have won. </p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.33in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0.12in">Further, in relation to the declaration sought, I have concluded that the Defendant did not suggest an interpretation of Condition 15 which was incorrect or inconsistent with the position of the Claimant and as set out in the Settlement Agreement, even in its response to the Claimant’s pre-action protocol letter in relation to JR1. This is hardly surprising, because I do not think that the position as stated by the Officer in OR2 was incorrect, either. It follows that JR1 was unnecessary insofar as the claim for a declaration was concerned. </p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.33in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0.12in">I have noted that the Claimant made offers to settle JR1 following the issue of proceedings (see its Submissions on Costs at paragraphs 67-73) but that does not mean the Claimant should be awarded all or any of its costs of JR1, because in my judgement it was not necessary for the JR1 proceedings to be commenced in the first place in order to obtain the Defendant’s agreement to the Claimant’s position on the interpretation of Condition 15. I note that the Claimant’s letter to the Defendant of 18 July 2022 (sent after receipt of the Defendant’s Summary Grounds of Defence, which the Claimant accepted in that letter agreed with the Claimant’s interpretation of Condition 15) required the Defendant to bear the Claimant’s costs on the ground that it was clear that the interpretation offered in the Summary Grounds of Defence differed from that given in the Officer’s advice to Members and the Defendant’s Pre-Action Protocol response. I have not seen the Defendant’s reply to this letter, but it will be apparent from earlier sections of this judgement that I do not agree that there was such a difference.</p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.33in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0.12in">Also, even if the Defendant’s acceptance of the Claimant’s interpretation of Condition 15 had been made clear only in its Summary Grounds (and not in its Pre-Action Protocol response), it still would not have been right to make a costs order in favour of the Claimant, because after receipt of the Summary Grounds the Claimant continued with JR1, running up further costs and causing the Defendant to do so, in circumstances where it had already secured acceptance of its interpretation of Condition 15 and where I do not think it would have succeeded in relation to the rest of its claim. </p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.33in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0.12in">Having regard to my findings on the merits of JR2, I think the right decision would be for no order as to costs even if (contrary to my view) the Claimant could be said to have succeeded in part. This is a case where in the words of Lord Neuberger “there is…much to be said for concluding that there is no order as to costs.” Even if the Claimant secured some of what it sought, it has failed in relation to the rest. </p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.33in;margin-right:0.08in;text-indent:0.12in">Finally, in relation to JR2, even if (contrary to my view) it could be said that the Claimant did secure the relief it sought (in whole or part) by agreeing with the IP that Condition 15 of the First Permission would in effect be applied over to Condition 6 of the Second Permission, I think this would be a case as per <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R(Tesfay) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> and <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">R(MH) (Eritrea) v Secretary of State for the Home Department</span> (both cited above) where the Claimant obtained the relief it sought for reasons which are unrelated to the underlying merits of the claim. As set out above, I am not convinced that the Claimant would have succeeded in JR2, and it seems to me that insofar as it succeeded in securing the IP’s agreement to cross-apply condition 15 to the Second Permission, it did so as part of a commercial negotiation which did not reflect the merits of the JR2 claim.</p>
