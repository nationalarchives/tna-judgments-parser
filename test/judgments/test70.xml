The Commissioner nevertheless makes the following observations in respect of the Appellant’s grounds of appeal. The Appellant argues that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-size:11pt;color:#000000">“Sussex Police are continuing to ignore and are blatantly in disregard of their duty of care and protection to the public” </span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">and that </span><span style="font-size:11pt;color:#000000">“they are withholding vitally important information from us, which could cause death / injury or severe health problems”.</span><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000"> The Appellant then sets out the alleged aggressive behaviour of the individual who is the subject of the request towards the Appellant and his family for which he has made a complaint to Sussex Police.</span></p>

              <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.35in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">The Commissioner has accepted in the DN Paragraph [7] that there is some legitimate interest in the Police confirming or denying to the public under FOIA that the requested information is held relating to SP’s accountability in its disciplinary procedures and that it would allow the public to have confidence in or raise concerns about the standards the police expects of its officers.</span></p>

              <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.35in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">However, upon further reflection, the Commissioner questions whether confirmation or denial to the public under FOIA that the requested information was held was necessary to meet such a legitimate interest as it would simply confirm or deny whether any disciplinary action had been taken against the individual in the past. Nevertheless, even if it could be established that it was necessary to confirm or deny that the information was held to meet the legitimate interest, for the police to have a lawful basis for confirming or denying that the requested information is held, the above legitimate interest would have to outweigh the prejudice to the rights and freedoms or legitimate interests of the individual.</span></p>

              <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.35in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">On the facts of this case, any potential individual concerned would have a reasonable expectation that SP would not confirm or deny to the public under FOIA that the requested information was held as such a confirmation or denial would reveal whether disciplinary action had been taken against the individual who is (and was at the time of the response to the request) no longer a serving police officer. Further, confirmation or denial to the public would cause unwarranted distress to the individual.</span></p>

              <p class="ListParagraph" style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.35in"><span style="font-family:'Book Antiqua';color:#000000">The grounds of appeal the Commissioner argues, focus on the Appellant’s private interest in seeking confirmation or denial that the requested information is held concerning the behaviour of the individual towards the Appellant and his family. There is no suggestion in the grounds that the individual has demonstrated such behaviour to other members of the public. As such, the Commissioner argues any legitimate interest in confirmation or denial suggested by the Appellant in the grounds of appeal is accordingly limited. The Tribunal endorse and accept this limitation on the Appellant’s legitimate interest.</span></p>

The request to the ICO was made on 25 March 2022 and refers in some detail to an alleged specific incident. However, in his grounds of appeal he has referred to the alleged assailant as being guilty of intimidating behaviour for over a period of three years. It is difficult to identify when the alleged incident he has described occurred or when any of the alleged intimidating behaviour commenced but it would appear to be over three years prior to 5 March 2023. The relevance of this is in the Legitimate Interest that arises from the background generally and when it is said to have arisen. </span></p>

There was no public access to misconduct hearings, and they were chaired by a Senior Officer. The position on publication of information changed on 1 May 2015. The Police Conduct regulations 2012/2632 were amended in various ways, introducing a legally qualified Chair, publicly accessible hearings, pre-hearing notices, and post hearing notices (publishing the result of the public hearing for at least 28 days). These changes were not retrospective for any matters prior to 2012. In 2017, regulations were introduced which require that details of any police officer dismissed for misconduct are placed on a publicly searchable list. In 2020, the new Police (Conduct) Regulations 2020/4 were introduced, and the post-hearing notice was replaced by publication of the misconduct hearing panels full rationale. It is up to the Chair of the Panel as to the content of the documents, and the Chair can decide not to publish at all if appropriate. The Chair can also grant anonymity to any subject of such a hearing.</span></p>

However, the Tribunal notes the relevance of these for similar investigations by the ICO into such alleged complaints against police officers, and in this appeal. The significance of the Police (Conduct) Regulations 2020 is twofold: (a) the regulations acknowledge a wider public interest in disclosure of misconduct outcomes and (b) for police officers, subject to misconduct hearings, the expectation of confidentiality is significantly lessened except where the Legally Qualified Chair (LQC) decides not to publish.  </span></p>
