            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">By this action, the Claimant sues the Defendants for infringement of European Patent (UK) EP 2 489 332 C2 (<span style="font-weight:bold">the Patent</span>). The Defendants deny infringement and counterclaim for revocation on the basis that the Patent is anticipated and obvious over two pieces of prior art: US 7 379 912 B1 (<span style="font-weight:bold">Kiliccote</span>) and EP 2 073 160 A1 (<span style="font-weight:bold">Schmidt</span>), and that it is invalid for added matter, extension of protection and uncertainty insufficiency. The infringement allegation relates to claims 1 and 7; the validity attacks relate to claims 1, 2, 7 and 8 (although not all the attacks relate to all the claims). </p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">In simplified terms, the Patent concerns a method (claims 1, 2) and a system (claims 7, 8) for identifying a user so that it can obtain access to a registered service. It involves the use of graphical encoded information or graphical object (for example in the form of a barcode or QR code) that is displayed on a display of a computing apparatus and scanned by the user’s mobile device (such as a mobile phone). The information is either decoded by the mobile device (claims 1, 7) or by a server (claims 2, 8). Either way, the server establishes the identity of the user to determine if the user is registered, and if so, authorises the user to access the service.</p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The alleged infringement is a mobile payment system comprising a mobile phone app which can be used by registered customers at Shell petrol stations to purchase fuel. There are three iterations of the system that are relevant to infringement. The system comprises a number of sequential steps which I describe in more detail below. At this stage, it suffices to note that one of the steps requires the user to scan a QR code that is displayed on a piece of paper or card that has been attached on or near to the petrol pump. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Patent was filed on 25 November 2010 (<span style="font-weight:bold">the Filing Date</span>) and there is no earlier claim to priority. The Patent was amended post-grant under s.27 of the Patents Act 1977, and so it is the C specification that is relevant. There were amendments to both the description and the claims. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The amendments to the description include various statements that some of the embodiments and figures are “outside the scope of the claims”.

This depends on the proper construction of the application as filed and the B specification, to which I return below.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">First, they criticised the fact that Prof Martin was given the original cited prior art before he was asked about the common general knowledge. This included two citations (referred to as Cobos and Trandal) which were dropped at some point before trial but which (I am told) were focused on cryptography. The Defendants pointed out that this approach was contrary to the established way in which an expert in a patent case should be instructed (at least where possible): the expert should generally discuss the CGK first, before being shown the prior art and then the patent in suit (see <span style="font-style:italic">Fisher &amp; Paykel Healthcare Ltd v Flexicare Medical Ltd &amp; Anr </span>[2020] EWHC 3282 (Pat) at [20]). They submitted that this misdirection caused Prof Martin to “start off on the wrong path”, with CGK that was focused on the prior art and not on the field of the invention of the Patent. In particular, his first report included significant detail about cryptography even though he accepted in cross-examination that that there was no direct cryptographic interest in the Patent, but did not address barcodes and their uses. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Claimant did not accept this criticism, arguing that there had to be a way of focussing the CGK and that the alternative of devising “bespoke” CGK relating to a more specific field or area that had been suggested by the instructing solicitors would be equally problematic. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">I reject this argument, which did not justify why the Claimant had departed from the normal approach of sequential unmasking. Moreover, as Meade J made clear in <span style="font-style:italic">Fisher &amp; Paykel </span>at [22], it is normally possible to direct initial discussions with an expert about CGK in a practical or workable way by describing the area of interest in general terms. That approach is preferable to showing the expert the prior art first. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">However, as the Defendants accepted, even though Prof Martin addressed matters in the wrong order, in the end it did not seem to impact on the scope of CGK which was largely agreed between the parties.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Second, the Defendants criticised Prof Martin’s approach to the prior art. This was because it became apparent during cross-examination that his written evidence was focussed on the claims of the prior art, and he had disregarded the disclosures in the description of both Kiliccote and Schmidt to the extent that they were different. Once this error was identified, he fairly accepted in cross-examination that certain relevant features were disclosed in the prior art even though he had maintained in chief that they were not. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Defendants also argued that the combination of these two errors caused Prof Martin to take an approach to anticipation and obviousness that was too narrow and put him in an incorrect mindset that it was far too late to rectify in cross-examination. I do not think that there is any force to this submission, particularly bearing in mind what I have just said about the broad agreement on the CGK and the fact that Prof Martin changed his evidence about what the prior art disclosed once he understood the correct approach. </p>

Two documents in particular were the subject of cross-examination, referred to as “the Gao paper” and “the Gumball Machine”. The Claimant submitted that no proper consideration was given to whether these documents were CGK, and that this casts doubt about the reliability of Dr Berisso’s evidence more generally. I do not think that there is anything in this criticism. This is because Dr Berisso did not suggest in his written evidence that the documents themselves were CGK (and he confirmed in cross-examination that they were not). Rather, they were intended to illustrate concepts which were said to be CGK, and which were largely agreed. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">In my judgment, the Claimant is correct on this issue. The invention is aimed at providing a secure means of identifying a user so that they can obtain access via a computing apparatus to a service that they are registered to use. This is clear from the section headed “Background to the Invention” at the start of the description which explains that the invention was made with a view to preventing different types of fraudulent activity, of which “man-in-the-middle attacks” are but one example (contrary to the Defendants’ submission). It is also clear from the concluding section which states that “[t]<span style="font-style:italic">he invention provides a new and inventive way of providing secure access to services</span>” (p.26 line 8-9).  This section of the Patent lists a number of perceived advantages of the invention, of which avoiding “man-in-the-middle attacks” is again only one. All the advantages relate to improved security. Whilst the method and system of the Patent deploys a graphical encoded information item (of which a barcode is the exemplar), that does not mean that using barcodes is part of the problem that the invention aims to solve. </p>

By contrast, the Defendants said that since the Patent specifically relates to the use of barcodes, the skilled person was a systems engineer within the field of AutoID.

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">However, in cross-examination, both experts changed their position somewhat. Prof Martin gave evidence that the field of AutoID and the wider field of information security have points of intersection. In particular, he said that the skilled person in the field of information security would recognise that barcodes could be used as a security technology and deployed for authentication and identification management purposes, but they would not have expertise in barcode symbology or the detailed algorithms required for decoding barcodes. Whilst he maintained the view that the Patent was addressing a security problem and fell within the area of information security, he accepted it also intersected with that part of the field of AutoID that related to the applications or uses of AutoID technology. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Dr Berisso’s evidence was to the same effect. He agreed that the Patent was not aimed at someone who designs barcodes, any more than it was aimed at someone who was a specialist in cryptography. He accepted that it was directed towards someone involved in implementing systems who was an information security generalist, and that they could come from the AutoID field or the information security field. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The upshot of this evidence is that it does not matter whether the skilled person originates in the information security field or the AutoID field, as the problem that the Patent is aimed at sits at the intersection between them. This probably explains why, even though the experts came from these different fields, the parties largely agreed on the CGK, and the issues of validity and infringement did not depend on the few points that remained in dispute. </p>

The Claimant submitted that the skilled person is a systems implementer who is an information security generalist. Whilst the Defendants formally maintained their primary position that the skilled person was an AutoID systems engineer, the fall-back position was that it was someone who fell within the intersection. The Claimant’s characterisation of the skilled person and the Defendants’ fall-back position are effectively the same.</p>

              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">Data encoding – Encoding is the conversion of data (information) from one form to another. Typically, in AutoID, alphanumeric characters are translated into a form that can be read by a machine. For example, a part number or a URL may be converted into, or encoded into a bar code symbology, which is machine readable. The two predominant technologies used today are bar codes and RFID, described further below. Other technologies include biometrics, magnetic stripe (often seen on the back of bank cards), and smart cards. </p>

For example, in automatic identification, information or data may be converted from a machine-readable format back into a human readable format. For example, a part number or a URL that is in a bar code form (e.g. as a QR Code) may be converted or decoded into a human readable format (e.g. letters and numbers) by a bar code scanner.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">A representative example is the use of bar codes on groceries. When the cashier scans the bar code on a grocery item at the checkout, the scanner transmits the item identifier (reference number for the grocery item) to the store's server, together with the scanner identifier. The computer looks for the price of the item that matches the identifier, sends that information back to the cash register associated with the scanner identifier, and the cash register then displays the price. At the same time, the computer alters the records in the database by reducing the number of that item in stock, resulting in real time inventory records of stocked items. The same can be implemented using an RFID tag (sometimes called transponders, to which information can be encoded) whose information can be decoded by a scanner which communicates wirelessly to the server/database. This process is impractical to replicate in terms of speed and accuracy by manual input.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Typically, an RFID system consists of transponders, readers, and a server/database. Like barcodes, information, for example, identifiers such as serial numbers, expiration codes, reference numbers can be encoded by programming into a transponder. A transponder is essentially a microprocessor chip consisting of an integrated circuit with memory. Active transponders have an on-board power supply which enables active transmission of information on a persistent basis, whereas passive transponders only transmit when interrogated by the reader. Passive transponders can operate without power as they can absorb the radio energy from the reader to generate the power needed to transmit radio signals. There are also battery assisted passive transponders which come with a battery to enhance the read range. In addition, transponders may operate in different frequencies. The information in the transponders can only be decoded by compatible readers (sometimes called interrogators) which use the correct frequency and protocols to read the transponders. Transponders with different attributes have different characteristics such as the length of the read range, which is chosen depending on the application.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">AutoID has been used to keep an inventory of items and where each item is stored, typically in a large warehouse, or a number of warehouses. Each storage location is labelled with a unique barcode which then serves as a location identifier. The database would record relevant information, such as the description of the items in a location (for example, spanners of particular size) together with the unique identifier of the item (for example, UPC number) and the location ID, together with the number of items stored. A worker working in the warehouse could then scan the location and the item every time the item is being stored or retrieved so that the database can keep track of the volumes of the different items that can be located in each labelled location. A custom application would be used to enable the worker to update that “x” number of items were added to, or removed, as the case may be, from location “y”. In some instances additional logic could be added to the software and the location barcodes, such as adding an extra character (for example, “L” to indicate location) as a simple form of error checking to ensure that the person using the system is scanning the location and not the item.</p>

In the case of mail and parcels, the bar codes on them are scanned to enable automatic sorting and thereafter, scanned when they reach the delivery point. Because the scanner at the delivery point will communicate its scanner ID/location ID together with the item ID, the database can then maintain a record of whether the item has reached the delivery point.

Neither party framed its case on validity by reference to these points specifically, which would tend to suggest that they do not need to be resolved. However, the Defendants argued that they were still relevant since the first point demonstrates the degree of knowledge that the skilled person has about implementing systems; and the second point provides the framework against which the Patent should be assessed and may also shed light on the extent to which the skilled person would consider the use of different barcode carriers such as digital displays, posters and other materials.  <span style="font-size:11.5pt">Whilst the two points were presented separately (at least by the Defendants in argument), they are overlapping issues and I find it more convenient to address them together, particularly in light of how the evidence came out. </span></p>

Fraudsters use a wide variety of mechanisms to in order to illegally elicit personal information such as usernames, passwords, dates of birth and addresses with a view to cloning identities. One such mechanism is where a fraudster provides a spoof (or clone) of a website, which to an unsuspecting user appears identical to the original. Believing that the website is the original, the user provides personal information, such as login details or credit card details, which are recorded by the fraudster. A more sophisticated approach is a "man-in-the-middle attack" in which a fraudster provides the clone website and records the personal information, but also passes the personal information to the real website, which logs the user in as normal. In this way, the user does not notice anything different and the fraudster is able to obtain the personal information without alerting the user. This invention was made with a view to preventing these and other similar types of fraudulent activity.</span></p>

              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">The provision of encoded information reduces the possibility of a “man-in-the-middle attack”. The description states that “<span style="font-style:italic">[t]he invention is particularly effective in this respect in embodiments in which the computer program code for generating the encoded information item is stored on the computer apparatus 10 and is configured such that the encoded information item is only provided (i.e. displayed, emitted, output etc.) when direct communication with an application running on the web server 14; 16 is established</span>”. It goes on to explain that this is because, if there is a proxy server between the computing apparatus and one of the servers, the encoded information cannot be provided to the computing apparatus, the user will not be able to access the service and sensitive information will not thereby be divulged. </p>

              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">If the system employs the optional means of verifying the encoded information item (which can be achieved by a verification item that is changed periodically), this reduces the chances of fraudsters cloning the encoded information item and the service.</p>

              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in;text-indent:0.11in">The provision of encoded information also reduces the amount of personal information (e.g. usernames and passwords) that are required to access the service, the security of which may be compromised. </p>

              <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.79in">Security advantages are also achieved by using a device (such as a mobile) to establish communication with the server and the identity of the user which is separate from the computing apparatus that is then used to access the service from the server. This is said to take the authentication process “out of band” and adds security because it is more difficult for a fraudster to detect, intercept or compromise multiple communication channels or bands. </p>

            <content>
              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.6in">(ii)  <marker name="tab" />Article 69 says that the extent of protection is determined by the claims.

            <content>
              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.6in">(iv)  <marker name="tab" />It further follows that the claims must not be construed as if they stood alone – the drawings and description only being used to resolve any ambiguity. Purpose is vital to the construction of claims.</p>

            <content>
              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.6in">(v)  <marker name="tab" />When ascertaining the inventor's purpose, it must be remembered that he may have several purposes depending on the level of generality of his invention. Typically, for instance, an inventor may have one, generally more than one, specific embodiment as well as a generalised concept. But there is no presumption that the patentee necessarily intended the widest possible meaning consistent with his purpose be given to the words that he used: purpose and meaning are different.</p>

One is still at the end of the day concerned with the meaning of the language used. Hence the other extreme of the Protocol – a mere guideline – is also ruled out by Article 69 itself. It is the terms of the claims which delineate the patentee's territory.</p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:0.6in">(viii)  It also follows that where a patentee has used a word or phrase which, acontextually, might have a particular meaning (narrow or wide) it does not necessarily have that meaning in context.</p>

I was not shown any authority in support of this submission. Instead, counsel for the Defendants said that it was based on first principles, by reference to what the reasonable person would do when faced with the Patent. In this regard, she reminded me of the passage of Lord Hoffman<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>in <span style="font-style:italic">Kirin-Amgen Inc v Transkaryotic Therapies Inc </span>[2004] UKHL 46 at [32], where he explained that construction is concerned with “<span style="font-style:italic">what a reasonable person to whom the utterance was addressed </span>[i.e. the skilled person] <span style="font-style:italic">would have understood the author to be using the words to mean</span>”. <span style="font-style:italic"> </span>Counsel for the Defendants argued that since the skilled person was told that certain embodiments fell outside the claim, they would not think they were pertinent to the invention and so would ignore them.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">I reject the Defendants’ submission for the following reasons. First, I do not think that the passage to which I was referred in <span style="font-style:italic">Kirin-Amgen</span> is on point. That passage emphasises that construction is determined through the eyes of the skilled person and is based on what he/she would understand the words of the claim to mean. However, it says nothing about the skilled person ignoring parts of the description for that purpose. Secondly, the submission is contrary to principles (ii) to (iv) of <span style="font-style:italic">Virgin </span>as quoted above, which require construction of the claims in the context of the description as a whole (as argued by the Claimant). Thirdly, it is also contrary to common sense. In my judgment, the skilled person will take heed of the parts of the description which are expressed to fall outside the claim just as much as those parts which fall within it. This is because they still serve to help the skilled person understand the scope of the claim and what the words of the claim mean in that context. Fourthly, if the express teaching that an embodiment is outside the claim impacts on what the claim means and that teaching was added by amendment, it may be that matter has been added or protection has been extended, but that is a different point. It does not provide a basis for ignoring that teaching for the purposes of construction. </p>

In my judgment the term is broader than a conventional computer (such as desktop or laptop) and is intended to encompass any kind of apparatus that has computing functionality.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The first point from the passage is that the GO is said to be displayed “geographically proximate” to the electronic door. That does not seem to present any conceptual difficulties. It suggests that the GO is physically located close to the electronic door, and there are obvious practical reasons why that would be appropriate in the context of this embodiment. It also suggests that the GO is separate from the electronic door. This is consistent with and provides context for my view that the display and electronic apparatus of the claim do not have to be part of the same device (see paragraph 126 above).  The Claimant submitted that, properly construed, the claim required the sign to be geographically proximate to the electronic apparatus, but I do not think that the skilled reader would understand the claim to be limited in this way because geographical proximity between the display and the electronic apparatus is not required for the invention to work (albeit that it may be a convenient or practical implementation for certain applications). </p>

By contrast, a GO “provided on an electronic display” is outside the scope of the claim. Based on this teaching, the Claimant argued that the requirement of the claim that “the display is a sign” must be understood in context to exclude an electronic display. I accept that, whatever “sign” means, it does not mean an electronic display, although that is also not the end of the analysis.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The third point from the passage is that it teaches that the encoded information item (i.e. the GO) may be updated periodically following receipt of signals from the first server apparatus. The Claimant argued that this teaching only relates to the embodiments outside the scope of the claims. It points to the opening phrase of the last sentence which starts “In <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">such</span> embodiments…” (emphasis added) and says that this phrase only links back to the previous sentence because (i) the use of the plural “embodiments” must relate back to the plural “embodiments” identified in the previous sentence (i.e. those said to be outside the scope of the claims) and (ii) the use of “such” is intended to limit the teaching to that subset of embodiments. The Claimant also said that it makes sense to limit the teaching in this way, since the requirement for periodic updating by way of signals from the first server is only consistent with a GO that is provided on an electronic display. As a result, it submitted that the skilled reader understands that it is only the embodiments where the GO is provided on an electronic display that can be updated from time to time.</p>

As a result, the Defendants said it provides a general teaching that the GO may be changed from time to time and reinforces the view that the last sentence of the passage on p.22 of the Patent would not be understood by the skilled reader to relate only to the electronic display that is outside the scope of the claim. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">I prefer the Claimant’s argument on this point and agree that the requirement for periodic updating in the context of the building security embodiment is limited to the electronic display. In my judgment the phrase “In such embodiments” will be understood by the skilled reader to refer back to the previous sentence, namely to “embodiments outside the scope of the claims”. That is the normal way to read it as a matter of English within the context of the passage on p.22 of the Patent. I do not think that the later passage which the Defendants relied upon as set out at paragraph 140 above alters the analysis. This is because that later passage makes clear that periodic updating is only required for some embodiments (albeit it does not say which ones). As a result, the way in which I think the skilled reader would understand the passage on p.22 of the Patent is consistent with its later teaching.</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">First, in relation to the passage on p.22, the Defendants said that since the computing apparatus is identified by the reference numeral 10, the skilled reader will refer back to Figure 1 of the Patent where the computing apparatus 10 is introduced. As noted above, Figure 1 is the only figure that is not said to fall outside the scope of the claims. This figure is said to show “a system in which embodiments of the invention can be implemented”. It comprises a standard computing apparatus (10) with a controller (100) that can communicate with a display (104). The Defendants relied on the description at p.10 lines 9-11 which states that “<span style="font-style:italic">the controller 100 is operable under the control of the computer-readable code to control the other components such as the display 104</span>”. This is clear teaching that the controller of the computing apparatus controls the display, at least in relation to Figure 1. The Defendants submitted that that teaching is consistent with the display being an electronic display whose output is controlled by the controller with computer readable code and said that is how the skilled reader would understand it, consistently with what is shown in Figure 1. They pointed out that there is no reference in Figure 1 to a static, non-electronic sign and, moreover, such a sign could not be controlled by the controller in accordance with this teaching. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">However, the Claimant countered that this argument did not take into account that Figure 1 related to a system (i.e. hardware capable of implementing a method) rather than to the method itself. It also pointed to the passage on p.22 from lines 6 to 11 which introduces the embodiments and which I set out at paragraph 104 above. It argued that this passage makes clear that the implementation of the invention in the form of the embodiments may only include some of the features of the system already described. As a result, it said that there was no difficulty with the fact that the system as described in Figure 1 comprised features which are not used in the method as claimed.

In cross-examination, Prof Martin accepted that the skilled person would understand this teaching to require the display of the GO on a computer screen. It follows that if the Claimant’s construction is correct, it means that this advantage of the invention is lost. This was accepted by the Claimant in argument. The Claimant also accepted that the advantage set out at paragraph 113113.ii) above could not be achieved with a static sign.

This purpose is achieved with either party’s construction even if some of the other advantages cannot be obtained on the Claimant’s construction as I have just said.

This is the only reference to “sign” in the description, and hence the only place where the skilled reader gets any direct teaching as to what it means in the context of the claims (it was common ground that “sign” is not a term of art). As a result, in my judgment it is a passage to which the skilled reader will attach significant weight. The passage says expressly that the GO may be displayed on a sign but that an electronic display is outside the scope of the claim. The only way to make sense of this teaching is that the patentee intended a sign within the meaning of the claim to be something which is not an electronic display. Moreover, since the option for periodic updating in the context of this passage only relates to the electronic display (as I have explained at paragraph 143 above), the skilled reader will understand that the sign is not electronic and does not change between transactions. </p>

However, I consider that the Claimant's construction is consistent with <span style="font-style:italic">Virgin </span>principles (v) – (vii). In particular, since the patentee has deliberately limited the claim to a display on a sign, this limitation cannot be disregarded even though it conflicts with some of the teaching of the Patent and does not provide all the advantages of the invention that an electronic display would bring. I do not think that conflicts with the inventor’s purpose for the reasons I have given. </p>

First, the Claimant’s construction is predicated on the fact that a sign which cannot be updated is not electronic. However, the corollary of that argument is that a sign which can be updated is necessarily electronic. That is something which the Claimant’s counsel accepted in oral closings.  This concession is important in the context of added matter and extent of protection (see further below). Second, the Claimant’s construction is based on a broad interpretation of “computing apparatus” which necessarily includes the situation where the display and electronic apparatus are not in direct communication with each other and where the display has been generated independently of the electronic apparatus.

They said that the word “first” must be given its natural meaning and that, as a result, this must be the first time which the device or user is identified. They also said that the effect of these integers is that only one message and one server are required before the user can access the service.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">This point of construction matters for infringement because the Shell system utilises two messages which are conveyed to the server which identify the user, and with the later iterations, each of those messages goes to a different server. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Claimant submitted that this construction is wrong, and that the word “first” merely acts as a means of distinguishing that message from other messages in the description. It said that the claim does not preclude a system where there has been an earlier message sent before the “first message” which also serves to identify the user. It pointed to the passage on p.20 lines 20-25 which provides that, prior to preparing and sending the first message, the application on the portable device may request security information to be provided by the user via the user interface of the device so as to allow the identity of the user to be verified. This can be done by a variety of different means, including a pin, a password or biometric information. However, it is important to note that this optional preliminary step relates to identification of the user by the device and not by the server, so I do not think that this passage is directly relevant. What is more useful is the description of Figure 2 which differentiates the “first” message and server from a “second” message and server. I think that the skilled reader would understand these terms to be used in context as a means of differentiation and not as a limit on the number of messages which can be sent. Whilst I appreciate that this Figure is outside the scope of the claims, it enables the skilled reader to understand why the term “first” appears in the claims at all. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">It follows that the claim is not limited to a situation where the server identifies the user or device once and once only. All that it requires is that the “first message” is transmitted to the server and that it includes the decoded information and the means to identify the device or user. It does not limit how many messages are sent or whether other messages can be sent to the server identifying the user before the “first message”. Whilst multiple messages would be less efficient, they do not undermine the purpose of the invention which is to provide secure access to services. In my judgment, the word “first” is used as a means of differentiating the message and the server from other messages and servers, and no more. </p>

They put the argument in three ways. First, they said that there is no clear and unambiguous teaching in the application as filed that the display can be non-electronic. Second, in the alternative, if there is such disclosure in the application, then it is only in the specific context of the building security embodiment and introducing it into the claim amounts to an impermissible intermediate generalisation. Third, they argued that matter has been added by the addition of references to “electronic apparatus” in the claims which did not appear in the application as filed. </p>

They submitted, therefore, that the skilled reader will understand “sign” to be digital or electronic. They said that this understanding is reinforced by the subsequent teaching that the encoded information can be updated periodically following receipt of signals from the server because this is only possible with respect to an electronic display. In any event, they argued that there is no clear and unambiguous disclosure in this passage of a sign that is static, either in the sense that it is not electronic or that it cannot be changed. </p>

It is trite law that the claims of the application are part of the disclosure (although there can be a difference between what is disclosed by a claim and what falls within its scope). The Defendants argued that this wording teaches that the display is a display of a computing apparatus and will be understood in context of the application as a whole to relate to an electronic display. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">First, it said that since one embodiment in the passage relates to an electronic display, the other alternative embodiment that relates to a sign must be something which is not electronic. This is the same submission that I accepted in respect of the construction of the Patent, but it is important to note that the context here is different. In respect of the Patent, the teaching is that only the electronic display can be periodically updated but that it falls outside the scope of the claim. That teaching directly impacts on what the reader understands by the word “sign”. By contrast, in the application as filed, the teaching that the electronic display falls outside the scope of the claim is not present. Instead, the skilled reader is taught that the display can be an electronic display or a sign, and both are within the scope of the claims.  As a result, whilst the skilled reader would appreciate that<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>the patentee intended for the concept of the sign to be different in some way from that of the electronic display, there is no reason why they would think that the sign will not be electronic. To the contrary, Dr Berisso gave unchallenged evidence that the skilled reader would understand “sign” in this context to relate to some kind of digital sign including e-paper screens, LCDs or LEDs. This evidence was consistent with the agreed CGK at paragraph 65 above. </p>

In my judgment, the skilled reader will understand this passage to teach that where the GO is displayed on a sign or an electronic display it can be updated periodically following receipt of signals from the server. Note that this is another point where I have reached a different decision from the Patent, again because the teaching and context is different. In the Patent, the addition of the phrase “In embodiments outside the scope of the claims” changes the sense of the next sentence and means that it is only understood to apply to the electronic display.</p>

The server performs an action on the decoded information and sends a signal to the computing apparatus based on the apparatus identification information item (see p.2 lines 6-20; p.4 line 26-28; p.5 lines 7-13; p.6 lines 1-7). The Defendants submitted that this teaches that the apparatus identification information item is transmitted to the computing apparatus and not to the electronic apparatus. They also pointed to the text of the application which states that the service is provided by the first server apparatus (p.13 line 22) or by the second server apparatus (p.15 line 33 – p.16 line 1). The Defendants said that this is different from the amended claim, which discloses that the electronic apparatus provides the services to the user, and that the amended claim comprises new disclosure about the invention that cannot be found in the application at all (or certainly not in a way that is clear and unambiguous). </p>

However, I consider that the additional final integer, which requires that it is the electronic apparatus which provides the service to the user is new disclosure which changes the way the invention works. I do not agree that the passage the Claimant relies upon as quoted directly above provides support for this amendment. To the contrary, that passage is consistent with the teaching set out in paragraph 185 above to the effect that it is the server that provides the service to the user by authorising the door to open, and not the electronic door itself. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Consistent with its case in respect of the application as filed, the Claimant submitted that this passage teaches two alternatives: a static sign and an electronic display. However, unlike the C Specification, in the B Specification the embodiment where the GO is provided on an electronic display is not outside the scope of the claims. In my judgment, this has several consequences. First, in the context of this passage, there cannot be any doubt that the last sentence refers to both embodiments of the building security system that are described in the preceding two sentences (i.e. where the GO is displayed on a sign or on an electronic display). Second, this means that the embodiment where the GO is displayed on a sign is one where the GO can be updated periodically following receipt of signals from the first server. Third, it must follow that the sign is digital or electronic, albeit that it is different from an electronic display. Just as with the application as filed, I do not think it would even occur to the skilled reader reading the B Specification that the invention could be implemented using a static sign. </p>

Moreover, in my judgment, the skilled reader would construe this claim in the context of the B Specification as a whole to be limited to an electronic display. That is the natural reading of the integer and is consistent with the teaching of the document (contrary to the Claimant’s submissions). The claim does not cover a display or sign that is not electronic. If the skilled reader thought that the building security embodiment where the GO is displayed on a sign related to something that was not electronic (which I do not believe that they would), they would simply conclude that the patentee had excluded that option from the scope of the claims. </p>

The passenger selects a route, and the machine displays a multidimensional barcode appropriate for that route. The passenger can use their mobile to photograph or scan the barcode from the display or from a paper print out if the machine has a printer unit. The data from the barcode is communicated in an encrypted manner to a server and decoded there. Checking information can be sent back to the passenger who confirms the selection, and payment is then made. Once payment goes through, a ticket may be printed by the machine or sent to the passenger electronically. </p>

I acknowledge that Schmidt teaches us that a barcode can appear on a printed piece of paper. However, in Schmidt this piece of paper is a printed version of a specific transaction (in particular, it features the amount charged for a specific taxi ride). This means that the non-digital “display” (the piece of paper) changes every time that the Schmidt system is used. Therefore, I do not agree that in Schmidt the barcode is displayed on a “static sign”, which to me is a display that is static across multiple transactions and not changing every time the system is used.</span></p>

There is no express teaching in Schmidt to the effect that the barcode must be different with every transaction. Whether or not that is the case will depend on the nature of the service in question. So, for example, whilst a taxi meter will generate a different barcode for each journey dependent upon the distance that has been travelled, that is not necessarily the case for the LPT embodiment where, for example, the same barcode <span style="font-style:italic">could </span>be used by different passengers for the same journey on a particular line.

However, Dr Berisso explained in chief (§§7.55, 7.66 – 7.67, 7.108) that decoding can be undertaken by the mobile device or the server.

I refer to paragraph 210 and paragraphs 213-214 above. Even if one allows for the fact that Prof Martin erroneously limited his understanding on the teaching of Schmidt to the claims (as he explained in cross-examination), his view does not make sense.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The Claimant criticised this cross-examination. It said that it was based on “the ingenuity of counsel” rather than evidence, and that it was unclear what was being put to the Professor. However, whilst arguably some of the questions could have been better phrased, I watched this cross-examination carefully and believe that Prof Martin understood what was being put to him. This is illustrated by the following exchange at T2/239/5-24:</p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">The answers that Prof Martin gave are consistent with the observations I made above at paragraph 224 above. In my judgment, it would have been obvious to the skilled reader at the priority date to implement the LPT ticket machine embodiment using barcodes that were the same for different passengers (and hence different transactions) in respect of travel on the same route or line. In this regard, I accept the unchallenged evidence of Dr Berisso that this would be a simple design choice.  It follows that it would have been obvious to implement that embodiment using a barcode that is static in the sense that it does not change between transactions. Since this was the only integer in dispute, it follows that claims 1 and 7 are obvious over Schmidt on the Claimant’s construction. </p>

This is consistent with what was accepted to be CGK at paragraph 89.i) above. It follows that these claims are also obvious over Schmidt on either construction.  </p>

I think he was right to do so, for the reasons I have set out in paragraph 224 above.</p>

Dr Berisso did not address this in chief specifically in the context of the solarium embodiment. He only gave general evidence that a printed sign may work better in certain circumstances, such as when the encoded information contains a URL to direct the user to a website or server or to identify an apparatus, but I do not think that went far enough to establish the Defendants’ case. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">It was suggested to Prof Martin in cross-examination that the solarium may comprise a piece of “legacy” equipment which did not have a terminal and in that situation, it would be obvious to implement the teaching of Schmidt using a barcode printed on a piece of paper instead. The Professor found this line of cross-examination confusing, and I have some sympathies with his position. It was not clear to me why the skilled reader would consider implementing this embodiment without a terminal, particularly when the terminal activates the solarium once payment is confirmed. Moreover, I cannot see that it helps the Defendants since the terminal comprises the computing apparatus of claim 1 of the Patent. It means (as the Claimant pointed out) that the Defendants’ attempt to demonstrate that it is obvious to implement the solarium embodiment using a paper sign is predicated on the basis that another integer of the claim is missing. It follows that I do not accept that there was anything in the criticism that the Defendants levelled against Prof Martin to the effect that he had refused to put himself in the place of the skilled person implementing the prior art. </p>

The system includes a server configured to present an image to the user via a computer, the image having information embedded therein, and a portable device configured to: allow the user to capture the image, store predetermined information, capture input information from the user, the input information to be used to ensure that the user is authorized to use the portable device, and generate an output based on the information embedded in the image and the predetermined information.  The server is further configured to receive output from the portable device and authenticate the user based on the output. Once the user is authenticated, the user is allowed to access a website via the computer to conduct a transaction with respect to an account associated with the user.</span></p>

It notes that authentication can be useful, for example, in relation to e-commerce transactions and that there are many authentication systems known in the art with related methodologies that use a wide range of techniques. Several prior art systems are then described, the details of which generally do not matter for the purposes of this case. However, the authors note the authentication used in respect of credit cards (PIN, numbers printed on the back of the card, etc) may be of nominal effectiveness because they are static (col 1 lines 30-37).  The authors state that it is desirable to provide methods and devices that are capable of providing secure transactions in a more efficient manner. </p>

Kiliccote states that the device operates in the manner set out in Figure 2. First, it is used to capture encoded information in an image, for example in the form of a barcode. The information is relevant to the transaction to be conducted. The device also prompts the user to provide identification information via the input (for example in the form of a PIN). The processor of the device then decodes the image and extracts the information. This may include predetermined information stored in the memory of the device, such as address information, personal profile information and payment information.

The user visits the website via a computing device and is presented with a log-on screen. After preliminary information is provided by the user (e.g. password), they are presented with an image such as a barcode. This is generated by the website and displayed on the computer screen. It contains embedded information that is used to obtain an authentication code required to access the website. The barcode is scanned or photographed by the user’s mobile phone or other secure device, which then derives the relevant information from the barcode. This will include the authentication code, which is displayed on the output screen of the phone. The user can then key in the authentication code into the computer to obtain access to the website. Alternatively, the authentication code can be transmitted to the computer in the form of a radio or sonic signal (if the computer has the appropriate receiver).</p>

They submitted that the “computing apparatus” of claim 1 was comprised of the merchant server and the catalog (or other sign).  They pointed out that this was consistent with the Claimant’s construction, which necessarily requires that “computing apparatus” is a wide term that covers the situation where the display and the electronic apparatus are not in direct communication with each other, albeit that they are associated in the broadest sense. I agree with this submission, which is consistent with what I have said above in the context of construction<span style="font-weight:bold"> </span>and also how the Claimant argued its case on infringement (see below). Prof Martin also accepted in cross-examination that there was teaching in the general summary of Kiliccote (before the embodiments) to the effect that the computing apparatus and the server are separate items. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">In the circumstances, I reject the Claimant’s argument to the contrary that the merchant’s server cannot be the computing apparatus of the claim. I found this part of the Claimant’s submissions confusing and difficult to follow, but so far as I understood them, the argument was that there had to be some kind of “return path” between the merchant server and the mobile phone and that was not disclosed in Kilicotte. This was not a point that was canvassed in evidence, and in any event does not seem to be relevant to the requirements of this integer or the claim. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">There was also a suggestion by the Claimant that the catalog of the Figure 9 embodiment could not be the display of the computing apparatus because it is physically remote from the server and there is no relationship or association between them. However, I have rejected the argument that the claim requires the sign to be geographically proximate to the electronic apparatus. Moreover, the claim does not require the encoded item to be generated by the electronic apparatus or for there to be any communication between them. In any event, this point was also inconsistent with the Claimant’s case on infringement. </p>

They argued that this amounted to disclosure of the integers of claim 1 which require decoding of the encoded information by the mobile phone and transmitting the decoded information as a first message to a first server apparatus, both of which I accept. The third-party service provider is the first server apparatus for this purpose. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">However, the Defendants also argued that as part of this teaching there was an implicit disclosure that “the first message including … a first identifier identifying the device or a user of the device”. This was because they said it would not be possible for a user to pay for something unless the user had been identified first. I do not accept this submission. There was no evidence from the experts in their written evidence in support of a case of implicit disclosure and it was not put to Prof Martin in cross-examination that the skilled reader would understand Kiliccote in this way based on their CGK. In my view, this does not amount to clear and unmistakable directions to do something which falls within this part of the claim. </p>

They submitted that this satisfied the related integer in claim 1 of “using the apparatus identification information item to transmit a signal to the electronic apparatus and the electronic apparatus providing the service to the user”.

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">It follows that Kiliccote does not anticipate claims 1 and 7 because it does not disclose transmission of a first message to a first server apparatus where that message includes a first identifier identifying the device or user of the device. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">For completeness, and in case this matter goes further, I should also deal briefly with the argument in respect of the Defendants’ construction. This was based on the disclosure in relation to Figure 3, where there is express disclosure that the server is configured to present the image to the user via a computer (col 3 lines 16-17). As I noted above, there is also this disclosure in the context of the Figure 9 embodiment. However, this makes no difference to my conclusion that Kiliccote does not anticipate claims 1 and 7, since the integer that is missing is not one which turns on this issue of construction in any event. </p>

            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">I can deal with this briefly, as both the evidence and the argument relating to this attack were very limited. As regards the evidence, Dr Berisso undertook a Pozzoli type analysis in his first report in respect of each integer of claim 1, saying whether he thought it was disclosed or obvious. However, I had difficulties with his evidence as he relied on different embodiments for the disclosure of different integers. I do not think that this is a legitimate approach for obviousness anymore than it is for anticipation. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">Perhaps in recognition of that problem, the Defendants limited their written and oral arguments to the Figure 9 embodiment, although most of the arguments were focused on the anticipation attack, and I was not addressed in any detail about the obviousness case separately. The Defendants’ main point was to refer to what Prof Martin had said in chief, where he accepted that the differences he perceived between Kiliccote and the Patent were obvious except the requirement (on the Claimant’s construction) that the encoded information is displayed on a sign which is static (i.e. non-electronic and does not change between transactions). As noted above, in cross-examination he accepted that a static sign was disclosed in the Figure 9 embodiment. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="BodyText" style="margin-left:0.39in">In the circumstances, I can see why the Defendants did not spend much time on this part of their case. However, despite what Prof Martin said in his written evidence, in my judgment the Defendants have not discharged the evidential burden in respect of this attack. First, neither expert addressed the Figure 9 embodiment in writing by reference to the integers of the claim. Second, whilst the Defendants’ counsel addressed some of the integers with Prof Martin in cross-examination, she did not address them all. I agree with the Claimant that the relevant questions were not put to the Professor. In particular, counsel for the Defendants did not put to him that it would be obvious to the skilled reader implementing the third-party server/printed sign variant of Figure 9 to include a first identifier identifying the device or user of the device in the message sent from the secure device to the server. As a result, there was no evidence to support this part of the Defendants’ case and I reject the attack of obviousness over Kiliccote. </p>

As Lord Russell put it in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Electrical &amp; Musical Industries v Lissen Ltd</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> (1939) 56 RPC 23, 39: “The function of the claims is to define clearly and with precision the monopoly claimed, so that others may know the exact boundary of the area within which they will be trespassers.”</span></p>

But once that exercise has been carried out (these days including the possibility of equivalents), the court will be able to answer the question whether someone has crossed the boundary “yes” or “no”.

Patent lawyers have traditionally called this “ambiguity” but I do not think that that expression is accurate. Something is ambiguous when it is capable of having two (or more) meanings, and ultimately the court will be able to decide which of them is the correct meaning. Rather, in my judgment, the issue here is that of uncertainty. If the court cannot ascertain the boundary, having used all the interpretative tools at its disposal, it must conclude that the specification does not disclose the invention clearly enough and completely enough for it to be performed by a person skilled in the art.</span></p>

However, I do not think that the claim is limited in that way. There is nothing in the language of the claim to support that construction; nor is it consistent with the teaching in the Patent or the purpose of the invention. The second point of evidence is correct as far as it goes, but ignores the fact that Prof Martin stressed that even if the digital hash value was an identifier, it still identified the user (albeit indirectly) and that they were registered to use the service. The third point does not seem to take the debate any further forward, since the upshot of this evidence is that, on the balance of probabilities, the digital hash value contains the user credentials. This will necessarily serve to identify the user. </p>

As noted above, with these subsequent iterations of the Shell system, the MPP is used at Step 7 but the user token which is sent as part of the first message is checked with the CIPM. In other words, two servers are used to achieve what is done with one server in the claim. Moreover, the claim requires the first message to be sent to the first server and for the first server, upon receiving the first message, to establish the identity of the user. In the second and third iterations the server that receives the first message (MPP) is not the same as the server that establishes the identity of the user (CIPM). It follows that the second and third iterations of the Shell system do not fall within the scope of the claim because the first server of the claim (MPP) is not the server that establishes the identity of the user of the device, contrary to the requirements of the claim. </p>
