The father is noted as having accepted there was sexual contact, which he said was consensual, but the situation ‘turned’ when the mother saw a message from a dating site on his phone and became angry.

This was informed by a referral from the police after the allegation of sexual assault had been made in 2014, and which was maintained by the mother in the assessment.  Both the father and Sasha’s primary school had raised concerns about the mother’s care of the children and their presentation.  Sasha had expressed a wish to see her father, that her mother did not want her to go, and she was confused as to why this did not seem to be possible.  However, at the end of the assessment it says that Sasha aged five does not want to have any contact with her father and her views should be respected.  The reason the mother gave for the separation was that [the father] was already married when they met and had promised to divorce his wife but after five years together, he had not done so.  Both [the mother] and [the father] alleged that the other had been unfaithful in the relationship.</span></p>

During calls her speech has been pressured and meandering. Throughout, she has been extremely fixated on what she sees as institutional failings to address her and her children's needs. Whilst I was able to understand what she said, she did not answer my questions or speak coherently. Since our interview on 27/04/2021, [the mother] has forwarded me over 50 emails and called / texted repeatedly and at unsociable hours, which I found to be excessive and unusual. The emails she has sent have been rambling and bizarre in content and have almost entirely related to perceived institutional failings, [the father]'s alleged (non-specific) abusive behaviour, and her views about the children's mental health needs. Over the weekend of 01/05/2021 to 03/05/2021, [the mother] began sending emails to numerous agencies / professionals which I was cc'd into (including the Prime Minister, police, NSPCC, [London Borough of Z] MASH, CAMHS, NHS, Ofsted) which are similarly unusual. [The mother] also appeared to not recall previous conversations I have had with her when I have spoken to her later. [the mother]'s frenzied and apparently escalating behaviour led me to be very concerned her mental health, which led to me make a child protection referral on 04/05/2021.’</span></p>

He works a shift pattern of four days on and four days off, which means that on some occasions when he had the girls it was his partner who was with them, or when they were very small, sometimes a childminder, but he denied that this should be taken as any sign of his lack of commitment.  </span></p>

When the ADOS-2 assessment was considered alongside the formal interview, broader clinical assessments and observations, questionnaire data (including from each of her parents which results did not support diagnosis) and information from other professionals or sources, Dr Saywer and Ms Rogers concluded that there was insufficient evidence to support a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder.</span></p>

Another reason posited was that the fact of Sasha becoming more settled in her father’s care and in a place of safety may have enabled her to feel more able to express her distress.  They said her world at her mother’s was quite small, she was mostly at home with her mother and sister and not going out or to school, so not taxed in that environment.  At her father’s her world became bigger, she was supported to go to school, take the bus with a friend, or meet a friend in the park.  She was developing her abilities but at the same time would be increasingly aware of her own difficulties, finding it hard to socialise with peers, lacking skills many of them had.  Her understanding of herself as different was likely to be stronger in an environment with a more varied set of experiences.</span></p>

This is a third hand report of what Sasha is said to have told the officer so I must be cautious as to the weight I give it.  After the description of the hair pulling incident, the officer asked Sasha if [the mother] hurt her in other ways.  Sasha is reported to have said, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">‘she says mean things’,</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt"> for example, </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:12pt">‘she said how do you still have friends and stuff like that’, she also said, ‘you’re a disrespectful child’ ….she just gets angry every day and says mean things.’</span></p>

I find that the entry in the school chronology for 29 January 2019 noting that [the mother] had been heard to call Sasha a ‘bitch’ is consistent with this pattern of behaviour and on a balance of probabilities I find to be accurate.

In the chronology at the outset of this judgment I have referred to the interactions with the two phlebotomists which are good illustrations of a pattern of mother being unable to provide the reassurance her daughter needed, being unsympathetic to the point of being mean, and then afterwards framing the situation as one in which Sasha’s particular difficulties, and the professionals’ inability to provide specialist help to meet those needs as the root cause of the problem.</span></p>

Sasha did not like Tara pulling her wig and told her it was rude of her to tell people it was a wig and to pull it as it might have come off.  [The mother] did not intervene either to endorse what Sasha had said to Tara, nor comfort Sasha.  Had Sasha’s head shave been her own choice, then one might have expected her mother to say something altogether more positive, to remind her of that choice and reassure her that it looked good.  Instead, what she said reinforced that the head-shaving had come about because of something that Sasha had done wrong; dyeing her hair too much, arguably something that [the mother] as Sasha’s parent could have protected her from.</span></p>
