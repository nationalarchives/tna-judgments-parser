I also directed that this hearing be a public hearing, listed with the names of the parties, and shall be a hybrid hearing at which each defendant has permission to attend remotely, and that all further documents in these contempt proceedings may be served on each defendant by the method set out in paragraph 14(b) of each Contempt Order (which I was, and remain, satisfied would ensure that all documentation would be received by each of Mr Goza and Mr Naumenko).</span></p>

The request is made on the basis that the Court  has a discretion to adjourn proceedings, a professed willingness of the Defendants to engage in disclosure, what is said to be very recent instruction of English solicitors, and what is asserted to be “limited prejudice to the Claimant – in fact, compliance with disclosure would assist the Claimant”. The Defendants pray in aid the overriding objective in CPR 1.1 of dealing with cases justly and at proportionate costs, which includes ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing and can participate fully in proceedings including by lawyers, and it also being pointed out that the issues at play at the sanctions hearing are very serious, with potential committal and the liberty of the Defendants at play. The Defendants’ Skeleton refers to the fact that the Defendants have said in the Groza Letter that they are willing and intend to comply with the Disclosure Order, and it is said that an adjournment would give a further opportunity to the Defendants to provide the outstanding disclosure and potentially purge the contempt and would be relevant in assessing what, if any, sanctions to impose.</span></p>

It is said that granting an adjournment would facilitate compliance which is in line, it is said, with the Court’s objective to ensure orders are obeyed. It is said that the Defendants have only very recently instructed M.B. Kemp LLP and counsel to represent them, and time is required for the legal team to review the materials, advise the Defendants on their position regarding the contempt proceedings and potential sanctions, and take instructions and prepare relevant disclosure and any necessary affidavit or witness statements. It is said that the Claimant will not suffer “significant” prejudice by the adjournment sought and “any delay would be outweighed by the benefits of compliance with the Disclosure Order”.</span></p>

His response was that he did not have any instructions, or associated evidence, in that regard. I also asked him why it was that there was no witness statement or affidavit which one would normally expect where an adjournment was being sought, and where, even if time was short, it is common (in the context of freezing orders and associated applications) to produce supporting evidence in a very short order after solicitors or counsel are instructed, including, if necessary, overnight. Again, he said that the only evidence that is before the Court is that which is set out in the Groza Letter and, on the basis of the instructions he had,  he had no further evidence to put before the Court.</span></p>

I am driven to what I am satisfied is the logical conclusion that it was a conscious decision on the part of Mr Naumenko and Mr Groza only to instruct solicitors at the very last minute, not least in circumstances where they were well aware of the possibility of instructing English solicitors immediately following the Contempt Judgment (and had done so in the past, and had been advised to do so as early as 2 September 2004 by Hogan Lovells in the Hogan Lovells Letter.

It was subsequently considered that further disclosure and information was necessary which led to the disclosure application and a Disclosure Order.  Another judge of this Court, Jacobs J, considered it appropriate to make the Disclosure Order  The whole purpose of the Disclosure Order is for the Defendants to provide further information to facilitate the policing of the freezing injunction, set against the backdrop of a case in which that same judge had considered that the present case as being one of the clearest cases in relation to the risk of unjustified dissipation of assets that he had seen.</span></p>

An even more recent example, and one which I address in the Contempt Judgment itself, is the fact that the late afternoon  before the committal hearing before me on 30 August an 80-page statement was served by Mr Naumenko (“Naumenko 5”), at 4.15 pm, and that statement, which was relied upon by Mr Naumenko and inferentially also Mr Groza, was not even served upon the Claimant.

Firstly, there is no relevant prejudice because any consequences for the Defendants are the consequences of the Defendants' own deliberate acts in not instructing English solicitors and counsel earlier, and even when belatedly instructing English solicitors not instructing English solicitors that are familiar with the action.</span></p>

There has not, in fact, been any evidence before me which would justify a conclusion that the Defendants have suffered any prejudice to date, or would suffer any further prejudice, if the proceedings were not adjourned.  They have had a lengthy period of time in which to put in any written submissions on their behalf, and have availed themselves of that.  As Mr Pillow points out, the time period concerned of over a month before this hearing and over three weeks before they had to put their mitigation submissions in, is very much longer than would often be the case in the context of committal proceedings, and proceeding to the sanction hearing itself after a finding of contempt. They have had every opportunity to put in whatever information they wish to put in.</span></p>

As addressed in the Contempt Judgment, the Defendants have been found to be in breach of the Disclosure Order and to have committed contempt, and they stand to be sentenced today in respect of such existing breaches that have already been established.  On any view, that punitive aspect of the sentence for existing breaches is fully formed and ready for determination today.  Equally the Defendants have been made aware in the Hogan Lovells Letter, that they could take steps to purge their contempt, and that if they did so that might reduce the coercive part of the sentence, yet they have not done so (as addressed further below in Schedule 1 in relation to the sanction hearing itself). </span></p>

That is a reason to proceed to sentence today rather than to adjourn – any coercive element can only facilitate future compliance relevant, and allow the Defendants to come good on ther promise to provide further information. </span></p>

The Claimants have suffered, and are continuing to suffer, very considerable cost consequences as a result of the Defendants' conduct to date.  The evidence before me is that the Defendants have failed to pay any of the costs orders that have been made to date, which include a costs order of some US$800,000 in relation to the Defendants’ unsuccessful discharge application in February 2024, and another costs order against the Defendants for US$170,000 in respect of the failed resistance to the disclosure application before Jacobs J.  There will then be an application before me today, for the Defendants to pay the costs of the contempt hearing and this hearing, which amount together to some US$284,000.  Whilst no such order has yet been made, one can obviously bear in mind the fact that the applicable principles in relation to the contempt hearing are that costs follow the event (quite apart from contractual provisions in place which the Claimant says entitles it to indemnity costs), and so that is an order of costs of whatever magnitude I ultimately order, that the  Defendants will also have to bear.</span></p>

As Mr Cherryman realistically accepted, there is no additional evidence before me today in relation to the adjournment application than there was in the Groza Letter itself, either in relation to why there should be an adjournment, or in relation to whether or not further time will allow further information to be provided.  I have already noted that there has been a complete lack of explanation or evidence as to why it is that English solicitors and Counsel were only instructed last night, and a lack of explanation as to why no further information has been provided since the Groza Letter, or to even begin to justify why (at least) a further eight weeks is now needed.</span></p>

Their reaction contemporaneously was to deliberately not provide the information, as I address in the Contempt Judgment.  Thereafter, even when faced with a committal application they did not provide the information necessary, and indeed went on the attack suggesting there was not even jurisdiction for there to be committal proceedings.  Even when they were found in contempt of court on 30 August 2024, that did not provoke them into promptly purging their contempt, or even providing prompt provision of any further information.  If the Defendants genuinely wished to purge their contempt they did not have to wait until 23 September 2024 to do so.  The direction that was given in relation to the 23 September 2024, was in relation to any mitigation, and whilst purging your contempt might be relevant to mitigation, the obligation to purge one's contempt is a continuing one, and could, if there was any genuine desire to purge contempt, start with information provision immediately after 30 August 2024.  That simply did not happen.</span></p>

There are shortcomings in the information that has been provided.  Some of the purported new information in the Groza Letter had already been provided previously, and so is not even new information, and there are paragraphs and subparagraphs of the Disclosure Order which have not been grappled with at all in the Groza Letter.  There is nothing, in terms of evidence, to lead to the conclusion that if given more time there will be a sudden conversion whereby the Defendants will purge their contempt.  Mr Pillow submits rightly, in my view, that one has to be, at the very least, circumspect with the assertions in the Groza Letter, and the expressions of apology, not least in circumstances where the Groza Letter contains no explanation whatsoever as to why the Disclosure Order was not originally complied with, nor why it was not complied with before the contempt proceedings, or, indeed, at any time to date. </span></p>

Nevertheless at the time the Groza Letter was served, the Groza Letter was clearly intended to include all the matters that he (and Mr Naumenko) wished to put before the Court by way of mitigation.  It is a long letter.  It is an eloquent letter, and it is one which was served on time, and in accordance with my directions order. I am satisfied that if there were good points to be made by Mr Groza and by Mr Naumenko (each of whom is very familiar with the issues in this action having lived through this litigation), by way of mitigation, they could and would have included them in the Groza Letter. If they chose not to take any legal advice at that time, that was their choice, but they have not been deprived of the opportunity of setting out any mitigation that is available to them. Equally, if an adjournment is not granted, then I will, of course, hear anything additional that Mr Cherryman wishes to say, and if Mr Cherryman is not instructed in respect of the sanction hearing itself, I will, of course, give Mr Groza a fair opportunity to say orally anything additional that he wishes to say (and to respond to whatever said on behalf of the Claimant by Mr Pillow). What I do not have is any evidence that the Defendants would have further mitigation that they have not been able to adduce to date, but would be able to adduce with more time. At most they are proferring the prospect of future compliance when they have not complied to date, and are in continuing contempt. That is no reason for an adjournment. </span></p>

Whilst Mr Groza has referred to alleged difficulties that his health has given him in relation to “collecting the information sought”, once again, as at the time of the contempt hearing, no evidence was given (or is now given) of what those problems were or are, or how he claims they have impacted (or continue to impact) upon the process of collecting the relevant information, including prior to 13 May 2024. As has previously been noted, Mr Groza knows full well what would be required in terms of such health evidence, and what evidence he would be required to produce in relation to any medical condition. Even now, and following the terms of the Contempt Judgment (which referred to the lack of medical evidence), Mr Groza has once again failed to adduce evidence in support of any alleged difficulties resulting from any health problem.</span></p>

The point is academic, however, as I do not consider that Mr Groza has produced any evidence in relation to his health which would distinguish his position from Mr Naumenko, not least in circumstances where such apology as Mr Groza has asserted, has not been accompanied by full compliance with the Disclosure Order, even after he has been found in contempt.</span></p>

Adjourning the hearing would, I am satisfied cause the Claimant real and continuing prejudice as the Defendants should have complied with the Disclosure Order in May 2024, many months ago, and they have not done so even after being found in contempt over a month ago. An adjournment, envisaged to be to after 30 November 2024, would result in further and continuing prejudice to the Claimant, both because the Claimant does not have the requisite information to place the freezing order, and also because it is suffering continuing prejudice due to the unpaid costs orders, and further costs would be thrown away if an adjournment was granted.</span></p>

The Claimant is entitled to the information that the Defendants were required to provide in the Disclosure Order, and I have already found that delays in these contempt proceedings would, in of themselves, prejudice the Claimant (see the Contempt Judgment at [56]). It is self-evident that a failure to provide the information required in the Disclosure Order, which the Court has considered necessary to police the injunctive relief granted, will prejudice the Claimant as the Claimant has been deprived of information to which the Court has determined it is entitled, and without which the dissipation of assets may be facilitated, and the prevention of dissipation of assets may be thwarted. In this regard, and as already noted in the Contempt Judgment (at [200]), another Judge of this court has found that the evidence of a risk of dissipation by the Defendants in this case is “as strong as any that I have ever seen”: [2024] EWHC 267 (Comm) per</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'"> </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Jacobs J at [94]).</span></p>

I am satisfied (and have already found) that the Defendants have “demonstrably and expressly failed to comply in any way with the Disclosure Order and indeed made clear their position that they would not do so immediately after the time for disclosure had expired” (Contempt Judgment at [199]). They also raised alleged defences which were “demonstrably untrue” (Contempt Judgment at [200]) and, importantly, they knew that their conduct was in breach of the Disclosure Order and “intentionally chose” not to comply with it (Contempt Judgment, [204(3)]). Whilst Mr Groza purports, in the Groza Letter, to “confirm his full willingness and intentions to fulfil all disclosure obligations” such confirmation is hollow in circumstances where he did not do so at the time he was required to do so, or before the contempt hearing, or even now (as further addressed in Schedule 1 hereto).</span></p>

Whilst not further articulated in the Groza Letter, it may be (or have been) the Defendants’ position that they perceived (and/or indeed were advised of) risks of compliance with the Disclosure Order in relation to ongoing criminal investigations. Mr Naumenko referred to such advice in Naumenko 5 (at 178-189 in relation to ongoing criminal proceedings in Cyprus and Ukraine - which evidence was not tested by cross-examination). However, the Defendants have not disclosed any written record or other evidence of any such advice (in which the Claimant says Mr Naumenko, at least, would now have waived privilege). </span></p>

The contemnors’ record in relation to past cooperation is poor. They absented themselves from the previous hearing without supplying sufficient evidence for their non-attendance, the Court having found that Mr Naumenko had “voluntarily absented himself” (Contempt Judgment at [40]) and that both Defendants had chosen not to be represented at the previous hearing, and had waived their right to be present (Contempt Judgment at [49]-[50]). The Court also found that Mr Groza’s medical evidence was “vague in the extreme and [did] not begin to justify” his non-attendance (Contempt Judgment at [51]). Mr Naumenko filed Naumenko 5 (his very substantial witness statement which was addressed at length in the Contempt Judgment) very late and unaccompanied by a Statement of Truth; and he failed to ensure that the Claimant’s solicitors had the relevant exhibits until a few minutes before the committal hearing began. The Groza Letter does not amount to compliance with the Disclosure Order (as to which see Schedule 1 hereto), and does not justify an adjournment (as I have already addressed and found above). To the extent that it contains anything that can be prayed in aid by way of mitigation (including a professed apology at least by Mr Groza), such apology is, at best, belated, and hollow given the continued breach of the Disclosure Order. In relation to the present hearing, neither Mr Groza not Mr Naumenko has appeared in person today. Equally, Mr Naumenko has not appeared by video link either, not only in the context of this sanctions hearing, but even in the context of his own application to adjourn this hearing which I have already addressed. </span></p>

It is also notable that whilst Mr Groza offers purported explanations of his professed inability to obtain information or documents now, those do not bear examination or are so general that they cannot be grappled with (as addressed at paragraph 32 of the Claimant’s Reply Submissions), and there was no justification or explanation as to why he (or Mr Naumenko) failed to disclose what was required of them under the Disclosure Order by the deadline set out in that Order (4pm on 13 May 2024) in circumstances where they consciously chose not to comply with the Disclosure Order, or at any time before the committal proceedings or Contempt Judgment.

In this regard I have considered their age, 65 in the case of Mr Groza and 54 in the case of Mr Naumenko, and Mr Groza’s health (to the limited extent that such information has been provided, and, historically at least, the same was relied upon more to explain absence than non-compliance). Age and health are matters which I take into account by way of mitigation in the context of any immediate custodial sentence in the impact of prison upon them,  but neither is a trump card militating against the same given the seriousness of the conduct that has been found. I have no evidence as to whether the Defendants are of previous good character, but I will assume they are. There is no evidence before me that either of the Defendants has caring responsibilities. I have also had regard to current prison conditions. Ultimately, however, there is a limit to which the available mitigation assists the Defendants when weighed against the seriousness of the breach of a disclosure order in support of a freezing injunction, such as the Disclosure Order in this case, not least in circumstances in which each of the Defendants is in continuing breach of the Disclosure Order.</span></p>

In the second witness statement of Dimitra Damaskopoulou, it was stated that the Defendants “did not receive dividends for the past 10 years” and that the Claimant’s claim that they did was “factually incorrect and misleading” (at paragraphs 28-29). However in her third witness statement, Ms Damaskopoulou instead she stated that she was “not yet in a position to confirm whether, in fact, [the Defendants] received any dividends at the time of making this statement”. No further confirmation was ever received from Hill Dickinson never provided any further confirmation (they sought to come off the record one day after the filing of Ms Damaskopoulou’s third witness statement), and there has been no further update on that position until the Groza Letter in which Mr Groza would appear to restate the initial position. On any view further information/explanation is required.  </span></p>

It is possible that any explanation might have revealed assets disclosable under the WFO. Whether that would be so or not, I am satisfied that Mr Groza has not engaged in the exercise required by paragraphs 1.3.2 and 1.3.3. of the Disclosure Order. This itself calls into question the (bare) denial of Mr Groza that he and Mr Naumenko received dividends from GNT. I am satisfied that the statement is inconsistent with the contemporaneous records and relies upon a new suggestion that the references to US$97 million of dividends in the accounts were merely “technical entries made at the request of our accountants”. This suggestion (which is not backed by any evidence from such accountants) at first blush appears less than credible. In this regard if this was in fact the position, I consider that there is no reason that this explanation could not have been set out previously in correspondence, or in the Defendants’ nine-page letter to the Court sent immediately before the Claimant’s application for disclosure, or at any time before the deadline for compliance with the Disclosure Order, or, indeed, in Naumenko 5.</span></p>
