              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">This is an appeal against an order of Chief Insolvency and Companies Court Judge Briggs made on 23 February 2021. On that day, the Judge handed down judgment following a 6-day trial that took place fully remotely between 1 and 9 February 2021.</p>

            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The trial was formally an appeal against the admission by Mr Lynch’s trustee in bankruptcy of a proof of debt of Aldermore Bank (“the Bank”). The proof was based on a guarantee dated 12 September 2011 of debts of Mr Lynch’s company, Ruskin Private Hire Limited (“Ruskin”), allegedly signed by Mr Lynch (“the Guarantee”). Mr Lynch disputed the Bank’s debt on the basis that he did not sign the Guarantee. The Judge allowed the appeal and reversed the trustee’s decision to admit the proof.</p>

            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Ruskin had gone into creditors’ voluntary liquidation on 12 February 2015, following a winding up petition of HMRC presented in August 2013.  Mr Lynch was made bankrupt by order of 12 March 2015.  </p>

            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Judge heard evidence from several witnesses over 5 days, including Mr Lynch himself and Ms Hughes, who appeared to have witnessed Mr Lynch’s signature on the Guarantee but who disputed having done so. There were witnesses called by the Bank: Mr Broomhead and Mr Adcock of the Bank, and a Mr Bramwell, whose company had been involved in providing finance to Ruskin or Mr Lynch.  </p>

            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Judge also read an unchallenged joint expert report of a handwriting expert, Dr Radley. Dr Radley’s opinion was that the Guarantee was not signed by Mr Lynch but that it was signed by Ms Hughes, who appended her name and address to it.</p>

            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Judge found that documentary evidence from the Bank’s records did not prove that the Guarantee was provided to Mr Lynch for him to sign. He ultimately accepted the evidence of Mr Lynch and Ms Hughes that they had not been given a guarantee to sign and did not sign it.  Indeed, he found that the document had never left the Bank, so Mr Lynch and Ms Hughes could not have signed it.  The Judge felt unable to accept Dr Radley’s opinion that Ms Hughes had signed and appended her name and address to the Guarantee, but he accepted his evidence that Mr Lynch did not sign it. </p>

            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Despite the proceedings being in the form of an appeal against a trustee in bankruptcy’s admission of a proof, the court had previously directed that statements of case be exchanged.  Mr Lynch filed Points of Claim in which he alleged that both his and Ms Hughes’ signatures on the Guarantee were forgeries, and that it was to be inferred that the perpetrator of the forgery was an officer, employee or other agent of the Bank.</p>

            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Bank’s case, in its Points of Defence, was that Mr Lynch <span style="font-style:italic">or his agent</span> had signed the Guarantee on 12 September 2011, which was the day that the documents were said to have been brought to Ruskin’s offices; and that 3 days later Mr Lynch <span style="font-style:italic">or his agent</span> delivered the Guarantee to Tracey Court of the Bank when she visited Ruskin’s offices.  The Bank had alternative cases: first that, if Mr Lynch did not sign, he authorised someone else to sign and that person did so; second, that he was estopped from denying the validity of the Guarantee because he or his agent delivered the Guarantee to the Bank apparently bearing his signature.</p>

            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Mr Ian Wilson KC and Ms Sarah Parker on behalf of the Appellant argued that, in view of the alternative cases pleaded by the Bank, the Judge had to decide not just whether Mr Lynch signed the Guarantee but also on which side (the Bank’s side or the Ruskin side) the signatures had been appended, if Mr Lynch did not sign it.  However, they criticise the Judge’s finding that Mr Lynch’s signature was signed by a person at the Bank.</p>

          <paragraph eId="para_10">

            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In substance, the 6-day hearing proceeded as a trial of the issues identified in the pleadings. The skeleton arguments, list of issues and the transcript of the opening submissions at the trial establish that the Judge was not simply required to decide whether Mr Lynch signed the Guarantee, but also whether someone else authorised by Mr Lynch did so, by emulating his signature, and whether he knowingly caused a guarantee apparently bearing his signature to be delivered to the Bank.  </p>
            </content>
          </paragraph>
          <paragraph eId="para_11">
            <num>11.</num>
            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">However, as Mr Wilson accepted, as the evidence unfolded, the fundamental factual question in the trial was whether the guarantee document reached Ruskin at all. If it did not, it could not have been signed by Mr Lynch or anyone else on the Ruskin side on his behalf, which would dispose of the three ways in which the Bank put its case.</p>
            </content>
          </paragraph>
          <paragraph eId="para_12">
            <num>12.</num>
            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">What was not for determination was who forged the signatures of Mr Lynch and Ms Hughes, if forgeries they were.  Despite Mr Lynch’s pleaded allegations of forgery, that question was unnecessary for the determination of any of the alternative cases on which the Bank relied to establish the validity of its proof. Mr Knight, representing Mr Lynch at trial, confirmed in opening that he was not asking the Judge to infer that the Bank forged the guarantee.  </p>
            </content>
          </paragraph>
          <paragraph eId="para_13">
            <num>13.</num>
            <content>
              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">There was much written in the skeleton arguments for this appeal about where the burden of proof lay at trial.  It seemed to be accepted at trial that the burden lay on Mr Lynch to prove, by cogent evidence, that his signature had been forged, and Mr Lynch was treated as the claimant at the trial.  Mr McCormick KC and Mr Kwok, for Mr Lynch on this appeal, do not accept that the burden did lie on Mr Lynch. They say that the Bank had to prove the basis of its proof of debt and the Judge did not have to decide an allegation of forgery.  </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">However, nothing in the Judge’s judgment ultimately turned on where the legal or evidential burden of proof lay, despite the way that he expressed some of his conclusions being capable of being read as relating to burden of proof. Both sides called witnesses and relied on documents in the agreed bundles. The Judge was satisfied, having heard all the evidence and read the relevant documents, that neither Mr Lynch nor anyone else on the Ruskin side received or signed the Guarantee.  Equally, the Bank does not suggest on this appeal that any reasonable judge would have decided the case in its favour by falling back on the burden or standard of proof when unable to decide the probabilities of the matter. It contends that any reasonable judge would have decided, when weighing all the evidence, that the Guarantee was probably signed by Mr Lynch and witnessed by Ms Hughes. The alternative way that it puts its case is that the Judge’s analysis of parts of the evidence was so flawed that his conclusion cannot stand.</p>

These had been provided through the Royal Bank of Scotland’s subsidiaries (“RBS”), but Ruskin got caught up in RBS’s Global Recoveries Group’s activities in 2008 and sought to find alternative funding.  When an attempt to obtain funding from National Westminster Bank failed, Mr Lynch turned to two independent consultants, Mr Goodrich and Mr Dartford, who introduced Mr Bramwell of Inspiration Finance plc (“Inspiration”) to Ruskin in March 2011.  Mr Bramwell liked the Ruskin business and considered investing himself.  Inspiration did make loans to Ruskin (or Mr Lynch) in the summer of 2011.  Mr Bramwell also set up meetings between Ms Hughes, who was the financial controller of Ruskin, and officers of the Bank.</p>

However, Mr Clark met Mr Lynch on 29 July 2011, as a result of which the Bank started to look more favourably on Ruskin.  What was said in that meeting in relation to a guarantee that the Bank would require from Mr Lynch was disputed at trial.  Mr Lynch said that it was indicated that a limited guarantee of up to £150,000 might possibly be required; the Bank said that it would have required an unlimited guarantee.  Mr Clark was not called to give evidence.  </p>

Credit committee approval was given on the basis of an unlimited guarantee. However there was in evidence no document sent by the Bank to Ruskin or Mr Lynch that states that an unlimited guarantee would be required.</p>

It then made an offer of a facility of £1,000,000 to Ruskin on 2 September 2011.  This referred to a requirement for a guarantee and indemnity from Mr Lynch “in our standard format”. There were then meetings between Mr Lynch and Mr Bramwell and others on 5 and 8 September 2011 to discuss the offer. Inspiration provided some funding. At some stage, a revised offer was received from the Bank on essentially the same terms, also dated 2 September 2011.  It is admitted by Mr Lynch that he signed the revised offer on behalf of Ruskin.</p>

The signature in his name therefore cannot have been on a blank document, and neither of the signatures can have been cut and pasted from another document onto the Guarantee.</p>

Two internal documents in particular were relied on, the contents of which no witness called by the Bank was able to explain in detail. The first is headed “Take-On Checklist” and contains many lines and check boxes relating to the setting up and administration of Ruskin’s facility. The second is a version of pages 2-3 of the revised offer letter, setting out the conditions of the facility, on which someone had written “Preliminary conditions Ruskin Private Hire Ltd” and made various markings (“the Preliminary Checklist”). There was also a third unidentified document headed “Deal Outline”.  It will be necessary to consider those documents in more detail later.</p>

It also called evidence from Mr Bramwell of Inspiration to the effect that, at a detailed discussion on 8 September 2011, Mr Lynch acknowledged that he was required to enter into an unlimited guarantee.</p>

Later in the same witness statement, he acknowledged a dispute about the authenticity of the Guarantee and stated that he believed his signature had been forged and was either copied and pasted from another Bank document that he did sign or somehow imposed on the Guarantee.

These documents were not put to any witness because the authors of those documents had not been called. In consequence, the evidence about the documents, their meaning, the date and circumstances in which they came to be created could not be tested. As an example Mr Mills took me to what he called a “preliminary checklist” which was not put to any witness. It included ticks by numbered paragraphs. Three paragraphs had a circle around the number and a tick. Mr Mills submitted that it was permissible to infer that the author (who was not disclosed) had first circled the matters that required doing before the Bank could be satisfied that the conditions for lending had been satisfied. After they were satisfied, a tick was applied. One such matter concerns the Guarantee.</p>

They may have been circled for other reasons. It is known that the Bank was not satisfied about the relevant licences, certificates and accreditations until 14 September 2011, yet the “Take-On” document included prior dates (12 September 2011). There is no explanation as to why there would be a shadow document tracking documents: casting further doubt on the evidential weight of the “Take-On Checklist”. Mr Mills submitted that the handwriting was that of Ms Court. Her unsigned witness summary explains her working practice and contradicts the submission made by Mr Mills. In the summary, she says that she “relied heavily” on the Take-On Checklist. She does not mention a shadow document. The method she used for outstanding matters to be dealt with, was to mark them with an asterisk and then cross the asterisk out once satisfied. In the absence of cross-examination where the documentary record could be examined, the court is left with accepting that Mr Mills’ interpretation of facts as possible, but that is not the same as drawing a proper inference of fact. I declined his invitation to do so.”</p>

An email dated 12 September attaches the Robust Guarantee and Robust board minutes for execution. As this was considered to be a sufficient method of conveyance for the Robust guarantee it is unlikely that it would not be sufficient for the Guarantee. This is particularly so since it was the Bank’s practice to ensure that a prospective guarantor had time to take legal advice and consider the seriousness of entering such a guarantee. No proper explanation was proffered at trial by any witness. Although emailing the Guarantee did not necessarily exclude personal carriage, in the absence of evidence from Mr Adcock that he did deliver the Guarantee personally, it is more likely than not that a similar method would have been used to convey the Guarantee: no such email exists. Mr Adcock did not review the documents he took to the offices and could not recall which documents were taken. The evidence is confused about whether it was sent by post. It can be said with some degree of confidence that there is no evidence of posting and no party to the proceedings has found an email with the Guarantee attached. The evidence supports a finding that the documents taken to the Ruskin office on 12 September were corporate only.</p>

In some ways it is an extraordinary position to take as there is no evidence that she did so. There is no doubt she did collect some documents: those taken by Mr Adcock on 12 September 2011. In these circumstances the court is asked to make a series of inferences to make good the Bank’s position based on the Bank’s normal practice, emails and internal documents. </p>

That is not to say that an adverse inference should be drawn from their absence. Ms Court, for example, was not prepared to provide sworn evidence. It is beyond argument that the court does not have the benefit of this evidence and Mr Lynch is prevented from testing these potential witnesses of fact by reference to the key events in which they were involved, and the documents Ms Court in particular produced. This, in my judgment, reduces the weight the court can properly put on the untested documents.”</p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The right approach to a suggestion that a trial judge was wrong to make a finding of fact is set out in a number of important recent decisions of the Court of Appeal. Mr Wilson accepted that the Bank is required on this appeal to establish that no reasonable judge could have made the finding that is under attack, or (which amounts to the same thing) that it is rationally insupportable. </p>

                      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">“The approach which an appellate court should take when asked to reverse the judge’s findings of fact has been addressed in a number of recent cases. These are conveniently summarised in the <span style="font-style:italic">Group Seven</span> case under the heading of “Appellate restraint”,  at paras 21–23. I need not repeat that summary, which emphasises the advantages which the trial judge, immersed in all aspects of the case and able to test the evidence at first had, has over this court where the focus is inevitably narrower, and emphasises also the principle that this court should not interfere unless satisfied that a finding of fact is plainly wrong. However I would add a reference to <span style="font-style:italic">Volcafe Ltd v Cia Sud Americana de Vapores SA (trading as CSAV)</span> [2018] UKSC 61; [2019] AC 358, at paragraph 41, on which Mr Paul McGrath QC for Ikon particularly relied. Lord Sumption said:</p>

                        <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:1in;margin-right:0.39in">‘this court has on a number of occasions pointed out that while an appeal to the Court of Appeal is by way of rehearing, a trial judge’s findings of fact should not be overturned simply because the Court of Appeal would have found them differently. It must be shown that the trial judge was wrong, i.e. that he fundamentally misunderstood the issue or the evidence, or that he plainly fails to take the evidence into account, or that he arrived at a conclusion which the evidence could not on any view support. Within these broad limits, the weight of the evidence is a matter for the trial judge. There is a world of difference between the impression which evidence makes on a judge who has followed it as it was deployed and the impression that an appellate court derives from cold transcripts.’.</p>

                      <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.79in;margin-right:0.39in">At some points in his submissions Mr Stephen Hofmeyr QC for the appellants invited us to reverse the judge’s findings of fact. In particular he invited us to find that Mr Jagannah was dishonest, contrary to the judge’s finding that he was not, and to remit the case for a retrial with that issue already determined. That struck me as an unrealistic approach. Once it is acknowledged, as Mr Hofmeyr does acknowledge, that a retrial is necessary, I consider that we should not tie the hands of the judge who will retry the case. Accordingly I do not propose that we should reverse the judge’s findings, in the sense of replacing them with findings of our own. That being so, the approach described in the <span style="font-style:italic">Group Seven</span> case and in the <span style="font-style:italic">Volcafe </span>case is not directly applicable, although clearly it must be borne in mind as constituting the framework within which this court must operate. Rather the issue is whether the judge gave adequate reasons for his conclusions. In that regard it will be necessary to consider in particular whether, in Lord Sumption’s words, the judge ‘plainly fails to take the evidence into account’. To the same effect, Lord Reed referred in <span style="font-style:italic">Henderson v Foxworth Investments Ltd</span> [2014] UKSC 41; [2014] 1 WLR 2600, at para 67, to ‘a demonstrable failure to consider relevant evidence…’”.</p>

He observed that in her handwritings there are numerous idiosyncratic features, both in respect of individual forms and joining strokes between the letterforms. He concluded that, given the number and nature of similarities, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary he was of the opinion that Ms Hughes wrote her name and address on the Guarantee, and that the likelihood of some other individual copying the details could realistically be disregarded.</p>

The signature, like the signature of Mr Lynch, fell into category 3 in the appendix: strong evidence giving rise to high confidence, despite the restriction on the volume of comparable signatures in Ms Hughes’s case. The handwriting of Ms Hughes, however, fell into category 1: absolute or conclusive opinion, because Dr Radley says that the likelihood of some other individual copying that writing could realistically be disregarded, which is the corollary of an absolute or conclusive opinion being expressed. </p>

It is unclear from the transcript of evidence whether, in identifying differences in the r-i-o-n of her first name, Ms Hughes was pointing to the disputed signature or the disputed handwriting. In any event, it is clear that the Judge thought that the qualification that Dr Radley expressed in relation to his level of confidence about Ms Hughes applied generally, and not just to the signature. </p>

When summarising Dr Radley’s conclusions at para 11 of the judgment, the Judge did not refer to the conclusion about Ms Hughes’ handwriting. Further, although Dr Radley expressed his conclusion about Ms Hughes’ handwriting as being “in the absence of any evidence to the contrary”, the say so of Ms Hughes would not be the kind of evidence that a handwriting expert had in mind. It is not credible to suggest (and Mr McCormick did not) that Dr Radley would have failed to study any of the letters in the disputed signature and handwriting when comparing them to the authentic samples. By “evidence to the contrary”, Dr Radley must have had in mind other evidence that tends to support an alternative explanation. </p>

His reasons for concluding that Ms Hughes’ evidence was to be preferred to that of Dr Radley were not supported by the undisputed evidence. I have some sympathy with the Judge, in that this point was not flagged up by (different) Counsel then acting for the Bank in the way that Mr Wilson has done before me. The separate finding of Dr Radley relating to the handwriting of Ms Hughes was, however, identified in the opening submissions of Counsel for Mr Lynch and in the Bank’s opening skeleton argument at trial (para 70(3)), and obliquely referred to in its written closing submissions.  It would therefore not be right to prevent the Bank from taking the point on appeal.</p>

The Judge reached his conclusion about the validity of the Guarantee on the basis that the relevant document had probably never left the Bank and so was not provided to anyone on the Ruskin side. He concluded, at para 85 of his judgment, that, logically, the disputed signature must therefore have been made by a person at the Bank. That is a strong finding to make – and one to which the Bank takes exception, given that the issue of who forged the Guarantee was agreed not to be a live issue at trial. If Dr Radley’s conclusion at the highest level of confidence about Ms Hughes’ handwriting is correct, the document must have left the Bank and been received by Ms Hughes at least. </p>

That potentially calls into question the conclusion about whether Mr Lynch signed the Guarantee, albeit (ironically) Dr Radley expressed a strong conclusion that he did not.  It also reopens for decision the alternative cases of the Bank, namely that someone authorised by Mr Lynch signed the Guarantee in his name, or that he knowingly delivered the Guarantee that apparently bore his signature, both of which the factual findings of the Judge had closed off, as they were impossible if the document had never reached the Ruskin side. </p>

This is not a case where a judge who did not hear the relevant witnesses can substitute a different overall conclusion for that of the Judge. </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The gravamen of this ground of appeal is that although the Judge gave himself an impeccable <span style="font-style:italic">Gestmin </span>direction, he failed to apply it because he gave greater weight to the oral testimony of Mr Lynch and Ms Hughes than to the Bank’s documents and other documents, and failed to have regard to the inherent improbability of the conclusion that he reached, namely that someone at the Bank forged Mr Lynch’s signature on the Guarantee between 15 and 20 September 2011.  The Bank argues that the Judge should have had greater regard to the documents and the inherent likelihood of either side’s case being correct than to flawed recollections of what happened over ten years ago.</p>

However, it is not my role to make a fresh decision about what is proved and which evidence should be preferred. The weight to be given to any particular evidence was a matter for the Judge. To allow the appeal on this ground I need to be satisfied that the Judge was wrong in principle in his evaluation of the evidence or reached a conclusion that no reasonable judge would have reached.  </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The starting point is to identify the issues to which any of the evidence was relevant.  The critical factual issues on which the outcome of the trial turned were whether Mr Lynch and Ms Hughes signed the Guarantee, and whether the document that became the Guarantee was sent or taken by someone on the Bank side to someone on the Ruskin side on about 12 September 2011.  The latter issue was of importance to the disposal of the Bank’s alternative cases.</p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The oral testimony of Mr Lynch and Ms Hughes about whether they signed the Guarantee was obviously important in a case of this nature, as was the Judge’s view of whether each was a credible witness.  Given the serious allegations made by Mr Lynch, a finding that he was unreliable or not frank and honest would be liable to have a significant bearing on the decision. A finding that he appeared to be reliable and honest would lend support to Dr Radley’s evidence that the signature was not Mr Lynch’s.  However, the Judge needed to be cautious in evaluating the reliability of the witnesses, given the length of time between the events in dispute and the trial. </p>

In such cases, where there is a reliable documentary record of emails between the parties, minutes and notes, it is clear and now understood that the picture presented by the documentary record is likely to be much more reliable that the participants’ imperfect recollections at a significant distance of time.  </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In this case, the two factual questions were of a different kind.  Given the allegation of forgery, the question of whether Mr Lynch and Ms Hughes signed the Guarantee was not going to be resolved by the key documents that were in evidence.  There was no document sending the Guarantee to anyone on the Ruskin side for Mr Lynch to sign, and the Guarantee was disputed.  The issue of whether the Guarantee document had left the Bank and arrived at Ruskin depended on the reliability of the evidence of Mr Broomhead, whose statement said that it would have been posted to Ruskin (though there was no documentary record of posting), and Mr Adcock, whose statement said that he took the Guarantee with him to Ruskin on 12 September 2011, as well as on the Bank’s internal documents. Two key witnesses, Ms Court and Mr Atkinson, who went to Ruskin on 15 September 2011 to verify debt and collect the signed documentation, were not called to give evidence.</p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">There can be no doubt that the Bank’s internal documents and the emails of 14 September 2011 were admissible evidence on which the Bank was entitled to rely.  The documents in the bundle proved their contents and so were some evidence of what the Bank had done in relation to the Ruskin transaction.  They did not have to have been seen at the time by the Ruskin side or put to Mr Lynch to be admissible, if they were relied on as evidence of what the Bank had done internally as opposed to in conjunction with My Lynch. But, importantly, the Judge had to decide what those documents themselves proved and how reliable they were. Having done that, he had to decide what if any inferences of fact could be drawn from the facts established by the documents. </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Judge found the documentary record to be incomplete and inadequate: in his judgment he identified a number of missing entries and signatures. Further, what the documents appeared to record was inconsistent in certain respects with the Bank’s case.  No one was called by the Bank who could explain the markings or entries on the Take-On Checklist or the Preliminary Checklist.  That was not a matter of oral testimony being needed simply to prove the documents; it was a case of testimony being needed to explain what various entries or markings meant, where they were not self-explanatory, and who made them and when, where that was not stated on the face of the documents.  </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In short, there was a live question about what the documents proved, and what if any inferences could be drawn from them.  The Judge had to weigh such oral evidence as there was explaining the nature of the documents with what they stated, and decide whether the documents proved that the Guarantee document was either sent or taken to Ruskin on 12 September 2011, or whether that could safely be inferred from what the documents recorded. Mr Mills, on behalf of the Bank in closing submissions invited the Judge to infer that circles and ticks on the Preliminary Checklist signified that Ms Court had first identified that something was outstanding and then marked the document again when it was done or obtained; and that a tick meant that the condition in question had been adequately complied with.  Unsurprisingly, the Judge was unwilling to draw that inference in the absence of some evidence about who created the document, when and for what purpose, and who made the manuscript markings on it and what the markings signified.  </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Judge expressed his dissatisfaction with the Bank’s evidence in support of its case in various ways. There were important witnesses who were not called; witnesses who were called were unreliable; and the documentary record was incomplete and unexplained.  His conclusions about the documentary evidence were expressed in paras 44 to 47 of the judgment, set out above.  Mr Wilson criticised the way that the Judge expressed his conclusions, and said that it assumed that the onus was on the Bank to disprove a forgery; but the issue for me is whether in substance the Judge approached the documentary evidence in a way that a reasonable judge could have done, not whether he expressed himself felicitously in explaining his conclusions.</p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">In my judgment, what the Judge concluded in substance was this. There were no documents, internal or external, that were reliable evidence that the Guarantee document went from the Bank side to the Ruskin side on 12 September 2011 or on any day, given the limitations of the documentary record and the absence of any explanation of what certain documents meant. Further, no inference to the effect that the Guarantee was delivered to Ruskin could properly be drawn from what the documents did prove. That, in my judgment, was a conclusion that was open to the Judge, given the evidential gaps in the Bank’s case based on the documents. </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The high point of the Bank’s argument was the markings on the Take-On Checklist and the emails exchanged between Ms Court, Ms Hughes and Mr Dartford on 14 September 2011. The Deal Outline was not identified or explained in evidence and does not by itself prove any relevant fact.</p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The Take-On Checklist is a complex document that appears to record the preparation and checking of documents for the transaction on 2 September 2011 (though there is no signature to attest this), and a check of completed documents and paperwork by Ms Court on 12 September 2011, apparently signed by her. It identifies an unlimited personal guarantee of Mr Lynch as one of the documents, and a “date sent out” for that (and all other documents) of 12 September 2011, and also being “signed by individual” and properly witnessed and dated on that same day. The form bears Mr Adcock’s name and a date of 12 September 2011 but he has not signed it off.  The form is signed in two places by Ms Court on 14 September. The checklist also bears Mr Broomhead’s name and a date of 19 September 2011, but not his signature.  It records copy documents sent to client on 19 September, but there was no other evidence of such documents having been sent or received.  </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">The statement that the Guarantee was signed, witnessed and dated 12 September 2011 is therefore inconsistent with Mr Adcock’s written evidence that he took all the documents to Ruskin on 12 September and left them for Mr Lynch to consider, and that Ms Court and Mr Atkinson collected them on 15 September. It is also inconsistent with the 14 September email from Ms Court to Ms Hughes, which stated that a dated and signed guarantee of Mr Lynch was outstanding and needed to be satisfied by Friday 16 September. Since Ms Court signed off the checklist on 14 September, the day before she collected documents from Ruskin, it is unclear how she could have certified due signature and witnessing of the Guarantee on 12 September.</p>

They show that Ms Court identified the Guarantee and an asset and liability statement as being outstanding conditions, and that Mr Dartford annotated the email from Ms Court to state that Ms Court would pick them up the next day. Mr Lynch was copied into Mr Dartford’s reply. There was no email response from Mr Lynch.  </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Mr Dartford’s email is evidence of his understanding about what would happen and his being involved in some way with Ruskin’s arrangements to secure its facility.  Whether his understanding about the Guarantee and the assets and liability statement was correct or mistaken is unknown, as Mr Dartford was not called to give evidence (the assets and liability statement was in fact only faxedon behalf of Mr Lynch to the Bank on 16 September, not – apparently – collected by Ms Court on 15 September). The email is relied on by the Bank as evidence that a document of guarantee had previously been sent by the Bank to Ruskin. But that is an inference that depends on Mr Dartford’s level of involvement between 12 and 14 September, whether he had reviewed the suite of documents brought by Mr Adcock and verified the contents, and whether Mr Lynch saw and read the annotations to Ms Court’s email, among other things. Mr Dartford did not give evidence.  There was therefore, again, a gap in the evidential basis for the Bank’s submission.    </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">This is, in my view, a case where the contemporaneous documents were arguably insufficiently probative of the facts that the Bank sought to establish, not a case where there was a reliable documentary record of what happened.  It is apparent from the way that the judgment is structured that the Judge did not first decide which oral testimony he accepted before considering whether any of the documents altered his conclusion: he addressed the shortcomings of the documents, alongside some of the evidence, in the “Background” section of the judgment, reaching conclusions at paras 44-47. He only then turned to the live witnesses and gave his reasons for either accepting their testimony or being cautious about it.  All the strands except one are then brought together in the section headed “Execution of the Guarantee”, where the Judge weighs them up.  </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">Where the Judge says at para 81 that he found that Mr Lynch and Ms Hughes were honest (and in Ms Hughes’ case, impressive) witnesses and that “It is from those findings that I reach my conclusions”, that has to be read as a way of expressing a conclusion about all the evidence (except Dr Radley’s evidence, to which the Judge later turned) and not merely, as the Bank would have it, after considering the oral evidence.  Given the particular circumstances of this case, the weight to be given to oral testimony as against whatever the documents did prove was a matter for the Judge.</p>

Inherent probability of one or other side’s factual account being correct is a valuable and important consideration in a case where fraud or forgery is alleged.  It was particularly important in this case because the Judge’s factual conclusions meant that he felt impelled to say that the signature of Mr Lynch was appended by a person at the Bank.  A finding of forgery carried out by an employee of a reputable company is a serious finding to make (particularly when the parties had agreed that there was no requirement to make it). </p>

Speaking from my own experience, I have found it essential in cases of fraud, when considering the credibility of witnesses, always to test the veracity by reference to the objective facts proved independently of their testimony, in particular by reference to the documents in the case, and also to pay particular regard to their motives and to the overall probabilities. It is frequently very difficult to tell whether a witnesses telling the truth or not; and where there is a conflict of evidence such as there was in the present case, reference to the objective facts and documents, to the witnesses motives, and the overall probabilities, can be a very great assistance to a judge in ascertaining truth. I have been driven to the conclusion that the judge did not pay sufficient regard to these matters in making his findings of fact in the present case.”</p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">A judge does not have to deal expressly in a judgment with every issue and argument raised. It can usually safely be inferred that, without referring to them expressly, a judge had all the evidence and submissions in mind. I am left in doubt, however, whether the Judge did carry out the essential step described by Robert Goff LJ. I have re-read the judgment to try to find reassurance that the Judge did stand back and consider inherent probabilities. There is nothing to indicate that he did. The Judge’s finding that the signature was made by a person at the Bank was said to follow “logically” from the conclusion that the Guarantee was never provided to Mr Lynch (para 85). That suggests that the Judge did not do so.    </p>

              <p style="text-align:justify;margin-left:0.39in">I accept that this is not a case where the documents point forcefully against the Judge’s conclusion, but what is nevertheless missing is consideration of why someone at the Bank may have acted in that way, within such a short timescale, when the Bank had a contractual right to a guarantee. There was only one day between the first drawdown on the facility and the Guarantee being uploaded. It is hard to imagine why the signatures would have been forged before drawdown. The Judge would also have had to consider whether, if Mr Lynch did not sign his name, someone else on the Ruskin side might have done so and had a reason to do so. The Judge may have been deflected from that course because of his conclusion that the Guarantee did not leave the Bank, but it was right nevertheless to have tested his conclusion of forgery at the Bank by reference to that possibility.  </p>

There are too many evidential points at play in this case, some of which conflict. A final conclusion could only be made by a judge who heard the witness evidence.  Nevertheless, the decision that the Judge reached is flawed because it does not appear that he considered the essential matters identified by Robert Goff LJ.  </p>

They could not be relied on as evidence of propensity because there had been no finding, nor was there an attempt to prove, that Mr Lynch had in fact received the documents in question or that the Inspiration loan agreement was genuine, or that the other serious allegations were unfounded.  What could be said was accordingly not that Mr Lynch had made false allegations previously but that it was inherently unlikely that Mr Lynch could be the victim of so many mischances as he suggested was the case, in particular of two separate forgeries in the same month relating to Ruskin’s financing arrangements; and, therefore, it was unlikely that he was being truthful about the execution of the Guarantee.</p>

The Judge was right to see them as an attempt to persuade him that Mr Lynch was dishonest, but without proving that there had been previous occasions of dishonesty.  The Judge was entitled to be cautious about that approach; I would say he was right to be cautious.  The second allegation of forgery might have been regarded as being of particular interest but, as with much similar fact evidence, there is a danger that a judge becomes distracted by matters that are not directly in issue. It might indeed have been unlikely that Mr Lynch had been defrauded twice by different persons, but without a finding about the Inspiration loan agreement that of itself would not assist the Judge to decide whether the Guarantee was forged.</p>

There was no procedural irregularity. The point emerged in the course of the Bank’s cross-examination at trial. The Bank’s Counsel would have been aware that the point had not been identified previously by Mr Lynch or Ms Hughes and could have challenged the evidence on that basis.  If the Bank needed time to consider the point, or examine other documents or seek further disclosure, it could have done so at the trial.  It is not permissible for the Bank to raise the complaint on appeal.  The weight, if any, to be given to that evidence was a matter for the Judge, in the light of the way that the evidence was given and his evaluation of Ms Hughes and the witnesses generally.  Some, or many, judges may have been unimpressed by it, but it cannot be said that the Judge’s acceptance of that evidence was irrational.</p>

The reference to the content of that witness statement was admissible double hearsay, if the letter was in the bundle, though no notice had been given under the Civil Evidence Act 1995 in relation to the witness statement, so the Judge was perfectly entitled to conclude that it had little weight. Others might have concluded that it had none, but that is irrelevant. There is no indication that the little weight that the Judge thought it could bear had any impact on his decision, even though he pointed out that his conclusion that neither Mr Lynch nor Ms Hughes signed the Guarantee was consistent with what Mr Dartford had said.  </p>

The Judge referred to “memory bias” in the course of closing submissions, and considered that Mr Bramwell’s evidence was affected by it, sc. that the Bank’s standard guarantee was an unlimited guarantee. But memory bias is hardly a novel proposition or a matter that would have taken the Bank’s Counsel at trial by surprise.  The argument that the two psychologists should have been called as expert witnesses before the Judge could refer to their work was very surprising.  There is nothing in the judgment to suggest that the Judge relied on anything beyond what has previously been discussed in authorities and what is now commonplace in a trial.</p>

The Judge was well aware that Mr Lynch, in his 2014 witness statements, had given a different explanation of his dealings with the Bank, namely that he probably signed a limited guarantee. He referred to it in his judgment. It cannot seriously be suggested that the Judge must have overlooked the fact that Mr Lynch did not initially dispute that he had signed a guarantee.</p>

Whether Mr Lynch would have signed an unlimited guarantee, had one been sent or brought to Ruskin, was not in the event a question that the Judge had to decide.  The Judge nowhere concluded that a guarantee document was not sent because the Bank recognised that a limited guarantee of the kind that Mr Lynch described had no value.</p>

The Judge expressed a view in his judgment that a bank should bring the terms of a guarantee to a guarantor’s notice, particularly if the guarantee is unlimited.  The Bank suggests that this disagreement, based on the Judge’s views about good banking practice, led to a rejection of Mr Bramwell’s evidence on the basis that it was a “reconstruction”.  I consider that the Judge’s comment on banking practice was little more than a comment (perhaps an unnecessary one) and did not affect his conclusion about whether there was a discussion on 8 September 2011 about an unlimited guarantee. Neither did the Judge’s view about good banking practice affect his assessment of whether Mr Lynch or Mr Bramwell was right to recall what sort of guarantee was discussed on that day. Mr Bramwell’s reconstruction was said to follow from his own views of what was standard practice. </p>

Nor is it at all clear how a failure to reach the contrary conclusion (viz that Mr Lynch had misremembered based on later use of the expression) contaminated the Judge’s decision on the central factual issues, which did not depend on anything that was said at the July 2011 meeting.  </p>
