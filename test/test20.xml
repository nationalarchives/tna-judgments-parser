It does not seek to invalidate the Match Marks but argues that its activities do not infringe.

For example, the “Objectives” listed on p.5 were to (1) “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Follow the development of the Match’s brands and of its competitors</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”; (2) “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Evaluate the performance of Match’s latest advertising campaigns</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">” and (3) “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">measure the impact of Match’s recent Match Making brand launches</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">…”. Then, at pp.10-12, the 2010 report stated that its “Main Findings” were: “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Awareness: Match is the clear leader</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”; “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Match has a large leadership in terms of awareness</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">…”; “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Match has one of the market’s strongest image</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">…”; “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Match users’ satisfaction is only at an average level</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”; and “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Match is the brand with the strongest growth potential</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”. Similarly, in its “Recommendations” (p.13), the 2010 report noted that: “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Match now has the market’s strongest level of awareness and needs to nourish this brand with content</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”, and that “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">As market leader, Match will be the first brand to benefit from this market growth</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”. Whilst the report makes some use of the name “match.com”, this was confined to the various tables and to the footer of the title pages for the report’s sections, where it used the match.com logo (as shown in paragraph 18 above).</span></p>

He referred to its investment in TV advertising, outdoor posters, radio advertisements, inserts for print magazines, PR, social media and digital advertising. Insofar as he referred to events or matters from the time before he joined Match in April 2012, he asserted (and I accept) that what he says is consistent with his knowledge of the Match business and its documents and, given the evidential constraints inherent in this being a 2 day IPEC trial, I can see no reason to doubt the accuracy of his evidence in this regard.</span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Mr Riviere’s evidence, which I accept, was that in 2010, spending on TV advertising for Match in the UK was an estimated £4,936,000 (28% of the total spend in the whole dating category and not including the further £4,779,000 spent on Match Affinity). In 2011, the TV advertising spend for Match.com alone was £6,759,000 (31%) (again, not including the £2,844,000 spent in respect of Match Affinity). In 2012 it was £8,551,000 (52%). The sums, whilst estimates, suggest that Match funded extensive advertising and I do not accept Ms Bowhill’s comment that such evidence was meaningless. Indeed, as mentioned above, the TNS reports from 2010 and 2011 both paid tribute to the success of Match’s advertising, and in particular to its TV advertising, in creating awareness of the Match brand. </span></p>

These advertisements would have had multiple views as they were aired on 240 or so digital and analogue television channels (including many that were accessible in the UK). They were also uploaded onto Match’s YouTube channel. I have been provided with copies of 26 of these advertisements. In 9 of them (including one called “Laces” from 2010 and others from 2012 to 2014) the voiceover (including those of purported customers) refers to “Match” as the source of the relevant dating services.</span><authorialNote class="footnote" marker="5"><p class="FootnoteText"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:9pt"> The 2010 advertisement was for Match Affinity and included the words </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:9pt">“If you’re looking to start a lasting relationship, our free affinity test can help you find someone on your </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:9pt">wave length. So take your first step now at Matchaffinity.com a different kind of relationship service from Match”</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';font-size:9pt">. The other 8 (post 2011) advertisements were part of the so-called “Real Members” TV campaign and featured real users of Match telling their own dating story in their own words and referring to the Claimants as “Match”. </span></p></authorialNote><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> The advertisements also used on-screen text to direct viewers to the “match.com” or “matchaffinity.com” websites for more details. Ms Bowhill commented that there was no evidence from those whose voices were used in the advertisements nor as to the circumstances in which these words came to be used. However, I see no reason to doubt that the words were those of actual users and, even if this were not the case, these advertisements still show how Match was choosing to project its brand to the public (as “Match” as well as “match.com”). Nor do I accept Ms Bowhill’s criticism that this is akin to survey/witness evidence for which no permission was given. None of this material was produced for the purposes of litigation. Instead, it was produced precisely in order to promote Match’s brand to the public and, accordingly, seems to me to be of significance.</span></p>

I do not have figures for Match’s followers on Twitter as at 2011 (although Mr Riviere’s evidence is that they had 103,000 and 14,000 followers respectively as at October 2021). However, Match’s YouTube channel which was created in December 2009 had had over 500,000 views as at 30 January 2012 (and over 6 million views by October 2021) whilst Match’s Facebook page at www.facebook.com/matchuk/ created in March 2010 had had over 6,000 page likes as at November 2011 (and 203,000 by October 2021). I note that the internet addresses for these forms of social media used the word “match” or “matchuk” or UKmatch” rather than “match.com”.</span></p>

Finally, Mr Riviere’s evidence was that, according to YouGov research from 2011, Match was the dating brand that was the source of most relationships and marriages.</span></p>

Mr Younas’ evidence was (and I accept) that he was a practising Muslim and wanted to provide a service that would allow Muslims to find a marriage partner in a way that was compatible with Islamic values. His concern was that for many Muslims, the only way to meet a marriage partner was through family contacts or intermediaries, a process which many Muslims found awkward and outdated. Whilst websites were being used by and were becoming more popular with some Muslims, many other Muslims disapproved of them, and in particular, of the more “mainstream Western” websites because they were perceived to allow or promote casual relationships rather than focussing on finding a marriage partner. Meanwhile, the only website then specifically targeted at the Muslim market was, in Mr Younas’ view, of very poor quality.</span></p>

They explained that, in the course of office banter between a group of colleagues at Morgan Stanley, various names had been suggested for dating services for different faith communities (including names such as IdoHindu, iJew, SeekSikh). In the course of this, someone (probably Mr Craig, but possibly Mr Younas himself) suggested “muzmatch” would be an appropriate name for the matchmaking services that Mr Younas was thinking of providing to the Muslim community. </span></p>

Mr Craig was stated that the group from Morgan Stanley had not discussed other existing dating sites on the market and had not carried out any research into names. In cross examination, Mr Austen sought to suggest that Mr Craig must have been aware of Match. However, I see no reason to doubt Mr Craig’s evidence. Mr Younas’ evidence was that he had heard of Match (as well as various other dating websites such as eHarmony, JDate, Shaadi, Jeevansathi, Bharat Matrimony and Single Muslim) and he was aware of it as a mainstream dating website. He said, however, that he was not thinking about Match when he chose “muzmatch” because, in his mind, the word “match” in this context described the service being provided (matchmaking) and linking it to the letters “muz” showed that those services were being directed at Muslims. Mr Younas liked the name because it carried a clear and simple message (a service that helped users find a Muslim match). In effect, the name “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">says on the tin what the service is for</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">” and was catchy and memorable. </span></p>

In this period, the name was used not only on the app itself but also in organic and (largely after 2017) in paid-for social media content promoting the app. These included two advertisements featuring a play on the words from well-known songs by Lionel Ritchie </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">“Halal!

Mr Younas’ evidence was that, in around January 2012, he put in place an SEO strategy copied from that used by the SingleMuslim.com dating website. He explained that the strategy involved making a list of some 5000 words or word combinations (referred to as “keywords”) that related in some way to Muslim marriage or Muslim matchmaking. A page, known as a landing page, was then created on the Muzmatch website for each of these keywords. These landing pages would be indexed by search engines, such as Google, so that a user who carried out a search using one of those keywords would be presented with search results which included a link which, if clicked on, took the user to the relevant landing page on Muzmatch’s website. Muzmatch accepts that the aim of its SEO strategy was to promote and increase visits to its website.</span></p>

Although the word “match” was not of itself a keyword, there were some 132 keywords that contained that word, including, for example, “match-muslim”, “muslimmatch”, “muslim-match” and “UK-muslim-match” with, sometimes, a country reference (e.g. Afghanistan or Albania, etc.). However, Mr Younas’ evidence (which I accept) was that in creating his list of keywords, he did not think about Match.com or the Match Group. He pointed out that if he had wished to mislead people or to suggest that Muzmatch was a Muslim version of the Match brand, he would have included “match.com” in the list, but he had not done that. I will return to this point later, but it is noteworthy that the list of keywords does include keywords such as Singlemuslim, Shaadi, SimplyMarry, Salaam Love and Asian Flames, which are the names of other dating or introduction websites.</span></p>

It does not appear that Mr Younas added any more keywords containing the word “match”. However, he did add “muslim-tinder”, “tinder” and “halal-tinder” as keywords. The word “tinder” was clearly not a word relating to or describing Muslim marriage or Muslim matchmaking. Indeed, as set out above, Muzmatch now accepts the use of such keywords infringed Match’s trade marks in the Tinder Marks. </span></p>

As Mr Austen pointed out, this data was available to Muzmatch (but not to Match) using the Google Analytics tool but it was not produced. In the absence of Google Analytics data, Match relied on a report from its own SEO agency (Clustaar) for the period starting in January 2017 and ending 25 September 2021. This report contained data obtained by use of the SEMRUSH tool. It shows the actual position (or ranking) that various links to Muzmatch’s website achieved when a search was carried out using the keywords in issue. Then, on the basis of that ranking, the report provided estimates of the volume of searches that would have been carried out in order to achieve that ranking and of how many of those searches would have resulted in the searcher clicking through to the relevant landing page on Muzmatch’s website. </span></p>

Given that achieving such click throughs was the entire purpose of the SEO strategy that Muzmatch operated for almost 10 years and given the absence of any evidence from Muzmatch on this issue, I see no reason not to accept these figures.</span></p>

On 26 January 2016, its representatives wrote to Muzmatch asserting that those activities infringed the 1996 Match.com Mark and the Match Device Mark (amongst other marks) and amounted to passing off. This led to without prejudice settlement discussions where the parties sought to agree terms on which, subject to an agreement on branding style, Muzmatch could continue to use the Muzmatch name. However, these discussions broke down in late 2016. Subsequently, from September 2017, the parties were involved in negotiations as to whether Match could buy Muzmatch. In the course of these negotiations, Match made four separate offers, all of which were rejected by Mr Younas and these negotiations ended in January 2019. </span></p>

I will return to this later. However, whatever the position during those discussions, by 2018, Match’s objection to Muzmatch’s use of the Muzmatch name was clear from its oppositions to applications made by Muzmatch to register that name as an EU and a UK trade mark. Those oppositions, based on the grounds that use of that name would give rise to a likelihood of confusion and would take unfair advantage of the reputation of the Match Marks, succeeded in the EU Intellectual Property Office’s Opposition Division on 19 January 2018 and in its Board of Appeal on 25 September 2018 and also in the UK Intellectual Property Office on 12 February 2020.</span></p>

It was not entirely clear to me whether the suggestion here was that the average consumer of Match’s services could not be a practising Muslim or whether that was simply a factor to bear in mind when assessing issues such as that of the likelihood of confusion. Either way, for the reasons set out below, I do not accept this argument. Nor do I accept Ms Bowhill’s submission in closing that </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">“the market for Muslim dating is a discrete and distinct one”</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">, if by that she meant that no Muslim would use Match’s services.</span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In the first place, I do not think that it is possible to put all practising Muslims into a single category and to say that they are “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">not the typical user of dating services</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”. To do so assumes a uniformity of views that does not exist. Mr Younas himself gave evidence regarding the huge diversity of views within Islam and this is reflected in the fact that Muzmatch itself asks users whether they are “very practising”, “moderately practising”, “practising” or “non-practising” Muslims and whether they “never”, “sometimes”, “usually” or “always” pray. Whilst it may be that some practising Muslims will not use dating services (indeed, as mentioned above, there seems to be a reasonably substantial number of Muslims who object even to Muzmatch’s Islamic-focused dating services on the basis that it is “haram”), other practising Muslims (as well as some non-practising Muslims) will use them. Further, whilst it is correct that (before its 2020 launch of Hawaya) Match had not specifically targeted the Muslim community, Mr Riviere’s evidence (which I accept) was that, in 2018 and 2019, Match had a reasonably large number of new registrants who identified themselves as Muslims when registering for its services. Although Match did not have records for the earlier years, I can see no reason why the position would have been any different then. Secondly, whilst it is true that Match’s services were not specifically targeted at Muslims, the fact is that they were not specifically targeted at </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">any</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> particular class or type of person (other than someone who is looking for a partner). The targeting of its services could reach (and in Mr Younas’ case clearly did reach) Muslims as well as non-Muslims. Accordingly, I find that the average consumer might be of any race, creed, age, sex or background.</span></p>

Ms Bowhill submitted (and I accept) that the level of attention paid by the average consumer of dating services is likely to be higher than for normal consumer items, not least because users of dating services have to provide a significant amount of personal (even highly personal) information and, as Mr Lubot accepted, need to trust the platform to which they are providing that information.</span></p>

To this end, Ms Bowhill referred to various differences between the Match Marks and the Muzmatch Signs based on one or more of the following factors - (a) the inclusion of “muz” or “Muslim” or “UK” or “United Kingdom” in the Signs, (b) the presence of “.com” in two of the Match Marks, (c) differences in the font or case (upper or lower) used, (d) the heart device used in Muzmatch’s signs until 2016 and (e) the butterfly device added by Muzmatch to its logos in 2016. </span></p>

Further, there is a clear oral similarity in that the average consumer is likely to emphasise the “match” part when enunciating the Match Marks and is likely to give the muz/muslim/UK element and the “match” element equal emphasis when enunciating the Muzmatch Signs (in effect reading them almost as separate words - “Muz Match” or “UK Muslim Match”). I also find that there is a clear conceptual similarity. The average consumer would perceive that the word “match” was being used as a brand, but would also see that it was a reference to the nature of the services (to find a match). Conceptually, the addition of “muz” or “muslim” or “UK” would be seen as merely restricting that same concept somewhat (to find a Muslim match in the UK). </span></p>

However, this does not prevent a clear visual and aural similarity arising from the common use of the word “match”. Further, I do not think that any great conceptual difference arises from the presence or absence of the “.com” element. The average consumer, whilst taking note of this element, is likely to take it to be a reference to the fact that the services are provided online and, therefore, to focus more on the “match” element of the mark.</span></p>

By contrast, a simple heart device was a feature of Muzmatch’s logos from as early as 2011 but was dropped in 2016 and was replaced by the butterfly device. Such devices would have no effect at all when the marks are being referred to orally. Visually and conceptually, the average consumer would notice the presence of the heart. However, given the nature of the services (to find a partner), the very simple way in which the heart was depicted, and the role of imperfect recollection, I do not think that the presence of the heart (or its absence) would significantly affect the assessment of similarity that the average consumer would make based on the common use of the word “match”.</span></p>

This is clear from the various branding and tracking reports. In my judgment, that distinctiveness and reputation also attached to the 2017 Match.com Mark from its filing date.</span></p>

Consistently with this, the evidence shows that, by April or May 2011, many people were referring to the business simply as “Match”, as can be seen from the branding and tracking reports, the responses of some people to the TOM awareness question posed for those reports and some of Match’s advertisements to which I have referred. Indeed, by 2011 Match was itself emphasising the “Match” element of its Mark (see paragraph 23 above). Another example of this can be seen on the page from the Match.com website dated 26 May 2010 which stated: “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Are you looking for matchaffinity.com? A different kind of relationship service from match</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”. Whilst this is referring to Match Affinity, it is a page from the main Match.com website referring to another service available from Match and, more importantly for present purposes, referring to itself simply as “match”.</span></p>

In many of these instances, the word was plainly being used descriptively. In others, it was part of the name of the service provider but, with two exceptions, there is no evidence that these service providers were trading in 2011. The exceptions were “Senior Match” and “Millionaire Match”. The 2021 Google Play descriptions of the apps for these entities quote prices in pounds sterling and state that they started trading before 2011. However, this is all that I know about them. I know nothing about the scale of their operations and, in particular, whether they were operating in the UK under those names as at 2011 (I note that the “developer” was, in both cases, said to be in California). Mr Lubot’s evidence was that Match had been active in opposing or obtaining limitations of around 180 third party applications for trade marks that included the word “match” but none pre-dated 2011 and only 7 were from 2011 (Match being successful in each of these cases in preventing registration of the word “match” for dating services). It appears, therefore, that use of “match” in a distinctive sense was not widespread in around April 2011, save by Match.</span></p>

However, that same search may also have been made if the keyword was used being distinctively – by someone looking for a Muslim partner on Match. Indeed, the fact that such use could be distinctive is implicit in Muzmatch’s admission of liability with regard to its use of Tinder as an SEO keyword. </span></p>

The difficulty with this is that I know nothing about Minder and its services, save that Mr Younas has said that it had copied a number of app features and it looked similar to the Muzmatch app. Otherwise, I have no evidence as to how Minder operated and I do not think that this evidence helps me in considering the likelihood of confusion arising from two businesses like Match and Muzmatch that are using similar names. </span></p>

However, as I have already found, by 2011 (and therefore as at 3 March 2015) the average consumer would have been aware that where the word “match” was used in a distinctive sense, it designated the services of Match, the Claimants (see paragraph 93(e) above). Of course, given Match’s dominant position in the market reflected in the levels of awareness summarised, its advertising and its social media following (see paragraphs 35-38 above), the Match Device Mark would rapidly have acquired its own distinctiveness and reputation in any event (including in the Muslim community) after 3 March 2015.</span></p>

In summary, by 2011 the 1996 Match.com Mark had established a very significant reputation in the market (which was also enjoyed by the 2017 Match.com Mark from its filing date), there is medium level of similarity between the Match.com Marks and the Muzmatch Signs, and there is either an identity or a reasonably high level of similarity between the parties’ goods/services.

As set out above, even by 2011, the 1996 Match.com Mark had a very strong reputation (which was also enjoyed by the 2017 Match.com mark from its filing date), including amongst members of the Muslim community. Match had invested very substantial sums in order to build that reputation and, as Mr Lubot stated, to build trust in its platform and to reduce any stigma that might attach to the use of online dating services. By using the name “muzmatch” in a way that created a link to the Match.com Marks (and particularly to do so in relation to identical or, at least, highly similar goods or services), Muzmatch was, in effect, taking some of the benefit of that reputation and of that investment and was doing so without paying for it.</span></p>

Indeed, I note that (as mentioned above) he did not use the word “match” by itself or “Match.com” as SEO keywords. However, I do not see that this assists Muzmatch. As I understand it, Mr Younas’ state of mind was based on his belief that the word “match” was descriptive. In my judgment, for the reasons I have already set out, whatever Mr Younas’ subjective intention or belief, the average consumer (including some who were Muslims) would not have seen the relevant use of the word “match” by either Match or Muzmatch as being descriptive and would instead have made a link between the Muzmatch Signs and the Match Marks. The objective effect, therefore, of the use of the Muzmatch Signs was that Muzmatch benefitted from the reputation of the Match Marks.</span></p>

Tinder’s services, being more clearly focussed on forming casual relationships, are likely to be more objectionable to traditional Islamic values than Match’s services. Yet Muzmatch was perfectly prepared to use the Tinder name. Indeed, in addition to its use as part of an SEO keyword, I have seen marketing material from Muzmatch describing itself as “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Way more than just a ‘Muslim tinder</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">” and interviews given by Mr Younas in which he said “</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">I took what was good from Tinder</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">”. </span></p>

The negotiations started with Match’s letter alleging that Muzmatch’s actions infringed the Match Marks and that was still Match’s position in 2018 when it successfully opposed Muzmatch’s applications to register the Muzmatch name as a trade mark (see paragraph 65 above). Muzmatch may have hoped that the negotiations would lead to a favourable result that would allow it to continue using the Muzmatch name, but I cannot see how this could convert the unfair advantage that Muzmatch had taken of the Match Marks into a fair advantage.</span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">An argument raised by Mr Austen was that the conclusion that Muzmatch had taken unfair advantage of the distinctive character or repute of the Match Marks was supported by the style and colours which Muzmatch used for its branding. These, he said, were initially very close to and, thereafter, tended to follow Match’s branding. As set out above, Mr Younas admits that he was aware of Match and I can see that it is likely that he kept Match’s branding in mind. However, I am not convinced that this provides Match with much real assistance. As appears from </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Planetart </span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">at [38], the concept of unfair advantage under s.10(3) does not seek to prevent a business learning from its competitors, even to the extent of (to use the words of Mr Alexander Q.C. in </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Planetart</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">) “adopting similarities in approach and presentation”. On the facts, I do not think that the evidence shows a general tendency by Muzmatch to follow or to ape Match’s branding beyond its use of the Match name. Mr Younas gave detailed evidence of how Muzmatch’s branding was chosen and evolved and, in the context of on-line dating services, I do not regard it as particularly significant that there are similarities in the use of lower case lettering, or of a heart device, or that Muzmatch (for a very short time in respect of an app to be used on smaller mobile devices) used the single letter “M” with a heart device. In other respects, Muzmatch did not follow Match’s branding.  </span></p>

In the case of a mark composed of a number of elements, the court should consider whether those interests should reasonably permit the use of all of those elements in combination, not merely some of them. </span></p>

There has to be some degree of latitude, which will depend on the circumstances of the trade. However, it must be borne in mind that this provision only comes into play after it has been found that there is not only a link between the registered trade mark and the sign but also that it has taken unfair advantage or is detrimental to the distinctive character of the trade mark in the sense that the case law has required.

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">In cases like </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:'Times New Roman'">Budweiser</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> and the other honest concurrent user cases relied on by Ms Bowhill, the use relied on as being honest concurrent use seems not to have been infringing use when it started. Indeed, in each of them, the claimant’s mark sued on was registered after (usually well after) the honest concurrent user had started. In contrast, in the present case, Muzmatch’s use started as infringing use of Match’s prior registered Mark; that use had interfered with the essential function of that Mark, had given rise to a likelihood of confusion and/or had taken unfair advantage of the reputation of that Mark. Moreover, given the 26</span><span style="vertical-align:super;font-size:smaller;font-family:'Times New Roman'">th</span><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> January 2016 letter and Match’s (successful) opposition to the registration of the Muzmatch name as an EU and a UK trade mark (see paragraphs 64-65 above), Muzmatch was well aware that Match regarded the Muzmatch Signs as infringing. In the absence of, say, estoppel or statutory acquiescence, it is difficult to see how use that starts as infringing use can be turned into honest use by the fact that it has continued. The very reason why use infringes is because, if left unchecked, its effect would be to educate the public that the mark does not indicate the services of the trade mark proprietor. It must be a very unusual case where (again, in the absence of estoppel or statutory acquiescence) a defendant can argue that continuing to infringe gives rise to a defence to an infringement claim. I do not think that this is such a case and, in my judgment, Muzmatch’s use cannot be regarded as honest concurrent use. Whilst I accept that Mr Younas did not intend to create a link to or confusion with the Match Marks (because he wrongly saw use of the word “match” as descriptive in this context and because he was serving only the Muslim community), I do not see that this can give rise to a defence when, objectively viewed, his actions infringed Match’s rights for the reasons set out above. </span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">It seems to me that Ms Bowhill’s argument is really seeking to take the concept of honest concurrent user into the sphere of acquiescence or estoppel or even of limitation (none of which features in the list of issues for this case). There is an element of this in Ms Bowhill’s submission that Mr Younas relied on representations made by Match during the settlement discussions to the effect that their concern was not use of the name Muzmatch per se, but rather, the format and style used. Ms Bowhill (rightly, in view of the matters mentioned in the previous paragraph) does not argue that this gives rise to any estoppel but simply relies on it to support her claim that Muzmatch was acting honestly. However, I cannot see that this assists Muzmatch. As I have already found, Muzmatch’s mistaken views as to the legal basis of its actions cannot transform what were infringing acts into non-infringing acts.</span></p>

            <p class="ListParagraph" style="margin-left:0.5in"><span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'">Dealing first with the issue of goodwill, Mr Austen’s argument is that by 2011 Match had acquired goodwill not only in Match.com but also in the word “Match” when used distinctively. For the reasons set out in paragraphs 24-41, in paragraph 93(a)-(e) and in paragraphs 110-111 above, I accept this argument. I find that by 2011, the 1996 Match.com Mark had acquired a substantial goodwill and that that goodwill also attached to the 2017 Match.com Mark as from its filing date of 13 January 2017. I also find that significant goodwill would have attached to the Match Device Mark soon after its filing date of 3 March 2015 given the use that was then made of it (as evidenced in, for example, the March 2016 branding report). I am also satisfied that, by 2011, Match had also acquired significant goodwill in the word “match” by itself, when used distinctively (i.e. as part of a brand) in relation to online dating services in that, by that time, such use would have been seen as indicating that the relevant goods or services emanated from the Claimants, Match. Finally, I am also satisfied that, whilst Match’s services were not specifically targeted at people in the Muslim community, its goodwill in the Match Marks and in the word Match extended into that community (see paragraphs 75 and 110 above).</span></p>

I do not mean this as a criticism of the quality of the parties’ advocacy or trial preparation (which were very high). However, I do not think that the case was suitable to be heard as a two day trial in the IPEC. In particular, with counsel being limited to a half day each for their oral submissions, I have been very reliant on their written submissions and did not have the benefit of hearing full oral submissions on various matters of factual or legal difficulty. This inevitably made writing this judgment a far lengthier and more difficult task. </span></p>

In this regard, from the evidence before me, it does not seem that this was the sort of case where either party needed the special IPEC procedures and, in particular, its cost capping rules, to help them obtain access to justice. Both appear to have fought this case as if it was normal High Court litigation.</span></p>
