For particulate matter PM10, this would be an annual mean of 16.73-18.68ug/m3, so also within AQO limits. As such the Air Quality Assessment concludes that the air quality conditions do not constrain residential development and doesn’t recommend mitigation.”</p>

It went on to identify that as a consequence “there is now a further element of conflict with the development plan in that the scheme does not fully accord with new London Plan Policy D9”. Nevertheless, the Update Report gave significant weight to the fact that the proposals would however comply with the other criteria in Policy D9 (paragraphs 16 and 22). It advised that a conflict with some development plan policies does not necessarily mean that there is an overall conflict with the development plan as a whole, as policies can pull in different directions (paragraph 17). The Update Report identified additional conflicts with the London Plan and Local Plan policies in respect of heritage, but concluded that the less than substantial harm was outweighed by the public benefits of the development. At paragraph 23, the Update Report concluded that “overall, the proposal accords” with the development plan. None of the material considerations, as set out in the Hearing Report and the Update Report, warranted refusal of planning permission. </p>

By virtue of section 18A if the application accords with the development plan and there are no material considerations indicating that it should be refused, permission should be granted.

But beyond that it still leaves the assessment of the facts and the weighing of the considerations in the hands of the decision-maker.

              <p class="Quote">In the practical application of section 18A it will obviously be necessary for the decision-maker to consider the development plan, identify any provisions in it which are relevant to the question before him and make a proper interpretation of them. His decision will be open to challenge if he fails to have regard to a policy in the development plan which is relevant to the application or fails properly to interpret it. He will also have to consider whether the development proposed in the application before him does or does not accord with the development plan. There may be some points in the plan which support the proposal but there may be some considerations pointing in the opposite direction. He will require to assess all of these and then decide whether in light of the whole plan the proposal does or does not accord with it. He will also have to identify all the other material considerations which are relevant to the application and to which he should have regard. He will then have to note which of them support the application and which of them do not, and he will have to assess the weight to be given to all of these considerations. He will have to decide whether there are considerations of such weight as to indicate that the development plan should not be accorded the priority which the statute has given to it. And having weighed these considerations and determined these matters he will require to form his opinion on the disposal of the application. If he fails to take account of some material consideration or takes account of some consideration which is irrelevant to the application his decision will be open to challenge. But the assessment of the considerations can only be challenged on the ground that it is irrational or perverse.”</p>

              <p class="Quote">21.  First, the section 38(6) duty is a duty to make a decision (or “determination”) by giving the development plan priority, but weighing all other material considerations in the balance to establish whether the decision should be made, as the statute presumes, in accordance with the plan (see Lord Clyde's speech in <span style="font-style:italic">City of Edinburgh Council</span>, at p.1458D to p.1459A, and p.1459D-G). Secondly, therefore, the decision-maker must understand the relevant provisions of the plan, recognizing that they may sometimes pull in different directions (see Lord Clyde's speech in City of Edinburgh Council , at p.1459D-F, the judgments of Lord Reed and Lord Hope in <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco Stores Ltd. v Dundee City Council </span>[2012] UKSC 13, respectively at paragraphs 19 and 34, and the judgment of Sullivan J., as he then was, in <span style="font-style:italic">R. v Rochdale Metropolitan Borough Council, ex p. Milne</span> [2001] J.P.L. 470, at paragraphs 48 to 50). Thirdly, section 38(6) does not prescribe the way in which the decision-maker is to go about discharging the duty. It does not specify, for all cases, a two-stage exercise, in which, first, the decision-maker decides “whether the development plan should or should not be accorded its statutory priority”, and secondly, “if he decides that it should not be given that priority it should be put aside and attention concentrated upon the material factors which remain for consideration” (see Lord Clyde's speech in City of Edinburgh Council , at p.1459H to p.1460D). Fourthly, however, the duty can only be properly performed if the decision-maker, in the course of making the decision, establishes whether or not the proposal accords with the development plan as a whole (see the judgment of Richards L.J. in <span style="font-style:italic">R. (on the application of Hampton Bishop Parish Council) v Herefordshire Council </span>[2014] EWCA Civ 878, at paragraph 28, and the judgment of Patterson J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Tiviot Way Investments Ltd. v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government </span>[2015] EWHC 2489 (Admin)  at paragraphs 27 to 36). And fifthly, the duty under section 38(6) is not displaced or modified by government policy in the NPPF. Such policy does not have the force of statute. Nor does it have the same status in the statutory scheme as the development plan. Under section 70(2) of the 1990 Act and section 38(6) of the 2004 Act, its relevance to a planning decision is as one of the other material considerations to be weighed in the balance (see the judgment of Richards L.J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Hampton Bishop Parish Council</span>, at paragraph 30).” </p>

The interpretation of development plan policy, however, is ultimately a matter of law for the court. The court does not approach that task with the same linguistic rigour as it applies to the construction of a statute or contract. It must seek to discern from the language used in formulating the plan the sensible meaning of the policies in question, in their full context, and thus their true effect. The context includes the objectives to which the policies are directed, other relevant policies in the plan, and the relevant supporting text. The court will always keep in mind that the creation of development plan policy by a local planning authority is not an end in itself, but a means to the end of coherent and reasonably predictable decision-making, in the public interest (see the judgment of Lord Reed in <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco v Dundee City Council</span>, at paragraphs 18 and 19; the judgment of Lord Gill in <span style="font-style:italic">Hopkins Homes</span>, at paragraphs 72 and 73; the judgment of Richards L.J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Ashburton Trading Ltd. v Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government </span>[2014] EWCA Civ 378, at paragraphs 17 and 24; and the judgment of Richards L.J. in <span style="font-style:italic">R.

Unless there is evidence to suggest otherwise, it may reasonably be assumed that, if the members followed the officer’s recommendation, they did so on the basis of the advice that he or she gave (see the judgment of Lewison L.J. in <span style="font-style:italic">Palmer v Herefordshire Council </span>[2016] EWCA Civ 1061, at paragraph 7). The question for the court will always be whether, on a fair reading of the report as a whole, the officer has materially misled the members on a matter bearing upon their decision, and the error has gone uncorrected before the decision was made. Minor or inconsequential errors may be excused. It is only if the advice in the officer’s report is such as to misdirect the members in a material way – so that, but for the flawed advice it was given, the committee’s decision would or might have been different – that the court will be able to conclude that the decision itself was rendered unlawful by that advice. </p>

There will be others where the officer has simply failed to deal with a matter on which the committee ought to receive explicit advice if the local planning authority is to be seen to have performed its decision-making duties in accordance with the law (see, for example, <span style="font-style:italic">R.

They are thus addressed to a knowledgeable readership and the adequacy of their reasoning must be considered against that background. That approach applies with particular force to a planning officer's report to a committee. Its purpose is not to decide the issue, but to inform the members of the relevant considerations relating to the application. It is not addressed to the world at large but to council members who, by virtue of that membership, may be expected to have substantial local and background knowledge. There would be no point in a planning officer's report setting out in great detail background material, for example, in respect of local topography, development planning policies or matters of planning history if the members were only too familiar with that material. Part of a planning officer's expert function in reporting to the committee must be to make an assessment of how much information needs to be included in his or her report in order to avoid burdening a busy committee with excessive and unnecessary detail.”</p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.25in">Policy D9 Part A states that the definition of “what is considered a tall building for specific localities” is a matter for individual boroughs through their local development plan. The only limit on that planning judgment is that the definition of a tall building is subject to a “floor” of 6 storeys or 18 metres. When arriving at this definition, it is implicit that a borough planning authority will need to consider the potential impacts of buildings of different heights in specific localities: that this is the case is supported by paragraph 3.9.3 in the supporting text [CB/E5] which elucidates what is meant by buildings being “tall” by reference to their relative height compared to “their surroundings” and their impact on the skyline.</p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.25in">Policy D9 Part B, paragraph 1 is linked to Part A in so far as in addition to determining what a tall building is in planning policy terms, boroughs are given the sole responsibility for determining “if there are locations where tall buildings may be an appropriate form of development” within their area i.e. in specific localities. Boroughs are not obliged to identify any such locations, nor is there a presumption that at least one area of a borough will be appropriate. The matter is left entirely to the planning judgment of the borough through the development plan process. Moreover, even in areas identified, there is no presumption that tall buildings will be consented, because, as paragraph 3.9.3 explains (building on Policy D9 Part B paragraph 1) “such proposals will still need to be assessed in the context of other planning policies… to ensure that they are appropriate for their location and do not lead to unacceptable impacts”.</p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.25in">When deciding whether and where tall buildings “may be an appropriate form of development”, boroughs will necessarily have to take into account the impacts of buildings of defined heights or features. This is obviously implicit in the word “appropriate” (referring to the appropriateness of the form of development given the particular characteristic of the locality) and “suitable” (in Policy D9 Part B paragraph 3, referring to the suitability of a particular locality <span style="font-style:italic">for tall buildings</span> given its particular characteristics and the impact of tall building on them). The supporting text at paragraph 3.9.2(1) supports this interpretation (that boroughs necessarily have to take into account impacts of potential development) since it instructs boroughs to identify locations “by assessing potential visual and cumulative impacts”. That impact assessment is intrinsic to appropriateness is also reflected in paragraph 3.9.1 of the supporting text, which recognises that tall buildings can “have detrimental visual, functional and environmental impacts <span style="text-decoration-line:underline;text-decoration-style:solid">if in inappropriate locations</span>” (underlining added).</p>

In this case it is not in dispute that the only areas identified as suitable for tall buildings in Policy DMHB10 LP DMP are Uxbridge and Hayes town centres, which identification was justified by a Townscape Character Study evidence base…..</p>

              <p class="Quote" style="margin-left:1.25in">Policy D9 Part C …. then requires “development proposals” to satisfactorily address a number of stipulated impacts, grouped into categories (visual, functional, environmental, and cumulative). Some of these impacts are familiar because they include some (visual and cumulative) that boroughs will have already had regard to when determining the heights/localities appropriateness/suitability question. The term “development proposals” does not mean <span style="font-style:italic">any </span>development proposal of <span style="font-style:italic">any </span>type: it has to be read in the context of Policy D9 as a whole, and thus logically in line with Parts A and B which precede it, and the assessment process at local plan level that is contemplated by those two parts (and explained further in the supporting text). Thus the “development proposals” which must address the stipulated impacts can only be understood to mean development proposals (i) for tall buildings as defined by boroughs under Part A (as explained in paragraph 3.9.3, “this policy applies to tall buildings as defined by the borough”….; and (ii) in locations identified as suitable by boroughs under Part B. Part C of the process for tall building regulation in London requires further examination of the detail of particular proposals that have come forward in compliance with Parts A and B: this is (amongst other things) what paragraph 3.9.3 of the supporting text is referring to when it speaks of “such proposals [i.e. proposals in areas identified as suitable] will still need to be assessed in the context of other planning policies… to ensure that they are appropriate for their location and do not lead to unacceptable impacts”. </p>

That policy did not provide any wording to compare with the “Definition” and “Locations” parts of Policy D9 and the allocation of responsibility to local planning authorities in those regards but, under the then heading “Planning decisions”, set out a list of criteria in paragraph B and C which applications should meet, which was said to be “particularly important if the site is not identified as a location for tall or large buildings” in the borough development plan. At least two of those criteria, (a) and (b), relate to location. Policy D9 is different, and obviously so – in its wording and in its objectives.</p>

Whether the court may also look at other documents that are connected with the application for the consent or are referred to in the consent will depend on the circumstances of the case, in particular the wording of the document that it is interpreting. Other documents may be relevant if they are incorporated into the consent by reference (as in condition 7 set out in para 38 below) or there is an ambiguity in the consent, which can be resolved, for example, by considering the application for consent.”</p>

              <p class="Quote">“I do not think it is necessary, or appropriate, to resort to other documents to help with the interpretation of Policy SS2. In the first place, the policy is neither obscure nor ambiguous. Secondly, the material on which Mr Edwards seeks to rely is not part of the core strategy. It is all extrinsic – though at least some of the documents constituting the evidence base for the core strategy are mentioned in its policies, text and appendices, and are listed in a table in Appendix 6. Thirdly, as Mr Moules and Mr Brown submit, when the court is faced with having to construe a policy in an adopted plan it cannot be expected to rove through the background documents to the plan's preparation, delving into such of their content as might seem relevant. One would not expect a landowner or a developer or a member of the public to have to do that to gain an understanding of what the local planning authority had had in mind when it framed a particular policy in the way that it did. Unless there is a particular difficulty in construing a provision in the plan, which can only be resolved by going to another document either incorporated into the plan or explicitly referred to in it, I think one must look only to the contents of the plan itself, read fairly as a whole. To do otherwise would be to neglect what Lord Reed said in paragraph 18 of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco Stores Ltd. v Dundee City Council</span> : that “[the] development plan is a carefully drafted and considered statement of policy, published in order to inform the public of the approach which will be followed by planning authorities in decision-making unless there is good reason to depart from it”, that the plan is “intended to guide the behaviour of developers and planning authorities”, and that “the policies which it sets out are designed to secure consistency and direction in the exercise of discretionary powers, while allowing a measure of flexibility to be retained”. In my view, to enlarge the task of construing a policy by requiring a multitude of other documents to be explored in the pursuit of its meaning would be inimical to the interests of clarity, certainty and consistency in the “plan-led system”. As Lewison L.J. said in paragraph 14 of his judgment in <span style="font-style:italic">R. (on the application of TW Logistics Ltd.) v Tendring District Council</span> [2013] EWCA Civ 9, with which Mummery and Aikens L.JJ. agreed, “this kind of forensic archaeology is inappropriate to the interpretation of a document like a local plan …”. The “public nature” of such a document is, as he said (at paragraph 15), “of critical importance”. The public are, in principle, entitled to rely on it “as it stands, without having to investigate its provenance and evolution”.”</p>

Furthermore, it is of limited value as, taken at its highest, it sets out the Secretary of State’s intentions, whereas the Court must consider the meaning of the words actually used in Policy D9, as amended by DR12, which in my view did not give effect to the expressed intentions in the letter.  However, I do consider that it is appropriate to have regard to the ITP draft London Plan Policy D9, which was referred to in the Hearing Report, and the Secretary of State’s Direction which is in the public domain and was referenced in the Update Report, and the introduction to the London Plan 2021.  This demonstrates the differences between the ITP draft version of Policy D9, on the basis of which the initial decision to grant planning permission was granted, and the final version of Policy D9, following the Secretary of State’s direction, on the basis of which the reconsideration decision was made. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In my view, the context is critical to the interpretation.  Policy D9 is a planning policy in a development plan.  By section 70(2) TCPA 1990 and section 38(6) PCPA 2004, there is a presumption that a determination will be made in accordance with the plan, unless material considerations indicate otherwise.  Thus, the decision-maker “will have to decide whether there are considerations of such weight as to indicate that the development plan should not be accorded the priority which the statute has given to it”: per Lord Clyde in <span style="font-style:italic">City of Edinburgh</span> at 1459G. Furthermore, the decision-maker must understand the relevant provisions of the plan “recognising that they may sometimes pull in different directions”: per Lindblom LJ in <span style="font-style:italic">BDW Trading Ltd </span>at [21], and extensive authorities there cited in support of that proposition. As Lord Reed explained in <span style="font-style:italic">Tesco Stores Ltd v Dundee City Council</span>, “development plans are full of broad statements of policy, many of which may be mutually irreconcilable, so that in a particular case one must give way to another”. </p>

          <content>
            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">The drafter of Policy D9, and the Defendant who is the maker of the London Plan,  must have been aware of these fundamental legal principles, and therefore that it was possible that the policy in paragraph B(3) might not be followed, in any particular determination, if it was outweighed by other policies in the development plan, or by material considerations.  It seems likely that policy provision was made for such cases, given the importance of the issue. </p>

            <p class="ParaLevel1" style="margin-left:0.5in">In considering whether to grant planning permission for a tall building which did not comply with paragraph B(3), because it was not identified in the development plan, it would surely be sensible, and in accordance with the objectives of Policy D9, for the proposal to be assessed by reference to the potential impacts which are listed in Part C.  The Claimant’s interpretation leads to the absurd result that a decision-maker in those circumstances is not permitted to have regard to Part C, and must assess the impacts of the proposal in a vacuum.</p>

Notwithstanding the non-compliance with Part B of Policy D9, the Defendant determined that the proposal accorded with the provisions of the development plan when read as a whole. That was a planning judgment, based on the benefits of the proposal, such as the contribution of much-needed housing, in particular affordable housing, and the suitability of the Site (brownfield and sustainable, with good transport).  The Defendant was satisfied, on the advice of the GLA officers, that sufficient protection from air quality impacts would be achieved.  The Defendant was entitled to make this judgment, in the exercise of his discretion. </p>

              <p class="Quote">“65.  The basic requirements of a lawful consultation have now been settled for some considerable time and are derived from the decision of Hodgson J in <span style="font-style:italic">R v Brent London Borough Council ex p Gunning</span> (1985) 84 LGR 168. They are, firstly, that the consultation should be undertaken at a time when the proposals are still at a formative stage. Secondly, the body undertaking the consultation should provide sufficient reasons and explanation for the decision about which it is consulting to enable the consultees to provide a considered and informed response. Thirdly, adequate time to allow for consideration and response must be provided. Fourthly, the responses to the consultation must be conscientiously taken into account in reaching the decision about which the public body is consulting. These principles, known as the Sedley criteria as a result of the author of the submissions upon which they were based, have recently been endorsed by the Supreme Court in <span style="font-style:italic">R(Moseley) v Haringey London Borough Council </span>[2014] UKSC 56; [2014] 1 WLR 3947 at paragraph 26.</p>

But its requirements in this context must be linked to the purposes of consultation. In <span style="font-style:italic">R(Osborn) v Parole Board </span>[2014] AC 1115, this court addressed the common law duty of procedural fairness in the determination of the person's legal rights. Nevertheless the first two of the purposes of procedural fairness in that somewhat different context, identified by Lord Reed JSC in paras 67 and 68 of his judgment, equally underlie the requirement that a consultation should be fair. First, that requirement “is liable to result in better decisions, by ensuring that the decision-maker receives all relevant information and that it is properly tested”: para 67. Second, it avoids “the sense of injustice which the person who is the subject of the decision will otherwise feel”: para 68. Such are two valuable practical consequences of fair consultation. But underlying it is also a third purpose, reflective of the democratic principle at the heart of our society. This third purpose is particularly relevant in a case like the present, in which the question was not: ‘yes or no, should we close this particular care home, this particular school etc?’ It was: ‘Required as we are, to make a taxation-related scheme for application to all the inhabitants of our borough, should we make one in the terms which we here propose?’”</p>

Such duties vary greatly depending on the particular provisions in question, the particular context, and the purpose for which the consultation is to be carried out. The duty may, for example, arise before or after a proposal has been decided upon; it may be obligatory or may be at the discretion of the public authority; it may be restricted to particular consultees or may involve the general public; the identity of the consultees may be prescribed or may be left to the discretion of the public authority; the consultation may take the form of seeking views in writing, or holding public meetings; and so on and so forth…”</p>

He went on to observe in paragraph 39:</p>

With the benefit of hindsight it will almost invariably be possible to suggest ways in which a consultation exercise might have been improved upon. That is most emphatically not the test. It must also be recognised that a decision-maker will usually have a broad discretion as to how a consultation exercise should be carried out…In reality, a conclusion that a consultation exercise was unlawful on the ground of unfairness will be based upon a finding by the court, not merely that something went wrong, but that something went ‘clearly and radically wrong’.”</p>

The advice he received was unequivocal.  Realistically, it is highly unlikely that any further representations from the Claimant in response to the Technical Note would have made any difference to the Defendant’s decision to grant planning permission.</p>
