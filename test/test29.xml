On 15 August 2018, it was also decided by way of supersession that her entitlement to income support would terminate with effect from 20 September 2018 (after the end of the eight-week “run-on” period – see paragraph 5 of Schedule 1B to the Income Support Regulations).  Her friend challenged the personal independence payment decision and was ultimately successful on 8 July 2019, when the First-tier Tribunal awarded the standard rate of the daily living component from 18 July 2018, as well as the enhanced rate of the mobility component.  Meanwhile, the claimant had not claimed universal credit but had relied on child tax credits and child benefit as her income.</span></p>

She was advised that her claim had been correctly “closed down” and that she should claim universal credit.  It appears that no formal decision was made or issued then.  On 22 July 2019, she applied for the reinstatement of her carer’s allowance, which, by a decision dated 30 August 2019, was duly re-awarded with effect from 23 July 2018.  On 6 September 2019, she again contacted the Department to seek reinstatement of her income support award and was again advised to claim universal credit without, apparently, any formal decision being made or issued.</span></p>

              <p class="Numbered" style="text-indent:0.39in"><span style="font-family:Arial">On 4 December 2019, Ms Sharon Tilt of Dudley Welfare Rights Service wrote to the Department explicitly asking for a revision of the decision of 15 August 2018 to terminate the claimant’s award of income support.  This resulted in the issuing of a “mandatory reconsideration notice” on 21 January 2020. which seems to have followed a two-stage process in which a decision-maker first decided on 7 January 2020 both that there had been no error in the decision of 15 August 2018 and that the claimant had not had any entitlement to income support since then and then another decision-maker reconsidered that decision but reached the same conclusion.  That process may have been required by the Department’s internal procedures, but it appears that only the one decision of 21 January 2020 was actually issued.  In any event, the claimant appealed against that decision with the assistance of Ms Tilt.  The appeal was received by the First-tier Tribunal on 11 February 2020 and, despite the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, was impressively heard by telephone only eight weeks later, on 8 April 2020.  </span></p>

              <p class="Numbered" style="margin-left:0in;text-indent:0.5in"><span style="font-family:Arial">The grounds of appeal to the First-tier Tribunal were expressed as though the appeal was against the refusal on 21 January 2020 to revise the decision of 15 August 2018, rather than being simply against the latter decision.  This may have been a result of the mandatory reconsideration notice having referred to the “decision” of 7 January 2020 as well as the decision of 15 August 2018.  The grounds of appeal emphasised that the application for revision had been intended to be a late application under regulation 3(1) of the Social Security and Child Support (Decisions and Appeals) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/991) “on any ground” and it was argued that the claimant’s friend’s successful appeal against the personal independence payment decision had the effect that “the decision to refuse PIP ceased to exist” and also that the reinstatement of carer’s allowance meant that the claimant had satisfied the conditions for entitlement to income support throughout the period since her award had been terminated.  Thus, it was submitted, the awards of personal independence payment and carer’s allowance were not changes of circumstances that precluded, in the light of regulation 3(9)(a), a revision under regulation 3(1).</span></p>

It was submitted that the Secretary of State could not have revised the decision of 15 August 2018 under regulation 3(1) of the 1999 Regulations because that decision had been correct at the time it was made and regulation 3(9)(a) precluded revision under regulation 3(1) on the ground of a change of circumstances since the original decision was made.  It was submitted that regulation 3(7) did not apply because there was no subsisting award of income support from 20 September 2018 and that, although the claimant would have been able to make a new claim for income support that would (by virtue of regulation 6(19) to (22) of the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987 (SI 1987/1968)) have been effective from 20 September 2018 had universal credit not been introduced in the area where she lived, universal credit had been introduced in that area and she had been precluded from making a new claim for income support by virtue of article 7(1)(a) of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 (Commencement No.23) Order 2015 (SI 2015/634).</span></p>

She reiterated her point that regulation 3(9)(a) did not apply, arguing that the First-tier Tribunal’s decision to “set aside” the Secretary of State’s decision that the claimant’s friend was not entitled to the daily living component of personal independence payment had the effect of rendering the decision made on 15 August 2018 as if “it never occurred” so that the claimant satisfied the condition of entitlement “as at the effective date of the decision she is appealing against”.</span></p>

It is now common ground that the appeal before the First-tier Tribunal could not have been against the decision of 21 January 2020 and could only have been against the decision dated 15 August 2018.  That is because, as the First-tier Tribunal obviously understood, section 12 of the Social Security Act 1998 makes provision for appeals against decisions on claims under section 8 and against decisions on supersession (including refusals to supersede) under section 10, but not against decisions on revision (including refusals to revise) under section 9.  (Strictly speaking, the power to revise a decision is conferred by section 9(1) of the 1998 Act and regulation 3 of the 1999 Regulations merely prescribes the cases or circumstances in which the power may be exercised.)  </span></p>

In the absence of any decision to revise or not revise the decision being challenged, the basic time limit for an appeal is, by virtue of rule 22(2)(d)(ii) of, and paragraph 5(a) of Schedule 1 to, the Tribunal Procedure (First-tier Tribunal) (Social Entitlement Chamber) Rules 2008 (SI 2008/2685), one month from the date of the decision being challenged.  However, the First-tier Tribunal took the view that “a decision not to revise extends the time for appealing against the decision that has not been revised” (paragraph 28 of its statement of reasons).  That is generally so, not due to the effect of section 9(5) of the 1998 Act (which applies to revisions but not to refusals to revise), but due to the effect of rule 22(2)(d).  </span></p>

Time may be extended, but not by more than 12 months, and such an extension is treated as having been given if the Secretary of State does not object (rules 5(3)(a) and 22(5) and (8)).  Unsurprisingly, there is a similar “absolute time limit” of 13 months when applying for revision under regulation 3(1) of the 1999 Regulations.  The basic one month for making an application under regulation 3(1) may be extended under regulation 4 to not more than 13 months.  </span></p>

Similarly, as mandatory reconsideration did apply, there was no right of appeal insofar as the application had been made under regulation 3(1) because, where an application for revision is rejected because it was made after that absolute time limit, the application has not been “considered” for the purpose of regulation 3ZA(2) of the 1999 Regulations (</span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">PH v Secretary of State for Work and Pensions (DLA)</span><span style="font-family:Arial"> [2018] UKUT 404 (AAC); [2019] AACR 14) and, furthermore, the reasoning in R(IS) 15/04 – </span><span style="font-style:italic;font-family:Arial">i.e.</span><span style="font-family:Arial">, that there had been no effective application for revision and thus no jurisdiction to make a revision decision, including a refusal to revise – applies even if the Secretary of State did not actually notice that the application was out-of-time.  </span></p>

Ms Tilt was right to accept in her application for permission to appeal that section 12(8)(b) of the 1998 Act was therefore important, rather than regulation 3(9)(a) of the 1999 Regulations.  The question whether the Secretary of State had had power to revise the decision under appeal was strictly irrelevant (except in relation to the jurisdictional point mentioned above).  However, although expressed in different language, section 12(8)(b) of the 1998 Act has the same practical effect in relation to appeals as regulation 3(9)(a) of the 1999 Regulations has in respect of revisions under regulation 3(1), which is to prohibit account being taken of any change of circumstance since the decision being challenged.

The beginning (and end, if any) of that period would have marked a material change of circumstances, but the making of the decision itself would not have been such a change.  Thus, although, the decision of 15 August 2018 had appeared to be correct at the time it was made, it was shown both by the decision of the First-tier Tribunal given on 8 July 2019, awarding the claimant’s friend the daily living component of personal independence payment from 18 July 2018, and by the decision of the Secretary of State given on 30 August 2019, re-awarding the claimant carer’s allowance from 23 July 2018, to have been wrong when it was made.  </span></p>

Indeed, this must apply not only to decisions as to a claimant’s underlying entitlement but also to decisions as to whether a benefit is “payable”, which is the term used where a claimant has not only an underlying “entitlement” but also an entitlement to receive payments.  The term “payable” is clearly used in that sense in section 70(2) of the 1992 Act in relation to carer’s allowance (see paragraph 3, above).  The most obvious situation in which a claimant might have an underlying entitlement to personal independence payment but that benefit may cease to be payable is where he or she has been residing in a care home or hospital for a prolonged period of time.  </span></p>

However, the omission of personal independence payment in that provision is explicable because that benefit is always disregarded as income (see paragraphs 6 and 9 of Schedule 9) and, in any event, the point of regulation 31(2) is to ensure that the mentioned benefits are treated as having been payable on a daily basis, rather than weekly or four-weekly.  It therefore does not assist in the present case and I have not derived any assistance from other provisions of the 1987 Income Support Regulations either.</span></p>

If the decision of the tribunal awarding the daily living component of personal independence payment to the claimant’s friend with effect from 18 July 2018 and the decision of the Secretary of State awarding carer’s allowance to the claimant from 23 July 2018 did not have the effect that the claimant’s friend and she were to be regarded as having been in receipt of those benefits from those dates onwards, there would have been no basis for awarding the claimant income support in respect of any period before, at the earliest, 8 July 2019, because neither of the conditions of entitlement under paragraph 4(a) and (b) would have been satisfied from any earlier date.  Regulation 6(19) to (21) of the 1987 Claims and Payments Regulations would have allowed a claim in the absence of article 7(1)(a) of the Welfare Reform Act 2012 (Commencement No.23) Order 2015, but the claim could not have been successful in respect of any date before 8 July 2019.  That would plainly have been unfair and would have undermined what is obviously the intended effect of regulation 6(19) and (21).  I am therefore satisfied that the words “in receipt of” in paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 to the 1987 Income Support Regulations are not to be given their literal meaning but are to be read as “entitled to receive payments of”.  Such entitlement may be conferred by a decision made retrospectively.</span></p>

It follows that the conditions of paragraph 5 of Schedule 1B were not satisfied from then until 19 September 2018, although benefit paid in respect of that latter period should be treated as having been paid on account.</span></p>

              <p class="Numbered" style="text-indent:0.39in"><span style="font-family:Arial">That is not to say that the Secretary of State was wrong to argue that making a new claim after the First-tier Tribunal’s decision of 8 July 2019 would have been the normal way of obtaining income support in a case like this before universal credit was introduced.  It is not in dispute that the Secretary of State’s submission to the First-tier Tribunal correctly summarised the effect of the legislation apart from regulation 3(1) of the 1999 Regulations.  Moreover, there are obvious reasons why provision for making claims following decisions of tribunals in respect of “qualifying benefits” should have been made.  One is that it avoids any difficulty there might otherwise be with the time limits for bringing an appeal or applying for a revision.  Another is that it ensures that the claimant completes a new form that elicits evidence as to his or her circumstances relevant to other conditions of entitlement, so that any change in such circumstances between the removal of a qualifying benefit and its reinstatement is not overlooked.  </span></p>
